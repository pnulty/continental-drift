Ele pode ser um porco preconceituoso, conservador, manipulador e gastadeiro, mas deixar esse atual governo com o pão, a manteiga e a faca se mostrou algo extremamente perigoso. Problemas na Petrobrás, por exemplo, podem ter começado lá nos anos do FHC ou de Getúlio Vargas, mas os valores sendo discutidos atualmente são sem precedentes.

Nada contra a Dilma, mas ela não tem força política para controlar a ala questionável do PT. Eu sinceramente acho que a solução para o sistema presidencialista seria ter sempre alguém **neutro** (ideal) ou em oposição ao Presidente da República como presidente da Câmara porque evita abusos.

Pelo menos o ânimo da população não está muito bom para tolerar esse tipo de desperdício e eu acredito que o Eduardo Cunha deve estar testando os limites dele com esses projetos. Dificilmente essa idéia sai do papel.

Yet when colonization began in earnest a few decades later, they found almost nothing but empty wilderness and a handful of scattered, burned-out tribes.

However, it's not universal in the West either. It is significant that the word chosen, all those hundreds of years ago, was ""impression"": it suggests a very passive role for the mind, which (so it was said by the European empiricists) is acted upon by the organs of sense and has its contents deterministically moulded by the same. Consider the ""impression"" made by a seal onto a bit of hot wax.

With that in mind, it's not surprising that European thinkers who argued on behalf of the power of mind to shape itself used different terminology. Spinoza and, later, Kant used ""intuition"" to emphasize the immediate cognitive contact between mind and the action of sensibility.

You mentioned ""contact"", and I think that captures the basic idea of ""intuition"". Perhaps it would be a better translation.

It actually has three leagues overall; The North American Baseball Conference, the European Baseball Conference, and the Asian Baseball Conference. It began play in 2015, and I am currently beginning the 2052 season.

I play in the North American Baseball Conference, as the Philadelphia Blackbirds. We've always had relative success in our division, since it has never been the hardest division, there always being a clear divide between good and bad teams. The Carolina Barons have usually been my biggest rivals for the CL Central.

It was the mid 2040s that my team really started to dominate. The Manhattan Monarchs had been the best team in the NABC for a good bit, winning three American Grand Finals (our WS) in a row, and participating in 4 in a row. They were really the Yankees of the game, and started their snowball success in the 40s. My success began here too. The following is a list of players in this 40s-50s dynasty I am going through.

**Laurentij Daniltsev** is a Russian infielder I got in the early 40s, a young 20-something year old from the ABC's Hong Kong Tigercats. He stayed on my team from his 27-year-old season to his 30-year-old season, batting in the high .200s. He was a general crowd favorite, a face of the franchise. He enjoyed 1 AGF with the club.

**Harvey Teller** was a top prospect when I got him, a German from the Cologne Owls that I got for an Indian pitcher I'd end up getting back. (scroll through this sub for the ""Million Dollar Arm"" post; that's him) He muddled  through injuries early in his career, but has stayed off the list in recent years, and has been one of the best Blackbirds in history. This kid has tremendous 19-out-of-20 power.

**Laurent Pelle** was a Frenchie who spent most of his career in Europe. I picked him up at age 30 and ran with him 3 years; he was a crowd favorite and put up some respectable numbers. A real base-stealer. 

**Pacu Milutinovic** stayed in the club for about 6 years. He is from Serbia, and was primarily a designated hitter, due to his tremendous home run power. He could play outfield too, though, and ended up doing that his last 2 years with the club as a 1B became our new DH, an above-average slugger named PJ Southcott.

**Choon-mo Park** was received as a prospect, and has been our 2B the last few years. He is only 25 and can run like a motherfucker.

**Justin Cole** is 22, and has already won an AGF with us. He is a 1B, and is amazing. All the teams want him, but he is too solid for me to give up. Gotta keep that dynasty alive. 

**Roberto Ortega** is an expensive but dynamic 27-year-old outfielder. He rounded off a Teller-Ortega-Milutinovic outfield. Now a Dutchman named Gerd Slot is filling Milutinovic's spot. Or should I say, slot.

**Hector Sanchez** was our catcher for a while, along with some dude named Regis Joly. He wanted too much money after 5 years with the team, so I dumped him into free-agency. An unspectacular Korean named Won-Jun Ka played his spot for one year, but I just got a German named Joss Weinsheimer for the job. He played fantastically well in Prague.

**David Koubek** has been my closer for 7 years, and will be for 3 more. Normally I don't sign guys until they are 36, but Koubek is one of the best closers in the history of the NABC. His career ERA is 1.86, and he has been playing for 9 years.

As far as starters go, they have been my weakness. My fantastic offense has made up for them, but they've changed around a lot.

&gt; We're ennemy for everything : politics, religion, science,

  This is a bizarre statement. There have been some disputes over how the EU should run, but to suggest an enmity is to inflate the situation beyond all reality. The UK and France are not only close allies within the wider alliances of the EU and NATO, but share a joint nuclear deterrent. Furthermore, to suggest that France and the UK, two of the least religiously observant countries on earth, are religious enemies is ridiculous. Enemies in science? That doesn't even make sense.

  Now, you'll notice that in my original post, I was talking about England and not the UK, and there are specific reasons for this. After the fall of the Roman Empire, both regions received significant Germanic migrations - Franks in northern France and Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians in England. While France ended up becoming part of the Carolingian Empire, its real origins lie in the break-up of that Empire, with the Kingdom of West Francia. Incidentaly, this happened round about the same time as England came to be seen as a single entity. Both suffered from Norse raids, and in England the Danelaw was established around York while in France Rollo was granted the duchy of Normandy. As we know, Rollo's descendent, William the Bastard, became King of England in 1066. For three hundred years, English Kings spoke Norman French, and Kings of England held various Duchies in France at various times (notably Aquitaine). The basic dispute between England and France was one of control. English Kings believed they were the rightful Kings of France (the Hundred Years War was fought with this idea at it's root), and English Kings kept ""King of France"" as one of their official titles until the 17th century in spite of it having no real meaning. 

  Anyway, I'll cut it short: The two countries (England as part of the UK for most of this section) built the two largest colonial Empires and were, for the better part of 200 years, the two most powerful European nations, at least in terms of world affairs. This still rings true - both nations have permanent positions on the UN security council, both have sizeable nuclear arsenals, and both hold probably the only globally deployable militaries on earth aside from the USA (Canada is another possible candidate). 

  Now, imagine if the two nations had been conjoined. The political stability of the English and the philosophical depth of the French? French cuisine and English sheep? The fantastic record of the French army and the almost unbeatable English Navy? English industrial ingenuity and French social mobility and public intellectualism? Fuck me, we would have been unstoppable, and the map of the world, nevermind the balance of power, would have been markedly different over the last 300 years. 

  So, yeah, as an Englishman, I think it would have been a very interesting prospect.

Perpetually extending their crises so they can then offer them space to breathe in exchange for another all-holes-allowed economic gangbang? This is unprecedented. America in particular could be extremely vindictive and violent towards nations that rejected its authority, but within their realm they clearly believed that as the 'leader of the free world' they had certain responsibilities. See: The Marshall Plan, the protection of the Kurds after the Gulf War, their crucial role in the Northern Ireland peace process, the current operations in Ukraine and against ISIS, lobbying Germany on behalf of their erstwhile NATO ally Greece, and so on. They're even using the ISIS crisis to pressure Baghdad into cutting down on anti-Sunni sectarianism. The USSR was similar - they pumped money into Eastern Europe to the extent that countries which were once on the same economic tier as Bolivia are now richer and more developed than Russia itself, their intervention in the Yom Kippur war basically forced the US to order Israel to the negotiating table, their Afghan proxies forced gender equality on a highly conservative society. In both cases these good acts were overshadowed by a backdrop of extreme violence and imperialism but in Germany's case all I see is self-interest. It's as if their chancellor is a highly complex AI algorithm designed to maximise German profits. There is no moral component. Where is Merkel in Iraq, or in Palestine, or in Kurdistan?

Of course it does. You can't provide for people without having something to begin with. That's pretty basic.

&gt;  I said that we have the technology to take care of everyone.

What technology will do this for everyone?

&gt; Well, maybe I got ahead of myself. I really don't know, but I really don't care about China or India. They have to solve their own problems.

Us over-consuming global resources is their problem?

&gt; Nuclear, wind, solar

None of these replace oil. And even if they could, the world would need to build 15,000 nuclear plants to produce as much energy as  fossil fuels currently provide. I think the world has something like 450 right now. And it's impossible to build that many nuclear power plants without an enormous expenditure of fossil fuels.

Wind and solar? We've experienced record-breaking growth of these in the last five years, to the point that they now supply a minuscule 1.5% of global energy consumption. And they're both staggeringly energy poor. The largest wind farm in Europe provides a third of the energy used by a single Boeing 747 in flight. And both solar and wind technologies are totally dependent of fossil fuels. Constructing just one wind turbine needs 3,600 barrels of oil or energy-equivalent in other fossil fuels. Guess how many wind turbines need to be built to supply the world with just current needs?

&gt; We've known about these technologies for a very ling time.

But lots of people know very little about them, which means they aren't aware of their limitations. 

&gt; A) Fossil fuels will run out.  

Of course they will. No dispute at all.

&gt; B) There are alternatives to fossil fuels.

Not when it comes to agriculture. There is simply no technology to replace fossil fuels in agriculture. None. There are no solar or wind-based fertilizers, there's no battery-powered industrial agricultural equipment (and there won't be for a very long time, probably forty years or so), there's no battery-powered transportation systems (and won't be for a similar period). And before you start talking about the Tesla and its batteries, look up the topic of energy density and why heavy equipment can't run on batteries.

&gt; A) You have no idea how I've lived my life.

I'm not sure what your life has to do with it, I was referring to your comments about housing, water, and power.

B) There are plenty of alternatives to fossil fuels.

Not as energy-rich ones as fossil fuels. Just because energy can be obtained from other sources doesn't mean that it's the same amounts of energy, or that they're as energy-rich or as energy-dense (which is a huge factor). Every year the world obtains the equivalent of a million years worth of fossilized solar energy from fossil fuels. There is no technology or other energy source that can provide that kind of energy wealth.

&gt; No, you're just incapable of thinking outside of your obsolete little box and I'm not going to waste my time hand holding you so that you come to reasonable conclusions about the world we live in.

You're being a baby. You obviously don't have much knowledge about economics, or the technologies that you think a panacea to the world's problems.

We are actually wired by evolution to be intolerant to anything outside of a certain ""comfort zone"". It is purely a survival mechanism, and surely an outdated one, but it does play a role in things like racism and wars and such. If humans were wired to be tolerant Israel and Palestine would be cutting land deals and Hitler would have shared his technology and financial ability with the world instead of trying to conquer it and attempting to exterminate the Jewish population in Europe to begin with. We instead choose to slaughter each other over things like oil, religion, and color, instead of working together to extend what we have.

Hitler is remarkable because his murderous nature was hidden behind a pristine nationwide facade. Unlike normal dictators, Hitler was very beneficial to the lifestyles of the German people and by 1936 the entire nation lives a relatively semi-upper middle class lifestyle. It's near perfect (and perfectly uniform). Meanwhile, Hitler's got the body factories running full tilt hidden behind the slick scenery.

&gt;* Lithuania said it had signed a trade agreement to buy liquified natural gas from the United States in a move aimed at reducing the EU Baltic state's heavy dependence on Russian gas deliveries.

&gt;* The Baltic states' reliance on Russia for gas is a legacy of its five decades of Soviet rule, which ended in 1991.

&gt;* Lithuania's first floating LNG terminal started commercial activity in January, becoming the first such facility to sever Moscow's grip on gas deliveries to the Baltic states.

this a rainy weekend/insominia game, that a 2-3 hour at a time is really the shortest amount of time i can play and get any real satisfaction.

second the power of your country is not a matter of your own power, but realative to your nearest neighbors.
so you play a one province minor in ireland, great you have all weak neighbros, easy right?
now you conqured them all and are on a tiny island that is sourounded by the strongest countries in the game, good luck getting any further.

but let say you play a one province minor in east aisa, you have a decent challange swallowing your neighbors, but then you are a mid sized power surrounded by mid sized powers, that all most likly have larger neighbors to the north and west. which means you can still expand and play on a fairly forgiving basis.

the difficulty of a campaign is an impossible variable. britian could fall to peices in revolt by some odd chance letting you eat up the opms as they pop out, or Brittan can united the island very early and pretty much doom you.

also considering trade is kind of weird, i would suggest playing a small node holder, yemen, or malacca are nice option.


p.s. i encourage all people to play outside europe, it can very enjoyable and diffrent from an hre focused game.
there is also the fact that outside europe poses the best difficulty curve, where at the end of the game you are fighting super states that can wreck you instead dominating the globe with out a competitor in sight,

Section 2. [**Greenacres Caravan Park raid**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Netwing#Greenacres_Caravan_Park_raid) of article  [**Operation Netwing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation%20Netwing): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;At 0530 [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) on 11 September 2011, approximately 100 police officers from [BHMCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHMCU) and other specialist units including the dog section, force helicopter and [Authorised Firearms Officers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorised_Firearms_Officer), raided the caravan park to execute [search warrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant). As a result, four men and one woman were arrested and a further 24 men, all believed to be victims of slavery, were taken from the site.   

&gt;The arrests were made under the provisions of Section 71 of the [Coroners and Justice Act 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroners_and_Justice_Act_2009), implemented in April 2010 to comply with [Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_4_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights), which made it a criminal offence to hold someone ""in slavery or servitude, or requir[e] them to perform forced or compulsory labour.""   The youngest of the 24 was a 17-year-old boy, who, when released, returned to his family. Nine of the freed men later discharged themselves from hospital and refused to assist police. One of the nine accused the police of heavy-handed tactics, saying he had lived on the caravan site for several years working as a paver for £50 a day, claiming many of the other men were similarly paid. 

&gt;Initial news reports claimed that the police had been warned 28 previous times that captives were being held at the caravan park, or that 28 captives escaped, but officers explained that this was ""a misunderstanding"", and that the witness whose allegation had launched the operation in April had told them that 28 people were still being held as slaves.  Most of the 24 were said to be have been homeless or suffering from alcoholism.  Police also found drugs, money and weapons during the raid. 

&gt;Of the fifteen freed men helping police, eight were of British nationality, three Polish, one Latvian and one Lithuanian, with two men of unconfirmed nationality, and ranged in age from 30 to 57 years.   They were being housed temporarily at a [British Red Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Red_Cross) rest centre set up to provide shelter for them while alternative accommodation was found and other necessary arrangements made. A Red Cross spokesperson said: ""Our emergency response volunteers are offering emotional support and giving the men any practical help they need, such as clothing and hygiene kits. We have also provided recreational activities such as games, a radio and DVDs."" 

&gt;On 12 September 2011, the [Crown Prosecution Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service) (CPS) announced that Tommy Connors (30), Patrick Connors (19), James Connors (34) and James Connors (23) had been charged with ""conspiracy to hold a person in servitude and requiring them to perform forced labour"" and were remanded in custody to appear at Luton Magistrates' Court on 13 September 2011.  A spokesman CPS Thames and Chiltern Complex Casework Unit explained: ""These charges relate to four victims who allege they have been held against their will and forced to live and work like slaves.""  A fifth person arrested, a woman, Josie Connors (aged 30), whom police revealed was pregnant, was originally released on police bail to be questioned further following the ""imminent"" birth of her child.   However, on 15 September, she was charged with four offences related to activities at the Greenacres site. At a subsequent hearing, on 22 September, she was remanded on bail until 5 December 2011, on condition that she remained at home and only left to give birth at [Stoke Mandeville Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_Mandeville_Hospital), [Aylesbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aylesbury). 

&gt;Speaking on 12 September [Detective Chief Inspector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Chief_Inspector) (DCI) Sean O'Neil of BHMCU said: ""I am confident that while the investigation is in its early stages this is a family-run 'business' and is an [organised crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime) group that has been broken up by the Netwing operation.""  DCI O'Neil explained: ""Some of these people have come out covered in excrement and dirty clothing because that was all they were allowed to live in. After being cared for, given food and fresh clothing, we hope to then interview them. That in itself will take a long time because these people are [institutionalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_syndrome). One person we know has been here fifteen years, so to him this is normal life."" 

&gt;On 21 September 2011, three further arrests took place at the caravan park. One of those arrested, Johnny Connors (30), was charged later that day with four offences including conspiracy to hold someone in servitude, and conspiracy to require someone to perform forced labour. The other two arrested were a woman (61) remanded in custody, and a man (51) who was released on police bail pending medical treatment.  Tommy Conners (senior; aged 51) was subsequently charged on 3 October 2011 with 11 offences of conspiracy to place people in servitude or forced labour. 

&gt;On 5 December 2011, 7 people arrested in this case appeared at [Luton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luton) [Crown Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Court) on 16 counts of conspiracy to hold a person in [servitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentured_servitude) and requiring a person to perform [forced labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labour). They are: 

&gt;


&gt;* Tommy Connors, Sr. (51)

&gt;* Johnny Connors (30; son of Tommy)

&gt;* Josie Connors (30; daughter of Tommy)

&gt;* James Connors (33; son-in-law of Tommy)

&gt;* Tommy Connors, Jr. (26, son of Tommy)

&gt;* James (Jimmy) Connors (23; son of Tommy)

&gt;* Patrick Connors (19; son of Tommy)

&gt;Only Josie was released on bail and the rest were kept in custody. On 11 July 2012, Tommy Connors senior, James John Connors, Patrick Connors, and Josie Connors were convicted of controlling, exploiting, verbally abusing and beating the men for financial gain at the caravan site near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. The trial lasted 13 weeks.

Stalin was power hungry as they get and there was no choice, but to embrace him or die - personally I feel that Stalin will always be a black stain on Russia's history and a text book case of ""what's the worst a radical state leader can do"", that said I do not think he was 'worse than Hitler', but certainly comparable in his own ways - Hitler had his delusions and Stalin had his own, both resulted in millions of people dead.

He didnt come to power on his own either, the Bolsheviks in their day were extremists who were funded by Germany and co to destabilize Emperor Nicholas' Russian empire. Once the Bolsheviks came into power they obliterated Russias culture and people. I personally hate all the leadership of the USSR, non of them were elected or chosen by people, they were all grossly incompetent except for Stalin - who was competent, but not in a good way. It makes me cringe like nothing else watching Kruschev and Nixons kitchen debate, that the USSR had such a good thing going and they spent 20-30% of the GDP on the military, that Brezhnev was literally vain with medals and that Stalin invented a new super military rank exclusively for himself... 

All these people are not real leaders with experience and personal maturity, they are just thieves who wormed their way into power and poisoned Russia. People were not allowed to start businesses and there was almost no international trade, it just blows my mind how bad they were, a lot of Russias problems come from decades of subversion by the Anglo-Saxons, but some of this is also just an excuse to brush off the responsibility off Russia's leadership. Russia is an incredibly hard place to govern, many fools want to become its leader just because of the power it gives them - controlling the state with the most land, most nukes and largest European population sounds like a dream job, but being the leader of Russia is actually a really difficult, thankless and shitty job - angry mobs gang banged the last emperor and his whole family, now he's officially been canonized and all the Russians I know wish the USSR never happened and some 30% of Russians actually want a return to a monarchy, thats how bad they wish the last 100 years in Russia didn't happen. Russia's entire history is filled with suffering and martyrdom and today people feel much the same, but our history has made us tough and survivalist. 

I feel really gutted that the ideas of communism were stained so badly by Mao and Stalin as well as the USSR, it isnt about war or dominating people, or KGB etc.. its just become associated with all that now because those governments went about things in the wrong way, instead of trying to bargain for public opinion in the media like they do now they picked the most primitive and worst option - to simply cut people from western propaganda, instead of using the media as a way to do interstate public debate.

It would be good if we could stop fighting each other in Europe because this has been going on for thousands of years and its just too costly to fight nowadays, but I feel that America has a very strong influence in Europe and if Russia was incorporated into Europe - it would greatly diminish America's influence there as well as globally, so America will do anything and everything to stop Russia from holding hands with Europe.

I think there might be war because America, like Nazi Germany has too much confidence after a string of military victories, their propaganda is increasingly loud and bold, leaves little room for moderate perspectives.
There is no news network to cater to moderate views, its always extremism one way or the other.",,cp0n4im,False,0,False,1427515212,t1_cozubj7,1,russia,,t1_cp0n4im,1425192427,t5_2qh75,,0

You think women are ""independent"" there?  Where does the money come from?  From ""government""?

Hey look, everyone.  It's another European socialist who thinks 'money comes from government'.

Let me tell you what's really going on in Scandinavia:

For centuries, men used to be the heads of their households and they would generate income for their wives and families because in return they received their household support.   (The 'old saw' that women were merely ""work horses"" or ""household slaves"" always conveniently discounts the fact that men labored all day to support them).  

Then, in the 1960's, Scandinavian feminists decided they didn't want to have to serve their husbands.   But who would pay their bills?  Who would help raise their children?  

(Here comes the big lie)

Answer:  ""The government""!  

Except, as we all know:  Governments actually have no money (Norway excepted, of course).  It all comes from tax payers.   So where would the money come from to support these single women and fatherless children?   From men, of course.

See, Scandinavian feminists love to lie and say that ""women pay taxes too"".  It's bullshit.  They receive on average a greater value in benefits than they pay in taxes -- at a ratio of 3:2 (and often more).    So women on average extract value from ""government"" and men on average are forced to pay more than they extract.  In other words, all men are now forced to pay for families that aren't theirs.

And here's the rub:  Men no longer get the household support of their wives because Scandinavian women are all smoking the ""independent feminist"" bong.  So the financial support that women used to get from their husbands in return for being good wives, they now extract from their husbands via legislation -- in return for absolutely nothing.  Men in Scandinavia are now legally, financially subservient to all women.

Welcome to Scandinavia.  Where men are tax slaves to the master-gender:  Women.

You couldn't pay me to live there.  I'll fuck their spoiled, expectation-addled, feminist bitches though.

0,NihilistFaceHair,9,False,t3_2xjjtr,"Spoken language is made of phonemes - the individual sounds that exist in that language. English phonemes are actually extremely inconsistent with the Latin alphabet. For instance, Latin doesn't have a soft C. There are more phonemes in English than there are letters. Consider ""th"", ""sh"", or that each vowel letter can stand for 2-3 different sounds. There are also letters in the modern English alphabet that didn't exist in Latin, like J. Many languages that use the Latin alphabet use diacritics (accent marks) for phonemes that don't fit the standard letters.

Cyrillic, which was invented by Byzantine monks to convert eastern Europeans to Christianity, recently became the new alphabet of Mongolian because it fits their phonemes very closely. Before, Mongolian has a vertical script, but now they use Cyrillic with a few extra letters for phonemes that it doesn't cover. Uzbek and other languages central Asian former Soviet republics can be written in Latin or Cyrillic letters, and the choice can become a political one.

Pinyin is one of several ways to transliterate Chinese, i.e. write Chinese phonemes in English letters. Chinese phonemes are extremely different from any European language. For some arbitrary reason, x was chosen to represent a sound similar to (but significantly different from) ""sh"", same for q and ""ch"". Chinese does not have a phonetic alphabet, so without pinyin, there would be no way for people who don't speak Chinese to sound out the words.

Watched it? Good. Now here is a few points to consider before you write off the only known place to support life in the entire galaxy.

1. If humans do die, it's not the end of all life. There have been six major extinction events in the earths history. With that in mind, even after every extinction event, we still have a variety of plants and animals, so even if our civilization goes down the toilet, life will continue. Which brings me to my second point.

2. Humans will continue. A great many will die out, that's what happens when your species over capacitances an ecosystem, but I have faith that some form of the human race will continue.

3. Don't think of it as loss, but as destruction. Yes, something's will never come back. Dinosaurs, wooly mammoths and, from the looks of it, the white Rhino will be gone forever. But that opens up a niche, which means that at some point in the future, either the ecosystem will evolve to create new niches or new species will evolve to fit it's place. Forests can regrow and animals will adapt given time. But it's up to us to plant the first seeds. Which leads to the next point.

4. There are literally thousands of things to do to fight climate change and to save species. Good thing we literally have billions of potential hands to help us out. It kinda ensures that, if you do go into the field and try to fight climate change, you will always have a job. It might not pay in cash, but you'll gain other things. Knowlage. Understanding of the world. Friends. Memories. It offers a chance for the next generation to rebuild. One of the biggest lies is that your just one person and you can't do much. Try something simple. Plant 1 kind of edible plant per year. Not just a little strawberry plant but a full on pepper bush. In a 3-4 year period you'd have enough food plants in your backyard to remove a good 20-40$ from groceries each week. And that's just from a weekly 20 minute watering period. You just need to imagine a reality for your life.

5. You are not responsible for the world, everyone is. Like in that video, we only have two hands to hold up one section of he earth. Me? I'm putting my hands into the California coast and wild life. I'm trusting other people to take care of Europe, Florida, and Ohio. I may not be able to shake things up in Washington DC but I sure as hell can pick up the trash on my street and work on starting a comunity food garden. And I also get to give speaches in schools as part of an internship. So relax. Other people know of the problems too, your not alone.

6. Get some friends who can do activities with you. I'll be honest with you. Planting a tree alone is not fun. It's hot, sweaty, and you'll need a shower afterwards. What is fun? Blasting sing along songs in my front yard as me and my friends plant a tree, wash my car, and share a homemade lunch together inside the house. Then after a few drinks I can maybe get Sarah in the bed room an- *ahem*. Point is, with friends, you can do a lot more, for a fraction of the work and making much better memories. Plus you get in shape!

7. The odds are against us. People have told us so. People also told is we couldn't wear socks and Sandels, go to the moon, or that you couldn't make exploding lemons when life gives you regular lemons. We nodded our heads, looked at one another and then put into place casual Friday's, put more than one man on the moon, and we created an underground facility to test a portal device and manufacture mobility enhancing gel made from moon rocks. Wait... That's not quite right....

8. You want to learn about sustainable agriculture? Easy, look up ""Permaculture"" to get an idea of what I'm talking about. Then look up Bill Gates water and Poop matchine! The pictures of cats, lots of cats. Point is. The world is always changing. Before, people thought that a nuclear bomb would destroy the entire world. Before that, they thought a giant snake would swallow the sun and the world would end, and even further back, they believed the world would end in 2012. Did it? NO! it just changed a little bit! Change weather for good or bad results in new opportunities and new innocations. Look at grapes for example! First they're good fruits! Then they spoil, but after that they make wine! FLIPPIN ALCOHOL! All because you forgot that one juice pouch at the back of the fridge during the school year! Amazing! Point is, every cloud has a silver lining. (And trace amounts of actual silver but that's ok, there hardly any health risks and it should be gone in the next 20 years) Everything is going to come with it's own sets of problems, it's your job to see if those are the kind of problems you'd like to solve.

9. Use your noggin! One lady in England decided to fuck her day job and write 7 whole novels about a kid attendin school. Another dude decided he'd take his old ARC car from when he was a kid, and supersize it into a Tesla. A guy who couldn't get a boner invent Viagra. Point is, the human brain is a remarkable thing. Try doing absolutely nothing for 15 minutes. No walking, no talking, no phone, no TV, no books. Just sit and stare at the wall. In those 15 minutes you'll have roughly 2000-7000 completely seprate thoughts. Many of them will be comentary on your current situation, some will be memories but a sizable ammount will be ideas,plans, and weird little observations you can write down and make use of. Have you ever heard of McGuiver? A crazy old TV show where a guy would literally use soda, some chewing gum and some string to fight crime and save people. Point is, by using the things your learning now and in the future, you'll come up with original ideas. Start listening to TEDTalks to get an idea of the actual scope of human creativity and innovation. So saying there is no solution to climate change, or anything else really, is a large pile of frozen corn dogs. A better phrasing is ""that we do not yet have a plan that is possible/does not involve floating patches of mangrove trees.""  

But maybe, just maybe, someone will find a way to have mangrove trees float, and we'll have giant floating forests to clean are oceans like those automatic vaccume robots you can buy online for about 30$.

So have hope. Worst case scenario, we all die. Best case? We all die. We're gonna die one way or another, but we have the choice of what kind of life we'll live. One where we run to the cool new things and gain experiences and memories that'll be utterly unique? Or where we run away from things because they look big and scary and its *hard learning about all the nasty things out there"". And we end up living our lives hiding under our sheets? 

Life's a jungle, and you can either be the Chamelion blending in with everything else, hoping that you don't die and your meal will fly to you, or you can be Tarzan and swing through the vines to grab your meal on your spear before making wild monkey love to a cute British girl.

Yugoslavia was called by Victor Hugo as the place that would be ""the cause of all wars.""  It was the border of the Ottoman Empire, European Empires, and Russian empires.  It was a place where more ethnicities existed than possible.

So when Tito took over the region with the help of the British his big plan was to go through a process of eradicating cultures (similar to Russofication and Sinofication).  The Croats of course resisted the change.  The Croats aligned themselves with the Nazis during WW2 and the Austro-Hungarians during WW1, so not treated particularly well by Serbs.

Tito created a language called Serbo-Croat that took pieces of both languages but used the Roman alphabet.  Speaking other languages was banned and basically three cultures (Albanian, Serbian, and Croatian) were destroyed.

So when Tito dies militias and leaders form within various regions all out for each other's bloods.  The Serbs caused WW1, the Croats sided with the Nazis, Tito was a Serb, it was all tit for tat.  The fighting and blood shed between the two was unheard of.  People would walk into entire villages and napalm every single person.  Orders were given to execute women and children on the spot to try and prevent the other side from procreating.

The Albanians were also a target, they didn't have much of an army themselves and were relatively innocent in all of the matters.  During the Kosovo War, Albanians decided that Kosovo was going to be their own independent country and separate from Yugoslavia like everyone else did.  The Serbian army (Republic of Yugoslavia) came in and began a process they called ""ethnic cleansing.""  The Albanians that didn't leave the land were being killed en masse.

When NATO intervened and saw the damage special teams were setup to capture the leaders of all the factions.  They put 74 of them on trial total.  36 cases were withdrawn due to the indicted dying before the trial could end.  20 of them are still on-going.  26 are in front of appeals court and 2 were convicted but died in prison.  Hundreds of lesser generals were also put on trial with roughly similar numbers.

The big fish was Slobodan Milosevic, the leader of Republic of Yugoslavia during the whole thing.  He exploited Serbian nationalism and used it to legitimize everything.  He was never convicted of any crimes.  He died while on trial.  He was successful in defending himself against all accounts by the courts and was regarded largely as a failure of the courts to convict him.

Where it gets interesting is when the names come from cultures that the names are closely linked to where the people are from and what their religious background is.

However, you are being misinformed on a couple of things. 

The first point is that champion rates are 70% silver and bronze. No, they are not. You can pull your stats from those divisions, sure, but you also can avoid that. Hell, it is in champion.gg FAQ. It pulls data only form plat+ across NA, EU and KR regions. No low elo, only ""hyped"" regions. And you can manually filter data input on lolking. For example, donger is still in the positive winrates in dia+ tiers. Obviously, due to smaller data sample (donger is not popular at all), his winrate fluctuates. It was 58% on 25th, today it is 53%, but I don't see it falling below 50%.

Sleeper OP. Without any doubt, there are some champions that are ""not discovered"" yet. That does not make an argument good enough to state that ALL low winrate champions have the potential, ESPECIALLY when buffs and nerfs are in place. And THEN what you got wrong is that ""pro made Janna a monster"". He did not do shit to her power, he only boosted her popularity. Janna was good when support items were introduced. She was so good, that she sported the highest winrate in high soloQ at that time. If you really want, you can dig reddit threads discussing those item iterations, and look for mentions of that wind bitch. You'll see Janna mains. Yes, people have kind of forgotten about her, true, but this video is called ""winrates are bullshit"" not ""pickrates are bullshit"".

Winrates do not form randomly. There is a reason behind them, and when they CHANGE there is a reason behind that as well. Of course you have to analyze win rate form high elo paired with pick rate, because, for example, **the higher pickrate the lower winrate**. If a champion gains popularity (without any nerfs and buffs) his winrate **inevitably drops**.

1. High win rate low pick rate. A strong pocket pick, people don't know how to play against him, while only people who know this champion pick him. Either someone will beat the shit out of LCS enemies and popularize this shit, or there is some strong counter-play, and it will never see competitive play, remaining the pub-stomper forever.
2. Low win rate low pick rate. Everyone thinks this champ is shit, and no one has figured how to make this champion does not suck. If someone does figure out this shit, it is going to transition to state 1.
3. High win rate, high pick rate (or, rather high ban rate). This champ would have got 60%+ winrate if not for the bandwagoners that ruin his stat. OP stuff right here.
4. Low win rate, high pick rate. Either this champ has been nerfed recently, or it is the ""porn idol"". If it's the former, the fotm crowd will leave soon and the champ will revert to state 1 or state 2. If it's the latter, then it's exactly the case of people playing it because they think it is fun, even if they suck.

So, it doesn't matter if everything will settle down after 5 or 10 yeats, nothing will change unless it's a revolution in Russia. Lithuania would still pay the most for the gas as they already did and no on would care. You can have your own opinion about Russias threat to Europe, however this is a different topic, there is a reason for this decision and this process is a result of 20 year conflict beteen Lithuania and Russia.

As I said, a long time ago I posted a link to a site which is frequented by immigrants. The overwhelming attitude on that site was that Kiwis are unfriendly, xenophobic and racist.  In the replies I got from kiwis a clear majority said that yes Kiwis were unfriendly and racist but that it wasn't a big deal.

&gt;This shows an abysmal understanding of culture. Kiwi culture is a melting pot of Maori and NZ European culture, and more recently some 2nd/3rd gen ""immigrant"" culture.

Bullshit.  There is no kiwi culture. There is maori culture, there is english culture. The english came here, killed a bunch of Maori, took their land, and stole aspects of their culture in order to promote tourism.  I tell you what. I have never ever heard any Pakeha New Zealander say a nice word about Maoris. Ever. Every conversation that includes the Maori is filled with negative words.

&gt;Now, I actually could name you 5 things of Kiwi culture which derive specifically from NZ European culture if you wanted (although that already misses the point).

LOL. ""Derived from european culture"". It's just European culture, not even European, just English.

&gt;No it isn't. I was asking a genuine logical question, which NZ-bashers never answer.

I'll answer it for you.  It's not your country you racist cunt. The country just doesn't belong to you, it belongs to every legal resident including the ones you want to kick out.  They have every right to try and shape this country the way they want it just as you do.

Fuck you and your xenophobic, racist brethren.   I am going to fight you, I am going to organize with people who think like me, and I am betting my side is going to win.

---

&gt;The name *Altair* has been used since medieval times. It is an abbreviation of the [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language) phrase النسر الطائر, *an-nasr aṭ-ṭā’ir* (English: The flying eagle). The term __Al Nesr Al Tair__ appeared in [Al Achsasi al Mouakket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Achsasi_al_Mouakket)'s catalogue, which was translated into [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) as __Vultur Volans__.  This name was applied by the Arabs to the [asterism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(astronomy\)) of α, [β](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Aquilae), and [γ Aquilae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_Aquilae) and probably goes back to the ancient Babylonians and Sumerians, who called α Aquilae the eagle star.  The spelling *Atair* has also been used.  Medieval [astrolabes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe) of England and Western Europe depicted Altair and Vega as birds.

&gt;___Prunus cerasus___ (__sour [cherry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry)__, __tart cherry__, __dwarf cherry__,  or __wild cherry__) is a species of *[Prunus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prunus)* in the subgenus *[Cerasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry)* ([cherries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry)), native to much of [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) and southwest [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia). It is closely related to the sweet cherry (*[Prunus avium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prunus_avium)*), but has a [fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit) that is more [acidic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid), has greater nutritional benefits,  and may have greater medicinal effects.   The nutritional differences between the sweet and the tart or sour cherries are displayed at the [general page for the fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry#Nutritional_value).

Hay muchas cosas que son factor español.
No obstante algunas, en mi ignorancia, considero que es factor humano.

Con el tiempo he aprendido a diferenciar bien entre ambos factores.
Como premio de consolación comentarte que cada país tiene su ""factor"" e incluso otras culturas tienen otros factores. España por ejemplo tiene el factor Europeo y el factor Español. 

Este tema es un precioso debate. Pero no creo que la plataforma de debate sea plaza, aunque si un punto de inicio y de encuentro.

Analfabetismo cultural
Es decir, gracias a Dios en España no hay analfabetismo. Si hay todavía analfabetismo tecnológico y mucho analfabetismo cultural.
Que es el analfabetismo cultural? 
Es el desconocimiento por inmersión de otra cultura. 
Es decir, es un concepto aceptado que hay culturas diferentes y hoy en día nadie discute que cada cultura extructura el pensamiento de una forma distinta.
Eso enriquece el panorama cultural, pues dos personas pueden acabar pensando que le gusta la democracia, pero llegan a esa conclusión por caminos diferentes. 
No por opiniones diferentes, sino por mecanismos diferentes. 
Una cosa es entenderlo, otra comprenderlo, y otra haberlo experimentado.
Este último paso es el más complicado de conseguir porque hay que vivir en el sitio, hay su sumergirse en esa cultura, estar muy receptivo y empezar a pensar, sentir y vivir como si hubieses nacido allí.
Eso enriquece tu cerebro porque se despiertan otros canales y conexiones neuronales. 
No obstante, España es un país rico en paisajes y personajes. 
En concreto, el factor europeo, español, gallego por poner un ejemplo, es un FACTOR muy fácil de comprender y de diferenciar con el de Sevilla.
Pero tu te estás perdiendo una parte importante del mundo y son las diferencias por ejemplo entre factor Europeo, Chino o Euroasiático. 

Digo que te estás perdiendo porque de tu texto se desprende la gran sensibilidad que tienes para percibir estos matices y como solo hay una vida ... me da lástima que te mueras sin haber visto estos paisajes que te trato de describir y que bajo mi óptica, son imprescindibles para cualquier persona y mucho más para cualquier político que quiera desarrollar sus funciones en el panorama internacional.

Fascist or democratic doesn't mean a thing since both systems have been responsible for atrocities. I accept that the world is governed by nature which is made up of both genetics and environment. 

I am not interested in special interest groups because they are made up of loud, obnoxious minority groups who are way better off than they could and should be. I believe in the live-and-let-live mentality however people should recognize that majority rules.

I believe that society has a cancer that is purposely placed in order to destroy the strength of the majority and remove all voting and social power from the majority (white Europeans). This majority created a paradise under many forms of government including capitalism in the United States before it was completely corrupted and in Germany under Fascism before it was destroyed by the communist/zionist invasion of Europe. This Western majority has been responsible for the greatest achievements in human history and is being punished for being successful.

Politically speaking, I am for the nationalism of white people and for the nationalism of their resources and borders. I believe that corrupt, corporate practices under Hebrew Capitalism has destroyed not only the land but the people and has destroyed any kind of democracy or nationalism that might exist. I believe that the majority has been polarized towards sanitation and perversion, under foreign influence, while completely ignoring the right to self-determination. I don't believe that any system of government will work while this is occurring. 

The form of government means very little in comparison to a strong, national voting pool and a community-centric society. We can not have this until integration is removed. People should not be forced together because this eliminates their community power. This is why border changes and population integration is so prevalent in the global scheme of things. By reducing identity as a group and making individuals their own islands, they produce a powerless and unorganized population with diverging ideas and causes. The results of cultural Marxism have been the destruction of the family unit, the end of common decency and the institution of individuality at the cost of freedom, economic power and political power.
The right vs left issue has been played by controlling interests to divide people in areas that do not matter and to distract from matters that are important. It really doesn't matter, politically, if you are a liberal or a conservative, because both sides are being directed by Hebrew Capitalism. 

The real political issues are: 

Why are populations of different people being forced to co-exist?

Why are we trying to maintain a mixed system of capitalism, fascism, democracy and nationalism when none of them are making a difference because none of them are able to utilize their strengths when all of them are vying for position?

Why are minority groups being allowed to control the political, social, media and cultural aspects of a society?

Why is the majority paying for the mistakes and opportunities of minority groups?

Why are we allowing big businesses to dictate what charities are acceptable?

Why is political correctness and cultural Marxism being taught?

Why is the majority being bullied into a submissive state?

Why are our governments being sponsored by outside/private forces when the majority could vote for a national system that would represent them?

People complain about non-representation and then they play into the special interest game and become divided. Minority issues are not issues. Getting people to stop calling gay people fags isn't helping anyone. Stopping people from saying women belong in the kitchen doesn't do anything. These issues are not important and anything that is should be defined by common law and rights and freedoms. Which they already are. Majority issues are important. They determine a quality of life for everyone, including minorities.

so, I'll get started but if I lose interest in it half way through dont blame me.

&gt;Of course imams who are educated in Turkey are influenced by Turkish politics. What's your point and what do you mean by ""*he fears for his countries influence over turks that emigrated to austria*""?

I get that you are confused because you lack insight in the situation, but if you dont know anything, why get involved? that would be my first question. and here is my answer: the law requires that all mosques be financed independently from other countries and that new imams be educated in austria. to have austrian imams with austrian socialisation for austrian muslims. not turkish imams with 3 week crash courses in austrian society and legal system. and **thats** what irks Erdogan in truth.

o god I lose interest already in answering you, but I will try to adress a few more points.

&gt; It wouldn't be in breach of Dutch or Turkish laws and regulations.

it is a breach of austrian regulations. we do only in very rare occurances grant double citizenship. since turks **want** austrian citizenship they are **informed** beforehand that this will mean they have to lose their old one. they are aware of the legal code of austria. they sign up to it. then they turn around and betray it right away. the broader public was not aware that there were that many cases of this outrageous behaviour before quite recently. awareness is groing, and the austrian government will soon need to come down hard on this. or right wingers will laugh their asses off all the way to the chancellory. the government of austria has wronged its people by being to soft on this issue. but the turks that did it knowingly lied and tricked the system. not a good start if you really  want to become a part of it. 

&gt;Changing the narrative in order to suit your own narrative makes you lose credibility. 

I did not change the narrative. you just lack sufficient insight in the situation to actually understand what its about. let me help you: 

&gt;That's called a state visit

it is not. and it was not a state visit, which is an affront to austria to begin with. he came as ""private person"" to hold a campaign rally. with immigrants and turks that cheated the system. the government explicitly said it did not want him to bring turkish politics into **our country**, but he did anyway. he then proceeded to tell the turks to remain turkish and that they were heirs to a faggot that tried to conquer austria.

**is that in any way acceptable behaviour of a sitting president in your eyes?**
furthermore austrian journalists in austria were harassed in the meeting and rally because this was only ""for turkish ears and eyes"". IN OUR OWN COUNTRY. if that seems in any way excusable to you, you must be a turk. oh wait... in any case, its the opposite of conducive to harmony between ethnic groups. 

&gt;Rally with ""immigrants"" is actually what is offensive here

do you uphold that comment? because they are a) immigrants - otherwise they would not have the right to vote in turkey, and thats why Erdogan came. and secondly, after all the affronts against this nation and state that his visit and speech and conduct gave... THAT is insulting to you? you need a reality check. this is Vienna, not Istanbul. 

&gt;There are Austrian born Turks. There are Austrians who have given away their dual citizenship. 

all of whom are not targeted by Erdogan because they cant vote for him. again, you dont actually know what you are talking about. you are just pissed because someone said something about your people and its president. 

&gt;There are also Austrians and foreigners who attend these rallies who have nothing to do with Turkey or being a Turk.

yes, they are called journalists and they were harassed. see comment above. in ANY case, it is unacceptable that a turkish president campaigns in austria for a turkish vote. Its is respectless to say the least, and the ""we do what we want"" attitude in which he did it seriously did a lot to hurt the rep of your people. 

&gt;Referring to them all as ""immigrants"" is another example of you having no credibility and you twisting the narrative in order to suit your own views.

stop embarassing yourself. it was organised by a turkish organisation in austria with ties to erdogan, specifically targeted via invite lists at turks in austria who could vote for him in turkey. it was turkish-nationalism week in the heart of europe, and he did it against the wishes of our government. AND non turks were being harassed at it. if anyone is trying to change the narrative, its **you**. and I think we all know why. now stop embarassing yourself with your half-knowledge about austrian affairs. 

&gt;It's offensive to refer to history? Ever heard of the Battle of Vienna and the Siege of Vienna? He's referring to actual historical facts

**it is very offensive to refer to history the way he did it**. he spoke in AUSTRIA to TURKS, some of which held AUSTRIAN citizenship and called them heirs to a man that besieged VIENNA and killed many many people in the process - while IN VIENNA against the will of our state! not to speak of enslavement turks did. and if you think it is in any way not offensive or accepable or even excusable, this discussion is over because you are unfit to critically reflect the behaviour of turkish people.

&gt;You're also ripping things out of context.

I dont. but maybe I didnt get the whole picture because the rally in austria was for turkish ears and eyes only. what a joke.

&gt; He did's hold a speech in which he claimed that they were the heirs of these Turks and that they therefore should march and conquer Vienna.

yeah, you lost coherence there. unintelligible.  and stop educating me on austrian history, learn you own. 

&gt;The only offensive thing here is that you resort to lies in order to label him as something he's not.

that is a good point to recap on your failed post: I have shown that you have no idea what you are talking about, no insight into the situation, no real knowledge of what went down but that you will stick to your man because... well, not because he did no wrong. why? because hes muslim? or your president? either way, the facts and truth are on my side, and you should be ashamed of yourself.

&gt;Because of stuff like what? What are you even saying? You can't write a jibberish rant and then conclude that you've just shown why [insert your claim]. Logic much?

jibberish rant? you know, just because you dont understand what someone is talking about does not mean its jibberish. in your case it means that you are clueless about the situation and facts. 

and whats with the Kurz quote? are you trying to tell me something? because he is right and I agree with him.

Psygnosis was a big UK-based publisher that eventually became a part of Sony. Codemasters was huge for many years. In France, Infogrames was absolutely massive, at one point gobbling up US franchises and studios left and right (it used to own Sid Meier's Civilization, Unreal, Oddworld, and many other IPs, and acquired US publishers GT Interactive and Hasbro and devs like Shiny Entertainment). Eidos was another publishing powerhouse and was based in the UK... it was the company behind Tomb Raider, Hitman, Deus Ex and more, though it was eventually acquired by Square Enix.

So I think your theories don't hold up. There were actually a lot of ""early birds"" in Europe, and market and cultural fragmentation didn't stop European publishers from becoming enormously succesful in Europe and internationally. I think the relative decline of Europe in terms of game publishing is simply due to individual business reasons, i.e. different companies seeing a decline for different reasons (or becoming eventually acquired by Japanese or US companies).

I was writing that under the presumption that it was obvious and I apologise for not explaining it further.

Here I go.

My sources will be primarily from http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/100-percent-renewable-electricity.pdf

and 

http://www.withouthotair.com which was written by Professor David McKay who is the governments advisor on renewables.

First of all he states that as a calculation we use approximately 195 kWh per day per person if we spread the entirety of the UK's energy usage across every person within the UK. However he calculates the energy usage of every single renewable technology that the UK can use and we get 180 kWh per day per person. Wow you may think that's pretty close, it could actually be doable... But.. This is a huge but and even he states the case. 

&gt;in calculating our production stack we threw all economic,
social, and environmental constraints to the wind. Also, some of our green
contributors are probably incompatible with each other: our photovoltaic
panels and hot-water panels would clash with each other on roofs; and our
solar photovoltaic farms using 5% of the country might compete with the
energy crops with which we covered 75% of the country. If we were to lose
just one of our bigger green contributors – for example, if we decided that
deep offshore wind is not an option, or that panelling 5% of the country
with photovoltaics at a cost of £200 000 per person is not on – then the
production stack would no longer match the consumption stack.

How about this then?

&gt;Sometimes people ask me “surely we used to live on renewables just fine,
before the Industrial Revolution?” Yes, but don’t forget that two things
were different then: lifestyles, and population densities.
Turning the clock back more than 400 years, Europe lived almost en-
tirely on sustainable sources: mainly wood and crops, augmented by a little
wind power, tidal power, and water power. It’s been estimated that the
average person’s lifestyle consumed a power of 20 kWh per day. The wood
used per person was 4 kg per day, which required 1 hectare (10 000 m2) of
forest per person. The area of land per person in Europe in the 1700s was
52 000 m2. In the regions with highest population density, the area per per-
son was 17 500 m2 of arable land, pastures, and woods. Today the area of
Britain per person is just 4000 m2, so even if we reverted to the lifestyle of
the Middle Ages and completely forested the country, we could no longer
live sustainably here. Our population density is far too high.

I for one don't want to go back to living like a medieval peasant and if you think it wouldn't happen to you... 

Installing just 33GW of offshore wind would need 10,000 square kilometres of coastal waters generating only 3% of our current energy supply, Professor MacKay estimates. Yeeeeeah, that's gonna happen.

PWC came up with an interesting roadmap for 100% renewables by centralising all power generation and distribution policy under centralised pan european and a pan african bodies so that energy trades can occur between northern and southern states. How likely is that plan? Honestly?

Also for another example with Nuclear which the Green party would throw out. 

&gt;Brown coal electricity production in Germany rose last year to its highest level since 1990, despite the country’s campaign to shift to green sources of energy.

&gt;The exchanges come as chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition looks to revise Germany’s energy policies – maintaining commitments to green energy while also controlling the costs and protecting economic competitiveness. At the same time, Berlin is also grappling with an EU probe into subsidies paid to some industries to shield them from high energy prices.
The German figures could reverberate across the EU as discontent grows over the bloc’s energy policies. The continent’s biggest utilities, in particular, have lambasted Brussels for measures they say have hurt industry without delivering hoped-for environmental benefits.

&gt;Germany’s carbon dioxide emissions, which rose from 917m tonnes in 2011 to 931m tonnes in 2012, are estimated to show an increase of 20m tonnes when figures are tallied for last year.

All in all Coal ash residue from coal fire power stations is more radioactive, causes more CO2 to be released and is significantly less green.

The total amount of investment required, versus what we are willing to pay for in addition to nimbyism shows that the UK categorically cannot be 100% renewable without nuclear. ",-3.88 -5.95 Ummm... ????,cp0ucbp,False,0,False,1427518650,t1_cp0rsu9,0,ukpolitics,,t1_cp0ucbp,1425222943,t5_2qhcv,,0

We ended up doing 1.5 months in India, then decided that as amazing as the country is, we wanted to get out and do something else. So we went to Korea for 2 weeks. Then we went to Japan for 2 months. Then we went to Turkey, then ... and as luck (or poor planning) would have it, we find ourselves here in Italy in February. 

It's been a bit of a bummer to miss some places (like Amalfi, and here!) in the summer because I LOVE spearfishing/diving/swimming and these are awesome places to enjoy the water, but there are a lot of other places that honestly I'm happy to have had nice, cool, relatively tourist free times. 

I don't think I'd recommend coming to Western Europe in the winter for most people, but honestly it hasn't been ""bad"" - just a bit colder (and lonelier ;))

edit: I may not have been clear. Basically, we ended up here because we didn't have a plan at any point, and we ended up spending summer in India and each step of our trip we didn't think far enough ahead to consider where we would spend winter.

0,MrTubes,2,False,t3_2xevrd,"&gt; Nuclear plants, when they're running, run at 100%, so I don't see how one plant can back up another.

They actually do, even when running at 100%, on a short time scale. When the interconnect frequency drops, all synchronous generators (nuclear, fossil, hydro, biomass) will increase their output to arrest the frequency decline. In a few seconds their governors will kick in and bring their output back down, but they've actively helped keep the power system stable in a way wind turbines typically don't.

I say typically because there has been talk of emulating this response in wind turbines. It requires the wind units operate below what they could based on wind conditions to allow them to dynamically increase their output. This may have been implemented in places in Europe (e.g. Germany, Denmark), and to my knowledge it has only been discussed in the US.

I often see people comment that wind is surplus in one region while down in another, but I've yet to see hard data showing this in practice and how it would be implemented. I routinely see the [MISO wind data](https://www.misoenergy.org/MarketsOperations/RealTimeMarketData/Pages/RealTimeWindGeneration.aspx) drop, despite MISO covering a very large, diverse area (Iowa, Minnesota, Indiana, all with significant wind resources).

0,[deleted],1,1425226387,t3_2vdq0d,"I would strongly discourage you from moving to Bratislava. I was born in Bratislava and I have also lived in Vienna and a couple of other Western European cities. Bratislava is a nice town, but there's nothing that makes Bratislava preferable over Western Europe... except the beautiful women. 99% of the foreigners who move to Slovakia from Western Europe are young men who fell in love with a beautiful Slovak woman. You already have a wife, so there's literally no reason for you to move to Slovakia. Come here as a tourist, but don't move here.

People on this thread who are saying that Bratislava is super cheap are wrong. These people obviously have high-paying jobs, and those jobs are rare. Even though Bratislava is the richest part of Slovakia, the standards of living in Bratislava are significantly lower than in Western Europe and there are less job opportunities. Bratislava and Vienna are just 40 miles from each other, but the difference in living standards is very significant. It's like a middle class suburb in the Midwest vs a small town in rural Alabama.

As a native speaker of English, you can teach English, but that's pretty much it. You could also find a job at an international company. You'd be doing mind-numbing work (outsourced from the US or the UK) for €750-€900 per month after taxes. However, those kind of jobs are currently being outsourced from Eastern Europe to India. International companies in Slovakia are mostly looking for people who speak German, French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish. English alone won't get you anywhere, it's just a prerequisite for getting a job. The fact that you're a native speaker won't give you a leg up at those companies. 

You say you ""could probably do anything if I really wanted to."" You could do a lot of things in Slovakia, but you'd be competing in a small and relatively poor market against people who are native speakers. You'd have to speak perfect Slovak first. I'm not saying it's not doable, but why take the most difficult road? If you want to move to Europe, move to Germany.

0,K-zi,3,False,t3_2xjr4q,"&gt;We say that the extremists don't represent the views of all Muslims,but a pew poll stated that 70% of Pakistanis and 86% of Jordanians(for example) support the death penalty for apostasy. No criticism of the religion is socially acceptable, because it is either shot down as "" racism"" or because the muslims go full retard on us.

Statistics are very objective but how you interpret them is not. The same pew research asked people how many times they prayed, read the quran and engaged in islamic conversations.The results across the globe show people are not devoted as we thought. They don't pray 5 times, in fact, 1-3 times a week is the mean (if I remember correctly), very few read the quran and even fewer read it in a language they understand. So even though they say yeah, we want sharia, they probably don't care much and aren't willing to do anything to enforce the law. So why do they say yes? Because saying no would look unislamic. 
&gt;If Christianity or Hinduism can be mocked why not Islam? I think that the Muslim Birth rate is an alarming issue, and is the only reason for it being the ""fastest growing religion"". Islam is the only religion which results in Thousands of people protesting over a cartoon(Chechnya,London,Pakistan).

You have a very short memory of world history and that too is biased. Go back in history, you will find atrocities committed by every religion in existence. Google hinduism and violence, you will be surprised. 

&gt;They protest as a united front over Israels actions in Palestine, but don't present the same united front condemning ISIS,Saudi, Syria etc. They also plead with us to think about the ""human rights"" of Palestinians. What about the human rights of the people THEY have displaced and Enslaved? 

First of all they do protest. Second, they are busy saving their asses. Whenever something like this happens muslims go on the defense and embark on this mission to tell people, they are not terrorists and that takes their time and resources off protesting against ISIS. Also, you might see that blacks are very involved in the civil rights of blacks, LGBT are involved in their own rights. There isn't too much of an overlap because everyone is self motivated and are concerned with what effects them the most. So muslims are involved in what concerns them, saving their image. 

&gt;They also plead with us to think about the ""human rights"" of Palestinians. What about the human rights of the people THEY have displaced and Enslaved? (Kashmiri Pandits, Mauritiana). They cite international law to bring forward their case, but what about them following international law when it comes to freedom of speech, freedom of religion etc.

Two wrongs don't make a right.

&gt; If Islam is not the root cause of terror, why don't we see people of similar backgrounds in militant extremism?(Arab Chrisitians, Or Tibetan Buddhists harming Chinese people).

Because you are not looking.

&gt;It's also Preposterous that the OIC make up their own ""sharia compliant human rights"" and give us the finger. They talk about the Islamic golden age and how christianity was barbaric a thousand years ago, why don't they talk about the tolerance they extend to non monotheists?(again, Hindus) or how christianity has reformed, or that we don't live in the 10th century? They constantly say ""don't blame us for the acts of a few"" but they go full Halal on innocent European Jews(hypocrisy much).

&gt;The solution to this cancer is in the islamic texts itself, and i think they should be exposed to their atrocities similar to how german civilians were(Bengal Genocide, public stoning of adulterers etc) to remove them of their pride. CMV

---

&gt;__Continental philosophy__ is a set of 19th- and 20th-century philosophical traditions from [mainland Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe).   This sense of the term originated among English-speaking philosophers in the second half of the 20th century, who used it to refer to a range of thinkers and traditions outside the [analytic movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy). Continental philosophy includes the following movements: [German idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_idealism), [phenomenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy\)), [existentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism) (and its antecedents, such as the thought of [Kierkegaard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard) and [Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche)), [hermeneutics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics), [structuralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism), [post-structuralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralism), [French feminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism_in_France), [psychoanalytic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalytic_theory), and the [critical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory) of the [Frankfurt School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School) and related branches of [Western Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Marxism).

Nor can they punish Spain or Italy who will also stop paying and stay in the EU. 

Remember Greek, Spanish, and Italian banks can create euros.  Its not like the EU can stop these countries from borrowing after they default.  Normally your exchange rate goes against you, but their currency is the euro. 

They can default and the next day borrow from their own banks as many euros as they want.

That being said, you've basically provided no historical proof besides piracy which isn't even a mechanic around here as to why I couldn't bring southern Indian vassals to build warships in northeastern India using western hull shapes with swiss swivel guns and cannons (which are basically non mounted larger smoothbore swivel guns anyway) I'll add appropriate time constraints and construction costs. But I continue to differ, you don't need detailed blueprints to build a European style hull which is almost the same compared to the Chola fleet I currently have at my disposal anyway, this isn't a modern steam boat that requires complex engine blueprints, this a boat that moves with oars and sails that really only requires constant checking to make sure it stays upright and buoyant in the water.

I'm 25 years old. 
After a massive heart attack at 21 I ended up with more hospital debt then I can ever imagine...the great news is a path opened up. I saw how fake college has become, how collapsing the natural resources are, and how so many wars all over the world are taking place. I adapted my life to travel and see the world instead of waiting.

I'm a bartender, but a traveling one, who also is a free lance and very avid fly fishing writer. I follow tourist destinations, spring break, Colorado ski resorts, national parks in the summer, etc. In turn I make great money for my age, I'd say average 50-60k. But I get around 3 months off in between seasons. So I travel the world....south America, Europe, Russia, eastern Europe. I won't stop, I can't stop, until I have seen and fished every inch of the planet. I have a ticking time bomb in my chest which drives me to work so hard, save so diligently and leaves me no time at all. 

If anyone in the world needs a teacher it's probably me. I'll admit my studies have been hard, I've read over 20+ Buddhism books, 're read them, got note books and made detailed notes of them and still I just can't get meditation fully down.  My anxiety is so bad sometimes sitting is almost painful. But at the same time I've progressed in a way of mindfulness that I catch so many thoughts, see them as they are, studied them with awareness and watch them drift away with a smile on my face. 

But honestly, it's 2015 and this is a dog eat dog world full of technology and a never ending machine eating 24-hours a day. I don't need to rant on here, I hope we all see it, kids 5 years old with ipads ipads ipads, the iphone15 gotta get it here's my money , consume consume consume etc etc. 

I wake up, around 1pm I write, I worry about how my book is selling, how my editor likes my new writing, if a publisher has picked me up, I should probably eat healthy today, I should workout, feed my temple and cherish it. I run my dog, I listen to democarynow to see what new scary things I should be tuned in too, I figure out some bills, my savings, getting up on chores, I try to sit, the next thing I know it's 6pm, gotta get to work, its a bar, everyone around me is drinking, already on drugs, it's spring break baby. 8pm 6000 people flood in the doors, I don't get a break, I don't think, I zone out, the next thing I know it's 4 am, the bar is shut down, I wander home, cook, drink a beer, and pass out to do it again. If I get a day off, I'm on the water. The only thing that keeps me grounded is fly fishing. I'll wake up at sunrise, and fish until the sun sets, on the rare nights off I retreat to my happy place, insents, low lighting, Buddhist music, and I tie flies, I write, and I study...

I say I hate working stressful bars, but the money fuels my passion. After a month I collect my. 15 grand. I get on a plane, and for the next month or two I travel and see, meet and touch people from all corners of the world, never touching a phone, or internet. 

This subreddit saves me. Say what you will but my plead to people reading your post is if this is your only connection to like minded thinkers then please use it. It has helped me so much along the way. Its the average Joe, to know there are people struggling like me also. I would love a teacher, don't no the first step to finding the right one. So when I do log onto the internet, I find joy in this sudreddit, generally people are nice and helping, generally all the questions asked I have wondered. I know it can't replace a teacher but this IS my only direct source to the Buddhist world, and there are a lot of smart people who offer a lot of sound advice, or post beautiful little reminders and quotes. I can image posters like me. Maybe you have a family, kids, house payments, car payments, you work to much, but you provide and sacrifice for your family and it leads you little time. Maybe you used to be like me, Buddhism teachings all over talk about how greedy the mind can be and how easily America has conditioned the mind to fast food, video games, tv, Netflixs, government checks...and the doctors turn to pills, or you find bliss in marijuana. I've been there. But please don't stop posting, don't stop trying to search out advice, the movement of ideas is what makes human greats. If you have access or time to a teacher I'm jealous brother, but if not, seeing your posts, seeing your struggles, makes me no I'm not ALONE and that key fact keeps my anxiety at bay. And the willingness of everyone trying to help is so beautiful here...

People seem to forget that we absolutely blasted expectations, playing wonderful football. 

This year there has been a clear fitness issue, and an issue with European hangovers- but this is a highly competitive league with a staff that is relatively inexperienced in the challenge that has been presented to us this year.  

We have seen huge development this year, both from individuals (Besic, Stones, Naismith and Lukaku especially) and even as a team. Whilst it doesn't click all the time, we have shown that we have the ability to really mix up tempo over the last 6 weeks or so. 

Next year, without those nightmare Thursdays- and a number of new players in the side, I feel we will once again be back as a comfortable top half side. 

Whilst I may be wrong, I see a hell of a lot of positives within our play. Whilst we are doing some things poorly, and are perhaps putting too much emphasis on developing youth (playing Barkley and Lukaku week in week our for one), I think it is a strategy that will pay off in years to come.

My general observations:

- You are much better of taking stuff from USA and selling elsewhere.  I've done it and made great money.  As a tourist, you can take stuff in pretending it's your own and avoiding any duties and import taxes - and that's assuming you're one of the 1% that customs searches.  If they search you, you just tell them it's yours and they can't do much about it.  

For example, Sony Playstation costs $400 in the USA.  [But in Brasil, it costs $1850.](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/10/22/239860325/sony-explains-why-its-playstation-4-costs-1-845-in-brazil)  Surely you can figure out how to make some nice money by putting one in your backpack on your trip to Brasil.  A lot of stuff is like this and it's a combination of (1) ridiculous protectionist import duties, (2) smaller market where higher margins are required because volume is smaller, and (3) general unavailability because a product doesn't have distribution in that country or distribution is delayed.  A lot of small hot electronics make for good candidates to do this. This is a novel concepts for many Americans, but Europeans do this all the time, actually.

- When you see some carvings and scarves in some market in India or Zambia, it looks really cool and novel to you.  You have probably never seen it before and prices seem reasonable.  But you mostly have this impression because you probably never tried looking for these scarves and carved figurines in the USA.  They're out there - TONS OF THEM.  I've looked up some of these items over the years and I could often find them cheaper in the USA than at an African roadside stall.  And this is at USA retail level, distributors are getting it even cheaper.  My 10 second Ebay search:  [4 African hardcarved figurines for $25.](http://www.ebay.com/itm/CARVED-AFRICAN-FIGURES-/121582335504?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item1c4edf3610)

That's lesson #2:  buy what you know, instead of buying random things that look new to you but you really have no idea what you're buying, what you should want in your product, whether there is demand in the USA, and what price you can sell it for in the USA.  Additionally, as /u/Roving_artist/ points out, a lot of these products are pushed to tourists at tourist attractions because people think they're getting something voluble when in reality they're getting something pretty worthless.  Tourist countries are full of ""gemstone"" schemes.  But unless you're an expert, you don't know if you're getting 100% saffron in Kashmir or high grade silk in Thailand.  

- China is the world's factory and other developing countries tend to be pretty damn inefficient.  When you go to India and other countries, you will still see ""Made in China"" label.  Countries like India have a lot of protectionist measures to keep their local industries going, but what does that mean to you?  It really just means that stuff in India is overpriced compared to stuff in China and India can't compete on the free market.  You can buy the same stuff from China, cheaper.

You can travel the world and go to markets and stores and *for items that you actually know* you will generally find higher prices than in the USA.  And lower quality, on top of that.  Go to any sneakers shop in Thailand and if the sneaker is genuine, it will sell for 30-70% more than in the USA.  And if you go to some low-end, individual trader night markets, you will - at best - find prices comparable to Target/Kmart/Walmart.  I've bought some cheap clothing abroad and it even though prices were similar to Target/Kmart/Walmart, the stuff turned out to be junk.  After a few washes, stitches would designate, fabric would fray, etc.  So you're getting Walmart prices but the good is actually far inferior to USA Walmart quality.  It's all made in China, but it's almost always more expensive across the border from China than it is in the USA, ironically enough.

So that's my tip to you:  know the prices for something in the USA, and good luck trying to find it cheaper elsewhere.  Stuff like trinkets/cosmetics/similar are basically novelty goods that sell based on how good of a salesman you are and how much marketing you do.  That's the major expense.  In itself, all that stuff is mostly worthless.  But if you're a really good marketer and can convince people that your stuff is really great, then the sky is the limit.  There is no real price for trinkets.  It comes down to your marketing.  Of course that also means that you can just buy this junk from Ebay for $5, and try to see how good of a marketer you are when you try to resell it for $50. Some people can do it.  Most people can't.

This is one of the most widely argued conspiracy theories of World War Two - and there is *some* truth to it. It is true Japan did not want to start a war with the US and UK, she knew she could not fight in both mainland China and against the European colonies in South East Asia. Does this mean the European empires intentionally attempted to provoke Japan into war via sanctions? Absolutely not. Sanctions against Japan began in 1939 in response to her terror bombing of Chinese cities. These economic sanctions incidentally included exporting materials used to build bombers. While the US, British and Dutch opposed Japan's aggression against China, there is *no evidence* that prior to 1941 they had any intention of intervening militarily. It was only after Japan invaded French Indochina in 1940, effectively expanding the Sino war to the rest of Asia, did the sanctions stiffen (an embargo on oil and freezing Japanese assets) and war become likely. Regardless of what Blakeney would have us believe - the sanctions were not part of some grand master plan to lure Japan into a war. They correlated with Japan's territorial expansion. 

Would the sanctions have inevitably lead to war? The US, British and Dutch claimed they would lift the sanctions off of Japan if she withdrew from China and French Indochina. In response army minister Tojo Hideki argued
&gt;The army's position is that there can be no compromise on the stationing of troops in China. It affects military morale. . . . Troop withdrawals are the heart of the matter. If we just acquiesce to the American demand, everything we have achieved in China will be lost. Manchukuo will be endangered and our control of Korea will also be jeopardized. (Ienaga, 1978, pp 134)

In one of the few occasions the Navy and Army agreed on an issue, Navy minister Shimada Shigetaro reiterated Tojo:
&gt;On the basis of what I learned as commander of the China squadron, if our forces are removed our businessmen will have great difficulty in continuing their operations. Their personal safety might be endangered. Furthermore, no matter what happens on the mainland, I will oppose the removal of our forces from Hainan Island. (Ienaga, 1978, pp 134)

There is a probable chance that had Japan withdrew from China and French Indochina the sanctions would have been lifted. This is illustrated by the British closure of the Burma Road (China's trade route with the West) in 1940 in an attempt to appease Japan. While the sanctions of 1941 were a huge factor in Japan's expansionism into SE Asia, they were not definitive and definitely did not cause Japan's aggression in China. Even so, as early as 1940 Japan had already drawn up plans for the seizure of the Dutch East Indies. The West's fear that Japan threatened the stability of SE Asia was not unfounded.

If the sanctions were a consequence of Japan's aggression in China, what caused Japan's aggression? There was rampant economic turmoil in Japan throughout the late 20s and early 30s. Trade with other powers fell dramatically and Japan felt that if she were to stay in such a weakened economic state she would be colonized like the rest of Asia. Following the example of the European powers, she believed being the colonizer was the only way to avoid being the colonized. This pro-imperialist mindset eventually accumulated into the Mukden Incident of 1931, in which officers of the Kwantung army - without directive from Tokyo - bombed their own railway and used it as a pretext to invade Manchuria. Blakeney however believes the Mukden Incident was caused, not by Japanese officers, but by “Western-backed warlords”. Such an interpretation has been refuted by none-other than the Yomiuri Shimbun – Japan's largest (and conservative) newspaper. The newspaper's year-long project concluded:
&gt;The main instigators of the incident were Kanji Ishihara and Seishiro Itagaki, staff officers of the Kwantung Army, a unit of the Imperial Japanese Army. Determined to conspire together to grab power and lead the country, they became the masterminds of the act of aggression into Manchuria (currently part of northeastern China) and literally dragged the nation into a series of wars. 

As the Mukden incident occurred eight years before any sanctions were brought against Japan, and if we interpret the incident as the starting point of aggression in China, we can see Japan's invasion Manchuria set events into motion. That is to say, had there been no Mukden Incident, war between China and Japan in 1937 would not have occurred. As such, Japan would have had no reason to invade Indochina in 1940 to cut off China's trade route with the West. No invasion of Indochina would have meant no oil embargo which would ultimately lead Japan to take war materials in the rest of SE Asia by force.

It's not a mainstream form of understanding history, or one that's compatible with modern historical method. Neither, it's worth pointing out, is Eurocentrism.

It's generally associated with counterreacting to 20th century imperialism and Eurocentrism in general. As with many counterreactions, it goes way too far the other way. What's just as wrong about it, and more saddening, is how much it concedes the basis of the argument- the idea that in order to prove that African history is valuable, you have to prove that there is a checklist of things that people from Africa were involved in or achieved before anybody else.

The issue with the argument our friend was making June 2013, and is making all over again in this thread, is that their way of arguing with Afrocentrism is both stupid and gross- the idea of comparing Holocaust Denialism to Afrocentrism was not a prior topic in the thread in AskHistorians, but one they themselves introduced, and as I've pointed out elsewhere it's a ridiculous comparison to make.

There are also plenty of other things that would need replacement domestic funding.*

&gt;*Leaving the EU does close a lot of the corrupt administration loops that cost money and serve little value, but there's one other urgent consideration. Immigration. Ukip does like to bang on about immigration as though that we were the only country it affects. Not so. If Cameron ever does go to Europe to renegotiate on immigration issues, as EUreferendum puts it, he'd be ""kicking at an open door"".

FA is an European based A3 community, that takes pride in it's ''no-frills'' approach. FA doesn't require you to have mods or you to attend every session. But there are some optional mods that benefit you, like SThud.

Sessions are ran on Sundays and Tuesdays at 19.20 UK time. And in our sessions we run 4 or 5 missions, that are mainly infantry based and they last ~30 minutes each, so if you miss the start, you can still jump in the next mission, or if you want to call it a day earlier, there are no obligations to stay for all the missions.

What's more, we are all equal, if you decide to take a leadership role, go ahead, if you just want to be a ground-pounder, then be my guest, before each mission we have a slotting phase when we decide who will be who and after that there is the briefing, where the commander will decide how will we approach the mission. We like to play organized, not lone-wolfing through the thing. And if you don't know something, just ask, people will be happy to explain.

I'm French so I don't think we'll ever agree on this. We have a different tradition of secularism (our beloved *laïcité*), where the State should stay as far as possible from religion and not recognize any cult or religion (for example, the German religion tax would be viewed as terribly wrong here). Even though we've been discrimnatory against Islam (forbidding niqabs in public, right-wingers were very loud about Muslims praying in the street), I do believe that, provided all religions are treated equally in the law and its application (which is not currently the case), that it is what will work for my country. Maybe a Muslim Party (similar to (good) Christian Democrat parties) could be a good lobbing force, but I certainly wouldn't want them at the head of the State (just like Christian Democrats, who are really terrible in France).

We kicked out the *curés* from the State in 1905 and I don't want them back, in any way, shape or form. I'm not saying that we can't benefit from Islam; but laws shouldn't be religious, and every benefit that we get from Islamic thinkers (and some of them are great, check out Abdennour Bidar if you speak French) should not solely cater to Muslims (or Christians or Jews of course).

&gt;The fear of Islamism IS islamophobia 

I disagree. Part of my family is Muslim, some of them very devout, living in Morrocco and they hate Islamists and all kinds of fundamentalists ; according to my uncle, this kind of people is more feared there than in Europe. My cousin is a feminist and she really wants more secularism (having to cover up because men view women as objects is *not* nice, but this is what fundamentalists believe).",beep boop,cp10bsr,False,0,False,1427521831,t1_cp0yvow,1,ShitRedditSays,flair,t1_cp10bsr,1425235293,t5_2s4m9,,0

Edit: Made my comment before reading the article. Sorry for the redundant point of view. 

 &gt; In order to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act (in the US) and Disability Discrimination Act (in Britain and Australia), buildings must provide a wheelchair-accessible entrance. For some older buildings with limited space, this can be a rather tall order. 

&gt; The hidden chair lift can help preserve the integrity of historic buildings’ appearances and architecture while providing the necessary access for wheelchair users.

&gt; The ingenious chair lifts are tailor made for each building, so even buildings with extremely narrow entrances or historic façades can comply with the law without making major alterations.

I think to understand the differences you need a lot more cultural and historical perspective. As a young country the USA lacks a strong national indentity compared to a lot of European nations. Thus, when they visit another country they only look at the surface. 

Here's one example of a massive factor in deciding cultural differences; historical rivalries and alliances.

On the other hand, the US only fought inside itself once to my knowledge (the civil war?). In every single other war the US has fought together as one unit, always united.

0,Roywocket,1,1425241902,t3_2xcpiq,"&gt;You put awful lot of faith into MW, this is a book-selling company. The webpage offers lots of definitons, also similar definitions ( you noticed it has 4 different notions there under the irony webpage, just irony, socratic irony and two else). Socratic irony is a different type of irony then just irony (as a literary device). What you're doing is comparable to saying that the definition of literal narrative is good enough to describe oral narrative. Yes, both narratives, but both are distinctive things. Not to mention movie narrative, comic narrative etc etc etc. All different and all different definitions, even if all are narratives.
&gt;But ok, let's use some actually academic sources then. Cambride dictionary Oxford dictionary Macmillan dictionary

&gt;And now about the Socratic irony. The termirony is from 18th century, so not that old. This doesn't mean peopel didn't use thatknd of figurative speech before, it jsut means that as a term was invented then. It comes from ancient greece word eironeia (or εἰρωνεία if you care about the correct script), which translates into ""feigned ingorance"". And that is how the Socrates method was called in Platons texts about Socrates talks. You have to understand the ancient greece philosophers didn't think ""aw yes, I was totally ironic to that dude"". Irony is term of 18th century. No, what they thought was quite literal - I feigned ignorance to point out problems in their opponents logic. A rhetoric trap, if you will. And then the term irony was named so as a respectful nod (heh heh) to the classical european text on rhetorics.

&gt;The Merriam Webster dictionary just lumped several different definitions together. Look up any decent dictionaries (like above) or just get a textbook on poetics. I read the textbook on poetics in high school, where irony was clearly defined as I did before. In courses on poetic analysis in uni the same thing was reinforced. Yes the history of the name of the definiton was also introduced. &gt;

&gt;But we weren't talkin about the etymology of the word iront now, were we? We were talking about the definition. And definition is that, plain and simple.

Yeah and the definition I made clear was Socratic. And you didn't pick up on it. 

Also Merriam Webster is perfectly valid in definition here. But hey since it doesn't agree with you, then you have to reject it. 

And you just cannot help yourself being a patronizing douche. You feel the need to tell me what Socratic Irony is when I clearly already defined it for you. You failed to get the entire point of the excise even thou I literally told it to you. The patronizing bullshit is what let me to reflect the behavior back at you. In an effort to show you how your copy-pasting of common knowledge and talking down to people is insulting. But hey even when I told you it seemed to fly over your head. Guess you should really work on your reading skills (yeah I am still doing it) so you can comprehend what I am doing. Rather than it passes you buy. It is an excise in patronizing. You see to patronize means to talk down it. To treat with an apparent kindness which betrays a feeling of superiority. I could start going into its etymology, but it will be to much for you to handle.

You see I have access to the internet as well. And I can be a patronizing ass as well. And while it is good for my superiority complex it really only serves to make me look like an asshole. Kinda like what happens when you do it as well. No exactly what happens when you do it as well.

Are we done now? Have I made my point clear enough for you? Or do you insist on continuing this song and dance?

&gt;This isn't fun anymore. I see you have no real desire to actually discuss, but to batter your opponent into submission. All you do is try to find a way to paint your opponent into a corner. What would make you consider you actually have to change your view on things? Is it possible without hurting your ego?

Ah so we are back to the passive aggressive bullshit.

You could change my view by actually providing something of substance. Not vague appeals to ambiguity. Not factually false information. Not a genetic fallacy. 

Now would you kindly acknowledge that your accusation of cherrypicking was unfounded?

Would you kindly acknowledge that your genetic fallacy is bullshit?

When that is done feel free to actually argue the case. Provide something of substance rather than bullshit to make me change my position. Anything. You can refer to something I havn't dealt with (your ""Cherrypicking"" reasoning). However if I have dealt with it already you can apologize once again for your missunderstanding so you should probably check.

But since we are at it. Is there anything in existence that could make you change your mind? After all pointing out factually false information didn't change it. You have made no effort to actually ask me what I think GG is so you can deconstruct it or challenge it. If anything it is pretty clear to me that you have no intention of keeping this discussion honest.

Also, I have to drive for four hours, nearly 200 miles every time my university kicks people out of the dorms for holidays.

Any wizarding child who went to magic school or grew up with siblings knows the unique compulsion to cut a rug that is produced by Tarantallegra. But what many witches and wizards don't know is the creator of the spell caused an uproar in Strasbourg, Alsace in the early 16th century.

This is the story behind the Dancing Plague of 1518.

Danzer Freifoth was an Alsacian wizard who lived alone on the outskirts of Strasbourg. The International Wizarding Statute of Secrey was more than a hundred years away, and like many witches and wizards, Freifoth existed on the fringes of Muggle society. With no ban on intermingling with Muggles and Floo powder (a quicker, more accessible form of travel than the available broomsticks and apparition of the day) firmly established as part of magical culture for almost 3 centuries by this point, magical people spread across Europe and the 16th century saw the greatest interconnection between Muggles and Wizards since the days of ancient Egypt. 

Freifoth made his living as a herbologist, growing magical plants for potioneers throughout the Holy Roman Empire. However, Freifoth was also a passionate amateur spell-smith, the archaic name for those individuals who work to create new charms and enchantments. Spell creation is a dangerous business – even known spells can produce unfortunate results if performed incorrectly (as the archetypal Wizard Baruffio has been used for centuries to demonstrate). The process of crafting new spells is perilous and can be deadly to even an experienced experimental incantation fashioner; one wrong syllable, one misplaced swish of the wand can be fatal. And although Freifoth’s endeavors in the realm of spell creation caused no harm to himself, it would have profound effects on Strasbourg. 

While there was no established magical community in the vicinity of Strasbourg, Freifoth was not the only wizard living near the town. Frederick Berkfalk was a well-known Tierrache, a person who hunts magical creatures for components to be used in potions, charms, and wands. Berkfalk was also intensely disliked by Freifoth. The origins of the animosity between the wizards has been lost to time, but it is clear that Berkfalk and Freifoth each looked upon the other as someone might look at a plate of mashed bubotuber – with great distaste. Yet though there was open hostility between Freifoth and Berkfalk, the bad blood never went beyond the occasional jinx or infrequent flaming bag of dragon dung left on a doorstep. This minor feud between neighbors may have been a forgotten page of history were it not for what happened in July, 1518. 

It was a bright Summer day, and Danzer Freifoth was bringing a large basket of medicinal herbs to sell in the market of Strasbourg, as he did regularly. By happenstance, on the edge on the crowded marketplace, Freifoth observed Frederick Berkfalk selling the skins of some animals he had trapped. That is when Freifoth had an idea. He had been experimenting with a new spell, and had had great success on the toads and rats he had tested it on. It was a minor hex, but one that when used correctly could cause great embarrassment to the afflicted. Freifoth took out his wand and surreptiously aimed it at Berkfalk. Freifoth was preparing to cast Tarantellegra on a human being for the first time ever. 

He missed. 

Before Freifoth was able to complete the incantation, a Muggle woman named Frau Troffea walked between Freifoth and Berkfalk and was struck by the spell. Frau Troffea began to dance uncontrollably in the middle of the street. Normally, such a misstep could be quickly corrected by performing the counter-hex, leaving it to appear as though Frau Troffea had merely been possessed by a momentary desire to jig in the street. This was not to be, for while Freifoth had indeed perfected his Dancing Legs Hex during his free time, the same could not be said for its counter-hex. Freifoth tried to cast the counter-hex on Frau Troffea, but appeared to succeed only in creating a fizzle of sparks from his wand. However, Freifoth’s counter-hex seems to have had an effect on the Tarantellegra Hex that has not been replicated by magical historians and scholars with any spell in the five centuries since the incident. Freifoth’s attempted counter-hex made the hex itself contagious.  Frau Troffea would continue to dance without ceasing for almost a week. In that time, the dancing spread to other victims in Strasbourg – 34 within a week and totaling near 400 afflicted before the month was out. Exhausted by their exertions but unable to stop the compulsion to dance, some of those affected died from heart attacks or strokes. 

Muggle authorities were in an uproar, but strangely did not suspect magic of being the underlying cause of the plague, assuming instead that it was some theretofore unseen illness of the blood. The afflicted were isolated in two guildhalls and the local grain market, which appeared to stem the spread of the hex’s influence. It was 27 days before Freifoth could come up with a counter-hex. 27 days in which dozens of Muggles succumbed to the demand of Tarantellegra. As clandestinely as he had cast the original hex, Freifoth was able to quietly counter-hex the infected Muggles over the course of half a day. The Dancing Plague was over. Freifoth was later sanctioned by the Holy Roman Wizengamot and fined a Galleon for the event. No doubt, the penalty would have been steeper if the Muggle populace had suspected magic played a role in the Plague. 

The Dancing Plague of 1518 is thus of great interest in the annals of magical history, not only for being the only known example of a contagious hex, but also as an illustration of the impressive powers of denial possessed by Muggles and the importance of proper spell crafting.

It says that ""propositions are types, proofs are well-typed programs"" and it has surprisingly little to do with undecidability.

There are other correspondences between logic and computation. For example, Gödel's first Incompleteness Theorem^(1) can be proved by showing that a *sufficiently powerful recursively axiomatisable complete consistent first-order theory* could be used to solve the Halting Problem for Turing machines. Since the latter is impossible, so is the existence of the former. However, this does not extend to an equivalence like the one you suggest (in particular, undecidable in the logical sense is *not* the same as undecidable in the computational sense).

Logic and computation aren't fundamentally the same thing, and to understand their relationship, you'll have to learn both. I'll refer you to [Proofs and Types](http://www.paultaylor.eu/stable/Proofs+Types.html) for a gentle introduction.

0,yodatsracist,3,False,t3_2wzf99,"For the CHP, they probably need to change their entire electoral strategy, build grassroots for the first time since the Communists were going into the gecekondu in the 1970s. They're relying on identity politics (a ridiculous proportion of CHP voters are urban and secular or Alevi; that wasn't the case in the 90's) that will never have a plurality.  They probably can't outflank these parties from the left, promising an ""adil düzen"" like Refah did in the 1980's (CHP used to win the urban poor before Refah) because their financiers, the rich secularists, don't really want any economic policies that hurt them, so economically CHP and AKP have been pretty close every time I tried to look at their economic policies in detail (with AKP being traditionally slightly more EU friendly, but giving that up around 2007). To win, the CHP need to find a way to be open to moderate religious people without losing their secular base. Or Kurdish people without losing their nationalist base. Or maybe find another demographic group that they can win. But over all, demographics just are not on their side. The AKP runs strong all over the country. The CHP isn't even the main opposition party in like 2/3 of the country (look at Kayseri or Konya, MHP is usually second), and obviously can't hope to win many votes in the Southeast with their current policies (and the MHP's threat from the right keeps them from changing their policies) so that's like, what, 20, 25% of the country that's probably not voting CHP from the start? Demographics leave their strategy is just really limited. Any merger with the MHP will probably in total cost the two parties votes, as the religous right part of the MHP will probably jump ship as will some of the last leftist parts of the CHP. The high baraj means it's probably not smart for the moderate or Gülenist wings of the AKP to split and try to form a fifth party (I mean, look at Saadet) because there's no guarantee they could break 10% on their first election, and probably not enough momentum to carry them through two elections. The moderate AKPers would probably be better off just waiting for RTE to finish his term and see what happens next, see if someone they like like Gül takes over. Maybe an unlikely, unstable coalition of all the non-AKP parties could work together but all that unites them is not liking the AKP and it's hard to imagine such a coalition lasting very long in the unlikely event that one 1) gets enough possible votes (very unlikely it seems) and 2) actually forms (more likely the AKP would offer a sweet deal to the MHP). 

So, unless there's a giant crisis, either the consumer credit bubble bursts and Turkey goes into a serious recession, or what's happening in Syria starts crossing the border (beyond just refugees), I don't see any short term way that the opposition can hope to regain power. Historically, a coup would be a possibility, but the military was so thoroughly defanged after 2008, I don't think that would happen unless there was a real crisis (two sides killing each other in the street, like the late 1970's; a huge increase in terrorism because of Syria).",acemi ecnebi,cp15duq,False,0,False,1427524263,t1_cp13dv6,3,Turkey,,t1_cp15duq,1425244577,t5_2qlnu,,0

Yawn. I'm hearing a lot of conspiratard bloviating, but still nothing in the way of data and evidence to back it up. Sure, you can blindly parrot back your favorite talking points, but the JewspiracyTM or the NWO, or the immigrant plot to destroy the west don't exist just because you want them to. 

You *still* haven't cited any data to back up any of your claims- because there's isn't any- and instead you have to double over backwards to claim that having sources or evidence to support an argument just means that you're not an ""Independent Thinker"". Get this through your skull: independent thought does not mean that you pull shit out of your ass, dig your hands in deep, and sculpt it until it fits what you want to believe. Gullibility is not something to be proud of, and when you can't offer support for your assertions, you don't get points just because you made them up all by yourself like a big boy. 

**You're wrong about the JewspiracyTM**

&gt;It is set for their benefit, yes. Not only is this backed up by work from Professor Kevin MacDonald but Jews have admitted on record they want to turn non-White naitons in to ""diverse"" ones.

That's funny, I thought if you were capable of forming your own opinions you wouldn't have had to let a disgraced former quack ""academic""  do your thinking for you. Why are you incapable of an original thought? 

Kevin MacDonald can blubber all he wants about how the scary joooze ""evolved"" to be sneaky, but neither he nor anyone else can provide any documentary evidence for a conspiracy. If there is a JewspiracyTM why isn't there a leaked transcript of a ""jew-meeting"" where they all got together and decided what immigration policy to force on everyone, or a photo of the Rothchilds bribing world leaders to change international law, or *anything at all* in the way of physical evidence. Can you really not think critically, or do you just blindly accept anything that agrees with your anti-semitism?

Even if you are content to parrot back whatever Kevin MacDonald says without questioning it for yourself, why would you, as a white nationalist, care what the JewspiracyTM wants to ""turn non-White naitons"" into? Leave that to the ""non-white naitons"" to deal with.  

But ultimately, even if you were right about the conspiracy shit, even if the Jews were getting together to create immigration policy, you would still be empirically wrong about the things you claim immigration is doing to the country. Look at the litany of unsubstantiated, factually incorrect, and/or completely incoherent things you think constitutes an ""unbiased"" view of immigration. 

&gt;do you support,  

&gt;lowering wages

Wage stagnation is not caused by immigration, its caused by a whole host of factors [which differ greatly](http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2014/12/22-sources-real-wage-stagnation-bosworth)[depending on who you ask]       
(http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2014/11/06/whats_causing_the_wage_stagnation_101376.html) but all having to do with corporate greed and market fluctuations, not scary brown people. 

&gt; eliminating the middle class, 

Immigrants didn't do that, a combination of the financial collapse, stagnant wages (which, again, have nothing to do with immigrants) and outsourcing did that. Ironically, its the ""furr-in-ers"" who stayed in ""their own countries"" like you think that they should, who are the ones who ""took our jobs"".

&gt;turning your country into some Babylonian Balkanized region with warring factions,

Here's where you start babbling. Sorry to break it to you, Charles Manson, but the race war's not happening anywhere but in your mind. Show me once instance where Mexicans are breaking away and warring with white people, or shut the hell up. 

Mexicans didn't come to America to destroy it any more than the Irish or the Polish did, and in a few decades the white fear will subside, the new immigrants will integrate into society, America will accept the newcomers, and the blowhards who cried ""the wetbacks are coming"" will be seen as on the wrong side of history. And I say that with certainty because that's what happened with *every other immigrant group to this country*. Have you ever heard anyone in the 21st century complaining about an Irishman taking their job? A hundred years ago they did, what changed.

&gt;higher crime,

Source? And no, saying ""you know how those dirty brown people are"" does not count for a source. 

&gt;  higher taxes,

Forget that legal immigrants pay the same rate in taxes as you or I do, or that Ronald Reagan (who don't get me wrong, I hate) managed to slash taxes in half, while at the same time passing [amnesty for illegal immigrants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Reform_and_Control_Act_of_1986). Illegal immigrants pay [*billions* a year in taxes](http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/unauthorized-immigrants-pay-taxes-too) to the states and communities in which they live, and making them legal citizens *saves* the taxpayers money because they would then pay their full federal tax burden. On the other hand, rooting out, rounding up and deporting illegal immigrants would be incredibly costly to the tax payers and incredibly inefficient. How are you going to pay to clear the country of ""non-Whites"" without raising taxes?

&gt;higher housing costs,

I'm not sure what you're basing this on, do you have actual studies of the effects of immigration to an area on housing prices, or just a simplistic view of supply and demand: more buyers=higher prices? But let's say that despite the lack of sources, you're right about housing costs rising as more people enter the country, the flip side of that also means higher *property values*, which means more tax revenue, and increase in the wealth of middle class home owners. It's good for literally everybody accept for a handful of people looking to buy a home in an in-demand area.


&gt; more traffic,

I suppose that yes, technically, more residents means more people on the roads, but if you think we ought to base major national policy around shaving a couple of minutes off your drive to work, you're an idiot. 

&gt;feeling like a stranger in your own country

You say this as if it's a universal experience, but the vast majority of the public, who don't share your bizarre obsession with race, don't feel it. Even for those who do feel that way during a wave of immigration, it always eventually subsides.
Do you feel like a stranger in your own country when you pass an Irish pub or a Pizza hut? Do you weep for the purity of Anglo-american blood when you eat a brat or a pierogi? Why are current immigrants any different? Is it just your obsession over skin color?


**And you are wrong about the American public supporting you:**

&gt;None of them move to Black areas like East St. Louis. That is proof enough.

No, white people not moving in droves to East St. Louis is not proof that they want to racially cleanse all of the immigrants and brown people out of the country. I would have thought that was obvious.

&gt;Ask them if they would like to live in Liberia or Switzerland.

Switzerland? Seriously? Did you think that one through? I'd be more than happy to ask people if they would mind living in the [third most developed]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index#Complete_list_of_countries) country in the world, and the country with the [most competitive economy on the face of the Earth](http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015/rankings/), if it meant that they might have to see some black people. I think the response would be pretty favorable. 

Portugal's economy is so terrible that tens of thousands white people are [immigrating](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/16/portuguese-exodus-angola-el-dorado) [*to Africa*](http://m.bbc.com/news/world-africa-22025864), [to find economic opportunity](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/tens-of-thousands-of-portuguese-emigrate-to-fast-growing-angola-a-833360.html)
It's not Liberia per say, but most people don't share your insane fixation on race, and would be willing to move to an African country if it were economically beneficial. 

&gt;Most politicians pander by saying they will pass it.....but they haven't yet. Why? Bush was calling for it in '06 along with most of the sell-out talking heads. So why not? Because the AMERICAN PEOPLE LITERALLY SHUT DOWN the Congressional switchboard screaming bloody murder opposing it.

At the same time [HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LITERALLY MARCHED IN THE STREETS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_United_States_immigration_reform_protests) *against* deportation. That trumps a couple of old cranks making phone calls, and furthermore no amount of anecdotal evidence of phone calls supporting your side, or protest marches supporting my side can substitute for the polling data- which shows a public overwhelmingly in favor of legal immigration. And no, the fact that every single pollster refuses to sacrifice the neutrality of their methodology to accommodate white supremacist lies, does not prove that they're all biased. 

You have nothing to support the things that you claim immigrants are responsible for, or any evidence for the Jewspiracy ™, or the New World Order bullshit, or even the claim that the majority of people support you, and no amount of calling me a sheeple can substitute for that. It amazes me that when confronted with a lack of evidence to support the things that you just *know* to be true all you lot are capable of doing is sticking your fingers in your ears, and pretending that fabricating a conspiracy of Joooze or Blacks or imma-gints, can paper over all the places where your racial dogma doesn't real.

[Yes, I do.](http://colorlines.com/archives/2015/02/this_man_set_fire_to_a_houston_mosque_islamic_leaders_forgave_him.html)

As for the cartoons recently published that sparked all that craziness, there is definitely another side to that story.  A lot of the world's Muslims come from places where religious *police* exist.  Think about that for a minute.  Think about the kind of mindset and habits that generates.  Think about *1984* and what it was like for those characters if they didn't *appear* to be appropriately joyful in their vigorous patriotism.  That's *real life* in many Muslim countries.

Now take those people who have been living like that for their entire lives and transplant them to another country.  They wanted to get out because they know that there is a better way.  But the habits are already there, and for many reasons (not all of them *un*justified), Muslims haven't exactly been welcomed with open arms all over Europe.

So it's a mess.  No one is surprised.

Muslims in the United States are far enough away (physically) from all that that you don't see quite as many people so easily baited (which is how I warn my friends against it:  ""don't be baited"").  In the U.S., the ""sticks and stones"" idea is so pervasive that it prevents quite a lot of that trouble.

But in Europe, the situation is a lot more complicated.  If you *really* think the issue is about cartoons, I'm afraid you have *massively* oversimplified things.

I don't know if I can count the number of times I've seen some team lose and players comment, bitterly, that *we were the better team* but that *we were unlucky*. From an American perspective, we might not call the losing team ""unlucky"" but call the winning team ""clutch"". (*That was a clutch performance by the New England Patriots, who were just good enough to hold on to win the Super Bowl.*)

In the national first division leagues of Europe, there is very little parity. Parity is largely factored out because the dominant competition is generally leagues themselves, where the top of the table wins. If you are the better team on average, then you will win. Cup competitions exist in playoff formats, but rewards are variable among them. If you win the Football League Cup in England, you get into the Europa cup competition in the next season. It ain't the Champions League, but I guess it's something.

But those competitions, and the Europa and Champions league competitions themselves, are more interesting to me because their results are less predictable. There is more parity in them. You can have ""giant-killing"" teams from the lower divisions make heroic runs. Real Madrid can't run away with the Champions League against seriously heavy competition in Europe, and at any rate, any team can have a bad day and get knocked out. (See: Arsenal; Manchester City; well, most English teams in any given year.)

I don't think we'd lose our parity if we eased our salary cap, nor even did away with it entirely. We'd lose cost certainty, I think, but that is an entirely separate concern, of interest primarily to owners and their checkbooks. And this maybe is why the entry to the playoffs in MLS have been eased even more (to 12 teams, up from 10).  As more teams invest in more DP signings, and more expensive DP signings, the gulf between the haves and have nots will become wider, but the playoffs will remain an attainable goal.

For one thing, the US was the largest oil producer in the world at the time of the war.  Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor was precipitated by a US embargo on oil and metal sales to Japan in response to Japan's invasion of French Indochina.  If Japan had wanted to take the USA's oil, they would have had to have invaded Texas.  Their motivation in attacking Pearl Harbor was to, originally, make Hawaii a base from which they could threaten the US and gain greater negotiating leverage for US resources, but ultimately the plan was made to cripple the US naval forces in order to give Japan naval supremacy in the Pacific, forcing the US to end the embargo or else be unable to safely use the sea to conduct trade.  As for the US not being a major factor in the allie's win, you are (painfully) wrong.  If not for the US, it is doubtful the allies would have had chance of repelling the German invasion.  Japan declared war on the US for the very reason that the US was critical to the allied force's success:  resources.  Without US oil, steel, food, and military equipment, there is simply no way the allies could have won.  Japan, stricken from US resources, knew they had two years before they exhausted their supplies.  The Soviets themselves relied on US wheat and flour, and received large amounts of other resources as well.  Most importantly, the US almost single handedly defeated Japan  which, as may you remember, was one of the Axis powers.  Oh, and before I give up on your education, I seem to recall something about the UK, France, and every European country (except maybe a couple) not giving a single goddamn shit about Poland, Holland, or the Jews.

Also, I did find 7 torches but no more Ramaldni's Gift, so if LpSS is a necessary roll, I can still use my old one or reroll my actual Torch.

I can't seem to find a SWK Amulet so I can't play with a Leoric crown :(

Any general gear advices or build advices are welcome ! :D

Agreed.

&gt;1 series M coupe is a true M car, despite using a N-model engine.

I'm not sure M GmbH went through 1M's top to bottom. They may have, though, as they only made ~800 IIRC.

&gt;The M1 (the original) used an M88 engine, not S-model

To be fair, I don't think BMW was classifying their engines with N's and S's when the original M1 came out.

&gt;European E28 M5's used M88 engines, not the S38 North America later got.

Understood.

&gt;The only exceptions to the naming rules are the M635csi and the M535i of the past, and some would argue the 850csi as an M car.

I do miss the original 8 series. It's unfortunate that it's only made a return in BMW's electric product offering.

Wait wut? I've posted on every single match (except matches they posted while I was sleeping which is probably under 10), every single day. Don't act like I haven't given people exactly what they paid for. 

Furthermore, what I said is: I'm taking March off, since I've done this for two straight months without a break. With my playing schedule, and everything else I do, I'm extremely busy, and having to post on every match is extremely time consuming, when at times, I just want a break. So that's why I waited until the month is over and I've given you my honest work before I said I'm taking a break.

I also said, ""because some of you really want to follow my Katowice advice, and I'll be taking a break this month, I'll still run a group for Katowice, and the two lans following that this month (Gfinity and Starseries)"". Obviously you don't have to join, but I know some people really want to hear my opinions for those matches since I have never once gone negative during a lan event.

Why my price will likely go up to 3 keys in April (should I decide to start posting again that month): Not only do I plan on having a website that's easier to navigate and operate for everyone, and that will limit leaking, but if you haven't noticed -- CSGL is posting a crap ton more games than they were 2 months ago. They have been posting close to 20 matches per day (EU and NA combined). That's an INSANE amount of a jump from the 10 matches they barely posted before. There's no point in me putting in that amount of work for you guys, if it's not worth my while. This has become pretty much a job. I'm putting in the work to make it the best possible experience for you all. If you don't think what I have to offer is worth the 3 keys, then don't join. Many people can attest that my work is worth so much more. I've been told that I should charge 10 keys a month, others say 5, but I simply think that's way too much, even though I know people would still join. I want more people with less bank roll to join so they can learn about how to bet, instead of just telling the people with higher bank rolls of who to bet on (why 3 is better than 5 or 10).

I used to post for free for months to 4,000+ of you, and was very passionate about what I did.

No, they're things that a society stumbles upon as it were mathematics. Because they're based on constants. Science isn't invented, it's discovered.

&gt;Among the many things they require is a scientific mindset conducive to technological improvements.

&gt;To give one example, Western Europeans famously did not invent firearms, nor were they the first to understand that they could be useful. However, over time they proved the most able at improving, mass-producing firearms and maximizing their potential use by implementing them as part of an efficient military doctrine.

&gt;Infrastructure and resources are one thing, but not every culture holds the values that would be necessary to carry out such tasks. Now of course if you want to get real materalist about this,  

Who wouldn't? 

&gt;it could be argued that these very values are the product of having had access to such resources in the past and therefore that at the end of they Europeans just got lucky.  

That's what I'm saying.

&gt;But it remains that whatever might have replaced European modernism down the road would probably be very different from what we call modernism, and would have at least some other cultural traits and influence ascribed to it.

It's hard, like the above quote says regardless of the motives for the criticism of immigration, racists and the like will be drawn to those that hold that particular flame. Like many things it's not what you say, but how you say it. 

Many people are indifferent to immigration, however when UKIP has had people in it's employ blaming floods on homosexuals etc, people take notice and assume that the motives behind UKIPs anti immigration stance comes from a place of xenophobia and a general backwards attitude rather than legitimate concerns.

Nick Clegg had a speech on immigration back in August that I don't remember kicking up any major fuss. http://www.libdems.org.uk/nick_clegg_s_immigration_speech#

'And for years our immigration system wasn’t properly managed. Up and down Britain today, around kitchen tables, in the pub, at work, conversation will turn, probably for the millionth time, to the problems of immigration: the unfairness people feel; the threats they see to their way of life. 

Does that make you a racist? No it does not. More often than not these are understandable and legitimate concerns. Under the last government people were constantly told one thing only to then experience another. Some of our communities have undergone huge change over what is, relatively, a very short space of time. Labour failed spectacularly to manage that change and equally to manage public expectations – not least, of course, over the number of Eastern Europeans who came here as the EU enlarged.'

Despite being a UKIP supporter I'm sure you wouldn't disagree with the above passage.

Personally I'm indifferent to immigration, but I'm indifferent to a range of things. My main concerns are energy and agriculture. But from someone who's plonked in the centre, leaning perhaps slightly to the left. To me it seems that if the anti-immigration stance is to become separate from racists, then parties like UKIP (and the Tories and frankly probably most of them) need to hound them away from the discussion. There are legitimate concerns over immigration, and what is seen as a lack of control over the size of our population.

Of course there are intraracial migration, which is normal, and it's ok for a small number of Europeans to move to other European nations. But what is happening to Europe is far beyond that. Tsunamis of non-Europeans are flooding Europe. Europe will no longer be European.

They are very eager to leave the countries they have turned into shitholes. That is why they risk their lives and pay lots of money to float here on a leaky boat. If black/arab countries weren't such shitholes, if they weren't so eager to leech off of white people's resources... they wouldn't leave.

""It is actually less of a game to immigrants than you, for their standard of living in their homeland is destitute compared to Denmark""

It's not a game to them either, it's a game to the politicians. Of course their standards of living are bad, because they made it that way! And they don't give a shit about making their own nation a better place. They would rather take over ours. Then they take the indigenous people's place and displace and replace the natives and turn the area into the same shithole they came from!

I do know people from Ukraine, my family has friends there and in Georgia. That's why I know that the things that You say are simply not true!

It disgusts me how large empires have absolutely no respect for small nations. For them it's either the US way or the Russian way, but has it ever come to their attention that the empires should not have a say in all of this?! If there is a choice and the small country, that used to be a part of the USSR, chooses Europe, Russia somehow seems to view that as an attack from the USA.

Russia thinks it own's something! Newsflash - they don't own Georgia, they don't own Ukraine, they don't own Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan or Tajikistan. Actually they don't own the small ethnic groups that have been smothered by Russia to an absolute extinction either. If the people have managed to elect their leaders in a democratic manner, then the direction that the government chooses is absolutely no business of Russia! If there are countries that don't elect their leader(s) democratically, then no country should tolerate that.

Russia (yes, Russia, not just it's violently formed version USSR) has managed to repress so many nations in the history of humanity, that many have not survived, many are still fighting the legacy of poverty, poor development, hunger, cold and mass murders that this barbaric union headed by Russia brought us all. In no way is this acceptable, in no way could Russia argue if one of USSR's former members wishes to choose the European or the American way.

I live for the day when the true criminals of USSR and Russia are publicly convicted and forced to apologize for the horrors that they brought to it's neighbors and is still implementing on the small ethnic groups that have no right to learn their native language, that have no right to remember their culture! Thankfully there seems to be a rise of knowledge and understanding of why Estonia will never choose the Russian way.

0,hamjam5,1,False,t3_2x67wg,"&gt; peaceful except in this small and mostly harmless way

But it is not in some harmless way. When the tribally controlled property of Europe, north america, and the rest of the world was created, it was not done peacefully -- it was done through genocidal wars of extermination and conquest. And this property is not peacefully enforced either -- it is done with police and armies. There is nothing peaceful about the creation or maintaining of property, and the people who try to use violence on others to perpetuate or create private property will have to be physically fought. 

Now, I personally think that, if a bunch of people want to have private property for a certain area, and violence is not needed to maintain it, let's see how it works out. But, as soon as the people living in that area no longer want to respect property rights, and the owners try to use violence to enforce those ""rights"" that those people having violence visited upon them are completely justified in responding in kind.

&gt; Because these countries are relatively untribalistic

This entire line of argumentation from you makes no sense to me. Why would countries intervene more readily in the internal conflicts of another nation if said conflicts are more ""tribal""? I can see how you might think a tribal society might have more conflicts, but that isn't the issue. The issue is that countries with oil, whether they are tribal or not, have other countries intervening in their affairs 100 times more often. I mean, Sudan is not less tribal than Iraq or Libya, but it sure as hell has less oil. Similarly, Georgia is not less tribal than Ukraine, but it sure as hell has less fossil fuels. 

I understand it is not as simple as saying all wars are fought *solely* for control of resources and property, but studies like the one I cited really indicate that it is a central motivation. Look at all the money the people associated with the Bush administration made off the war in Iraq and Afghanistan -- you think that was not the central motivation? Look at World War 1 -- the U.S. entered that war almost exclusively because economic interests in this country had invested so much on the British side, and they were afraid they would not get paid back. And look at all the U.S. action in South America that were done at the behest of corporations like United Fruit. 

Yes, I feel quite confident that a system based on the accumulation of privatized property and where those controlling said property have a large amount of influence, that such a system is going to create a large amount of conflict and war, as those who stand to profit from conflicts use their influence to drive the powerful machinery of the State into such conflicts. And I feel further confident that dismantling this system of private property and States serving the interest of private property will lead to less conflict and violence in the world. 

&gt; Again, the question one must first ask is, what is the cost and benefit of said violence?

I don't disagree with that. The question of whether or not to use violence is always going to be situational. But that does not stop me from categorically not ruling it out as a methodology for responding to violence and oppression. ""By any means necessary"", as it is said.

&gt; I understand that, but violence can easily be led to authority, as can be seen in **any** real-world communist revolution. Even the Anarchist Catalonia Revolutionaries sucked on the tit of the state when push came to shove. I am not saying that compromise is a bad thing, I am saying that it is a dangerous thing, especially for the radical blanket anti-authoritarianism definitional amongst anarchists.

I disagree with your ""any"" that I bolded, but otherwise, I don't disagree with this. But I don't think it is reasonable to discount the anarchist perspective by saying that it may stop being anarchistic at some point. That is like the people who criticized Republicanism back in the 18th and 19th centuries by saying it would lead to anarchy and despotism. If people in the anarchist movement cease behaving anarchistically, trust me, I'll be the first to be at odds with them.

Yes but elsewhere they have that too, on top of rampant criminality and crippling poverty. The sole thought you are trying to equate the burdens on of an average EU citizen to developing countries just hints at your age and general mentality.

&gt;Bullshit, the alternatives include farming, service work, and prostitution. Pretty much the same shit people have been doing since before the industrial revolution.

So everyone has to reinvent the wheel for themselves? Might be a fair gamble if you reset everything to zero and start it off anew, at any rate, the world doesn't work like that. Don't you think our ancestors who fought and died for these rights would feel insulted by how they are being handled right now?

&gt;Do you honestly believe that? Because that's not what happens, when you force them to adopt western minimum wages the jobs move back to western countries because shipping makes it too expensive. Christ, this isn't even economics 101, it's common sense.

I did not say WESTERN wage minimum, I said wage minimum and basic necessities IN THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. A well paid worker in Bangladesh is still less expensive than a cheap machine in Europe. One salary here, is a whole factory there.

&gt;That's very idealistic but it isn't going to happen and I'm not sure it should. I believe in helping people to the extent that it doesn't impact my own standard of living, but all cultures/countries are not equal and my own comes first.

Ah yes, the typical helping when one can be arsed to. ""Never look down on anybody unless you're helping them up"" is all I can say.

""In spite of that, by the late Middle Ages society had reached a considerable degreeof complexity. Economically, many parts of Germany had developed from the backwaters they had been in about the year 1000 to leading regions in Europe While the medieval expansion of trade seems to have slowed down in the 14th century, it continued without much reversal into the modern age. In fact, gains from trade were realized to an extent that made merchants the economically
preponderant social group and earned the economy of the 15th to the 18th centuries the name of ‘‘mercantile capitalism’’ Among some merchants, exchange networks were stabilized by reputational mechanisms, but this was possible only within relatively small social groups or among individuals who knew each other well. Reputation had, therefore, severe limitations as far as the economy as a whole was concerned. The tailor from Ulm and the members of Colognes civic council, for example, did not expect to meet again and had consequently few incentives to care about their reputation with each other. Still, not everybody's experiences were as bad as Sindelfinger. Successful interaction of members of Fenris slid in after that, feeling Hawke's groan shudder through his body. He pushed all the way in and stayed there for a moment, sliding his hands down the planes of Hawke's stomach and underneath his robes to tangle in his chest hair, before sliding back and then slamming back in--Hawke braced himself on his elbows, burying his head in his arms which did nothing to muffle the needy whimpers on each thrust. This was his. Hawke was his. There was nothing else in this moment, but Hawke and Fenris and they were one. Hawke was his. Something that no one, not even the ghost of Danarius could take from him. Fenris brought the hand not holding Hawke's hip still around him and wrapped his fingers around the length of the mage, sliding down with the same slickness that was letting him move in and out of Hawke, pressure building between the both of them in a fire that extended past the pain and only the both of them existed. Hawke let out a quiet cry of release as he came and his muscles contracted around Fenris, mid-movement. Fenris did not last much longer after that. The pace increased, but Hawke's stuttered and complaint encouragement brought him to his end.""",,cp1dfls,False,0,False,1427528088,t3_2xlhjw,69,dragonage,2,t1_cp1dfls,1425259823,t5_2r8lo,,0

From you being misinformed, to you thinking that a Presidential Nominee is going to do as he promises. Was it Fox News or your Family told you Clinton went around invading sovereign nations while President of the United States?

I lived through the period and followed world events closely. Where were you?

&gt;Class time.. First off, Clinton didn't invade a single nation.. He did send peace keeping forces to Somolia after what happened in Mogadishu..

We bombed, invaded, and annexed a portion of Serbia without UN approval.  We then allowed the Albanians to ethnically cleanse the Serbs out of Kosovo.  That was a major war crime that NATO and most of the people involved still refuse to acknowledge.

Hell General Wesley Clark ordered a British unit to attack a Russian unit that was occupying a Serbia airbase.  The moron could have started WW3 but fortunately the British commander had more sense than to follow that order:

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1562161/Gen-Sir-Mike-Jackson-My-clash-with-Nato-chief.html

In Somalia we turned a relief operation into a mini war trying to force the people we wanted into power by using special forces and then we failed to provide those forces with the heavy weapons they needed in case they ran into trouble.  It was an ill advised adventure that got Americans killed for no gain.

&gt; Or maybe you're talking about the few hundred peace keepers he sent to Rawanda?

In Rawanda we sent in troops after the Hutu's had overcome almost a million of their people dead and returned with an army of their own to deal with the people murdering them.  Clinton's acted only once the people suffering genocide and organized themselves into an army and was fighting back. Most of the guilty parties fled the country and lived under US protection in UN camps and were never prosecuted for their crimes.

Also under Clinton NATO continued to advance in eastern Europe alarming the Russians and creating the seeds for future conflict. He transformed NATO from a defensive alliance to a tool of American foreign power.  

We essentially ran Russia fiscally during the Clinton years and instead of intuiting a Market economy, private property rights, and bringing Russia into the modern era our advisers helped loot the state from top to bottom.  We had a wonderful chance to integrate Russia into the west and blew it to make a bunch of people on wall street and their political backers rich.  Which led directly to the rise of Putin.

We also failed to normalize relations with Iraq. I didn't see the point of continue to torment that nation after it became clear they were not going to bend to our will and a policy of carrots instead of air strikes should have been adopted or we should have simply pulled back.  There was nothing to gain there as the invasion of Iraq showed us.

Seeing how poorly we'd done reshaping the world under Clinton I wanted a candidate that would back off and let regional powers handle their own affairs without the US butting in all the time.  Candidate Bush promised an American pull back while Candidate Gore promised more of the same.

The good thing for these two teams is that since they play each other next round of the EL, one is sure to be a lot closer to winning the EL while the loser can focus on La Liga quickly.

So I'd say whoever wins the round of 16 game should focus 100% on the EL as a way to qualify for the CL.

By the way, we always talk about how tough it is to finish top 4 in England, but English teams don't do that well in Europe. Especially not the ""smaller"" teams. Look at Liverpool this year, freaking 8 European games (6 CL, 2 EL), and one single win! And only thanks to a last minute penalty. If this isn't pathetic... And Tottenham who rests its players to focus on the League Cup... how did it work out for them? lol
When in Spain, you have teams like Atletico Madrid who used to not even qualify for the CL. And now you have Sevilla that won the EL last year and will likely not qualify. To me, it shows that the best league (as in the most talent and best teams) is definitely La Liga, not the PL. Cause the teams who don't qualify for the CL in Spain are totally CL worthy.

Alex Ferguson is getting worried about his team's recent poor form against Arsenal. He just can't understand it, Man U are the biggest club in Europe, have all the best players etc, but every time they play the Gunners, they get beaten. So Alex gives Arsene Wenger a call and explains his problem. Arsene is very understanding and invites Alex down to watch his team training. 

So Alex turns up in London and spends  a day watching the Arsenal players. 
At the end of the training session he says to Arsene ""I still don't understand, we seem to do all the same things in training that you do, but you still beat us all the time"". ""Ah"" says Mr Wenger, ""I don't think its anything to do with the training. I think its because my players are more intelligent than yours"". 
Alex looks a bit peeved and asks Arsene ""What the hell do you mean by that?"". ""Well"" says Arsene, ""We also train our boys in lateral thinking"". To demonstrate his point he calls over Dennis Bergkamp. ""Dennis, here's  a problem for you. He's you father's son, but he's not your brother; who is he?"". ""That's easy"" says Bergkamp, Its me."" ""Correct"" says Arsene. Alex is very impressed. 

He goes back to Manchester and next day in training he calls over David Beckham. ""David, I've  been talking to Arsene Wenger and he reckons his players are more intelligent than ours"".  ""That's bollocks, Boss"", is Beckham's considered reply.  ""OK"", says Alex, ""I've got a question for you. He's your father's son, but he's not your brother. Who is he?""  Beckham looks blank and replies ""Need some time to think about this one boss, can I tell you tomorrow?""  Alex agrees and Beckham goes home thinking about the problem. He asks Posh Spice, but she hasn't a clue what he's talking about. He eventually  decides to give Jaap Stam a call, thinking that as Arsenal have a lot of foreign players, maybe he will understand.  ""Hello Jaap, its David. I've got a question for you. He's your father's son, but he's not your brother. Who is he?"".  ""That's easy"", says Jaap, ""Its me"".  

So Beckham calls over Alex Fergurson the next day in training and says  ""Morning Boss, I've got the answer to that question""  ""OK. What is it?"" asks Alex.  ""Its Jaap Stam"" replies the confident Beckham.

Greece has essentially build a large part of its economy on spending borrowed money with in core is exactly what more spending to get out of the crisis would be. 

Having said that I do believe that you're able to get out of an economical crisis by increasing spending. However Greece has primarily a financial crisis which causes the economical downturn coupled with an general loss of an artifical height due to unsustainable policies which no responsible policy could undo. Further spending in this situation would only treat the symptons while making the situation worse.

As such Greece in its current situation is capable of, while losing quite some quality of living and creating social problems, repaying its debts over the coarse of quite some time. Additional money gifts would allow them to to increase social policies again to lessen the impact on the general population.

It wasn't Russian economists who introduced the ban, it was Tsar Putin. And if you look at the article you find

http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/putin-s-import-bans-no-renaissance-for-russian-agriculture/505147.html

&gt; ""We are the kind of country, the kind of government, which can and should feed itself,"" Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said earlier this week.
&gt;
The bans — which target imports of meat products, fish, fruit, vegetables and dairy products from the EU, the U.S., Australia, Canada and Norway — will ultimately serve Russia's farmers, he added, before concluding, ""We are well-placed to fundamentally change the situation in agriculture.""
&gt;
At first glance, the sudden cancellation of about $9 billion in food imports could look like a windfall for an uncompetitive agricultural sector suffering from two decades of underinvestment.
&gt;
But increasing Russian agricultural production will take at least five years, provided there is substantial investment and good state policies, according to Natalya Shagayda, director of the Center for Agricultural Policy at economic research university RANEPA.

I.e. they banned imports and domestic production can't replace them. Hence the price rises.

From TFA

&gt; Freezing prices may also be in the interests of the supermarkets although it will eat into their profits, analysts say, as it may help them escape worse measures from the government.
&gt;
&gt; The list of products covered has not been announced, but the newspaper Vedomosti reported that it will include meat, fish, milk, sugar, salt, potatoes, cabbage and apples.

I.e. meat, fish, milk are all on the ban list and the supermarkets are freezing prices to avoid the government doing something even more draconian.

&gt;I have the thought process that if something is ultimately unprovable, if there is no way whatsoever to measure it to make such a decision, then I honestly don't think that it exists.

I was thinking about this the other day, how can we know for sure that all that matters is provable? It's just as much of an axiom as any other, albeit a practical one, and dare I say a comforting one.

&gt; As for philosophical debate topics: I'm an atheist so I'm not really interested in god's existence and man as finished creation discussions.

Well are you not interested in the question of God's existence or do you just have the opinion that he doesn't exist? Seems to me you're still interested in the question if you hang around on this sub (which is great btw). The man as finished creation is a question that is mostly irrelevant to the existence of God, although it is addressed by many religions, so I don't see why anyone shouldn't be interested by it. Nietzsche was very interested by it, and he was as much of an atheist and anti-theist you could find.

&gt;Other topics like morality and whether man is naturally good or bad I think could be tested with psychological tests, brain scans, behavioral experiments, and studying evolutionary psychology.

This again, is a question that we must turn to philosophy to answer, because there is no measurable *a posteriori* element for ""good"" or ""bad"" in the world, you *must* decide of something as a reference. The process of coming to that decision is part of philosophy (more specifically, morality). After you have decided on such things, using scientific/technological methods in order to optimize good and minimize evil in humans or whatever would be most appropriate. I'm sure you're familiar with Sam Harris' argument for science being able to arrive to answers to religious questions, but his argument is quite wobbly and he simply makes assumptions that his audience agrees with all of his preset axioms.

Really? Irish were treated worse then blacks. That's a fact. I have an article in the link. Japanese people got all of their belongings taken and got rounded up into concentration camps. Japs would get surgery to look white. Ever hear of the Chinese Exclusion Act? They wouldn't let anyone into the country. Chinese were heavily discriminated against.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act

Also, as I said, the Chinese were in ghettos as well. Still with a high IQ and low crime rate. Are you telling me that ghettos raise IQ in one group and lower it in another? Do ghettos do different things to different groups?

&gt;Comparing the Holocaust to Slavery is comparing Apples to Oranges. It's easy to argue that the Holocaust was far worse than slavery simply by the trauma and death count but I propose that it wasn't the horror of slavery that set blacks back but rather a systematic institutionalization of the vast majority of the black American population, a population literally introduced to the region for the sole purpose of slavery, throughout multiple centuries that created a disadvantageous culture of stupidity that runs rampant amongst the black population of America.

Please. I don't want to start diverging on the Holocaust. Just know, it's not what you're told. Most of the ""horrifying pictures"" of the treatment of the Jews was a result of allied bombings of German supply runs as well as bombing of German bridges so they couldn't bring food in. Are you going to feed your PoW or your soldiers?

The point is, groups have been heavily discriminated against and still have found success in America. ""Systemic racism"" is such a bullshit excuse. It's false and people still bringing it up are stopping us from getting to the actual root of the problem. People blaming everything on black people's downfall is simply not true. People in the same situation as blacks generally come out of where they are. Look at poor whites, there are double the amount of whites on government assistance then blacks. Where are these dangerous white cities? They don't exist. Crime is not correlated with SES. It's genetic as seen here.

&gt;The Role of Parenting in the Prediction of Criminal Involvement: Findings From a Nationally Representative Sample of Youth and a Sample of Adopted Youth 

&gt;“The role of parenting in the development of criminal behavior has been the source of a vast amount of research, with the majority of studies detecting statistically significant associations between dimensions of parenting and measures of criminal involvement. An emerging group of scholars, however, has drawn attention to the methodological limitations — mainly genetic confounding — of the parental socialization literature. The current study addressed this limitation by analyzing a sample of adoptees to assess the association between 8 parenting measures and 4 criminal justice outcome measures. The results revealed very little evidence of parental socialization effects on criminal behavior before controlling for genetic confounding and no evidence of parental socialization effects on criminal involvement after controlling for genetic confounding.”

Taking into account the socialization aspect of parents, they found that genetics overrides it. How you raise your children has no bearing on whether or no they'll be criminals or be privy to criminal activity.

&gt;Slavery in colonial America is simply incomparable to nearly any other form of oppression and is distinguished not by its cruelty or horror, but by its ability to literally form the entire ethos of the oppressed subject. Throughout the Holocaust the culture and religion of Judaism stayed strong. When the Irish were seen as one rung above apes in the social hierarchy they still preserved their culture holding many gatherings that preserved the Gaelic culture and Catholic religion.

Jews were actually treated well in camps, contrary to what you're told. Irish had a tough mindset. What happened to blacks? You can't blame every single problem on slavery, when groups have had it just as bad, if not worse then American blacks. As I said, it's simply not a true statement.

&gt;What separates American Slavery from these other atrocities is the fact that, up until recent African heritage movements, the culture of the black American population for the past many hundreds of years has been a culture and mindset specifically fabricated by white American plantation owners.

Blacks lower IQ is the cause of their environment and SES. To blame another group for it is bullshit.

&gt;This was a culture emphasizing subservience to the master and denying any form of free thought. This isn't a short period of history either. The black population of America followed the way of life of subservience and abolition of thought for centuries.

After they were free, they had a choice, did they not? I don't understand people who blame slavery on the plight of blacks in this country. Is it only American blacks? The blacks on the higher end of the Bell Curve, ( which there are very few of) from Africa come to America and make a nice life for themselves. It's nothing to do with a history of enslavement. It's everything to do with IQ and genes. You obviously have a small group of individuals of the race who will be on the far right end of the Bell Curve and will be able to find success in America. ""Systemic racism"" has nothing to do with it.

&gt;It's easy to imagine that generations upon generations of people unable to form more than a handful of complex thoughts would lead to a default state of stupidity for the typical black man in America.

You're wrong. You're basically blaming whites for the plight and state of the black in America today. Let me give you a good example.

Look at Rhodesia. The white farmers were there, farming the land. Mugabe kicked them out. The more intelligent blacks who realized that they needed the whites tried to get them to teach them how to farm, but Mugave found out and put a stop to it. Now, today, they struggle to survive and live a horrible existence without whites.


&gt;Now throw these incredibly stupid people who have only known service into the frying pan of freedom and what do you get? Degeneracy and thievery and an entire culture of people forced to grow from infancy to adulthood in a world that would rather see them bow or die.

The study I linked to above throws your argument out the window. Crime is, for the most part genetic. Also, see this.

&gt;American black males are twice as likely than American white males to have MAOA-L which has been linked to crime, violence and aggression in scores of studies going back over fifteen years. Black males are also 13.5 times more likely to have a rare version of the gene associated with “extreme violence and extreme aggression.” Latinos and American Indians are also nearly twice as likely as whites to have the more common version of the gene. However they are only about one fourth as likely to have the extreme version compared to blacks.

This is one of the genes they found that causes high aggression. As I have previously stated, most everything we do is genetic. For instance, IQ is .85 percent heritable with the other .15 percent coming from prenatal conditions, mainly the amount of oxygen that gets to the fetus.

&gt;Bring up any sort of biological argument about the size of a negro cranium you want but to deny and minimize the effects of slavery is simply incorrect.

Genetics has most everything to do with the plight of blacks in America. Slavery has no bearing on today. They cause their own problems.

You say SES. Does low SES cause blacks to rape 100 year old women? To burn women alive? No. They are genetically more violent. They have higher testosterone then Europeans and Asians. 

Blacks themselves are the cause for their own problems. Not any bullshit excuse like slavery.

Like with everything else in life, it would depend entirely on context. Yes, I would cry foul on say, the use of the word nigger to dehumanize and demean black people, because the historical context behind that particular word is indisputably one of oppression and injustice. However, I would not say the same about the use of the word negro in the context of the mid-20th century because, even though it is outdated and potentially offensive by today's standard, it was a step in the right direction in that place and time. 

Perhaps I am mistaken on this matter, but my understanding of the word Oriental has never been that it was a pejorative term, but rather a general term for people from a certain part of the world. Much the same as N.A./Western Europe is collectively called the West or some version thereof. Not that my understanding of the word is overly important here, I'm just wondering if I've got this wrong.

&gt;Some words fall out of favor -- I think it's our job as a society to keep up with what is acceptable and what is not.

The Hon member is regrettably confused by the fact that he has the right to do something does not mean he doesn't have a duty to not do it. A motion is not binding, the Hon member will not go to jail if he obstructs it, but it is nonetheless and expression of the will of Parliament, which is in turn the representatives of the people. To not follow through with a motion is exactly and undemocratic as doing the same with a bill, that it is constitutionally allowable is no excuse. The Hon member's understanding of democracy seems worryingly poor, and I feel I must call into question if he will be able to be function as part of a minority government if he can't wrap his head around it. I believe any government that ever refuses to enact the provisions of a passed motion, regardless of the politics of that government and barring the gravest of circumstances, should face a vote of no confidence from the House for behaving so appallingly. Of course in this particular case, this Government is already on its way out, so no need for any of that.

What is perhaps most tragic about the Hon member's position is that he would most likely be incensed should a government refuse to act on a motion he supported. He cannot see the forest of democracy for the trees of this particular motion.

&gt; Except that isnt what the motion did. The motion threatened that the government would initiate a VONC against the EU commission.... which is completely absurd and out of proportion for the EU negotiating the treaty. It is a completely absurd, dangerous and childish motion.

Like many European colonies, the Portuguese split their claims up by lines of latitude and assigned certain people or groups to each parcel (the Portuguese called them captaincies).

The north and south borders of the captaincies were defined by the Portuguese king via royal decree. The western border was defined by the Treaty of Tordesillas between Spain and Portugal: Portugal got everything east of the line within the New World while Spain got everything west.

The borders were nominally enforced by the Portuguese king, though like /u/waiv mentioned settlement was mostly confined to the coast. Internal border disputes were the least of the colony's problems: all but 4 of the captaincies had failed by 1549. Most were either left unsettled (due to the donee not having the means to settle them) or overrun by the native population.

For other countries, these types of borders were enforced through the parent country's legal system and minor skirmishes. For example, border disputes between the Pennsylvania and Maryland colonies in British North America led to a decades-long series of violent spats that ultimately ended with a peace agreement brokered by the British Crown and the establishment of the Mason-Dixon Line.",,cp1jjzn,False,0,False,1427530944,t1_cp1f6zp,14,MapPorn,Camera,t1_cp1jjzn,1425271826,t5_2si92,,0

Now why did the former champion of Mideastern secularism put it there in the first place? It was done after the 1991 uprisings to appease the radical Islamic clerics/groups, which goes back to my point interestingly enough.

Another reason is that while I am an American, I'm also Iraqi, and considering this sub is about various Middle Eastern conflicts and since I have direct affiliation with the Mideast, it's probably more fitting I use an Iraqi flair.

Some history: This flag was made in 1963 in anticipation of joining with Syria and Egypt (hence the 3 stars) and isn't necessarily a Ba'ath thing. Only after the UAR fell through did they change the meaning of the 3 stars to the ideals of Unity, Liberty, and Socialism (Arab socialism, not to be confused with European socialism). 

The 60s-80s were also a golden period for Iraq, where it went from a noname underdeveloped country to the top of the developing world and remained there even after the Iran-Iraq War. Iraq since the start of the embargo is forgettable and painful for many. It's funny how many old Iraqis I meet who emigrated in the last several years, for them the last point in time they feel like talking about is before the Iraq War, and often before the full embargo too. Then the few that do talk about more recent times, all of them have direct and extended family who either starved to death or were killed/kidnapped by various warring groups in the last couple decades in the war and embargo. My mom's cousin who was living in her old family home had 1 or 2 of her brothers murdered and  other relatives/friends too. Mind you, they were living in the Green Zone of Baghdad.

Anyways, I don't feel the need to get into rants about Khomeini, every radical group, every radical Islamist regime particularly in the Gulf/Iran, and so on in the Mideast/North Africa who are responsible for most of the shit in the Middle East to start with, so I will speak no further. The Ba'ath (and now Dawa) had the misfortune of having to deal with most of it. It only got bad in the 80s, which, going back to my last post, followed the Islamic Revolution, no surprise.

I certainly hope you didn't think that they thought that smashing some planes would cause the US to implode.  (Though it did give Dick Cheney and the neocons a good excuse to create a lot of self-inflicted damage in the US.)  So, it's absurd to say that they thought God wanted them to knock over buildings, and they clearly knew that the attack wouldn't ""topple"" the US, so what was going on?  Why do it?

Bin Laden's main goal was overthrowing the current Saudi royal family and having Saudi Arabia be a more pure, fundamentalist ""caliphate"".

Likewise, Mugabe represents the corruption inherent within the government, and removing him will do nothing. Look at Egypt: the regime remained the same (the military held all the power) and it will continue to remain the same, with or without a democratically elected president. 

Politics is less about people that it is about groups of people, so we have to examine how technology changes groups of people in relation to one another. In general, it looks like it empowers everyone and only a few at the same time. For example, in China we can't really call it this weird soviet, north korean wasteland of chilled, quiet people. Instead, Chinese use social media to call out local communist party members and make life bearable. But the Chinese government also uses it to destroy opposition.

The logistics of buying a slave, or the situations that you could create to blackmail someone to being a slave, make it too expensive. Also, being a slavemaster is not an enviable position, slavemasters are usually slaves themselves.

Slavery is just an awful, miserable economic situation that arises only through force and coercion from the government or by organized crime, and the idea that anyone makes a lot of money off slavery is a fallacy (sex trade aside, as vices tend to be quite profitable and moreish). 

As for military weapon trading, there's all sorts of reasons for it not being popular. In the US, who are primary users on reddit, it's a lot easier to make your own 'military grade' weapons through modifications or loopholes in the law or just flat out paying for it. You can buy pretty much any gun in the US with enough money, stupid exceptions aside like the street-sweeper shotgun (a specific revolver shotgun model, we have plenty of other revolver, not to mention semi and fully automatic shotguns of much better design).

There are people out there who may have access to firearms and could provide them to US citizens at great profit - say someone in Mexico or Syria, but the DNM just isn't big enough to attract people in those businesses to sell on the internet. 

The punishments are also extremely heavy, draconian, which is why in Japan drug usage is so low (Less than 1% in Tokyo, the highest drug usage city in the country, and of that 1%, meth and weed are neck and neck). When the punishments are that high, you instead just go for an alternative - alcohol, a huge underground sex market, and bladed or blunt weaponry. 

It would be quite expensive to ship weaponry, prohibitive enough that many suppliers won't take the risk (they're already doing just fine doing local business likely, an arms dealer in Syria isn't exactly short on customers), and prohibitive enough that buyers will just go for an alternative.

So if you want to go murder people, use a bladed/blunt weapon. If you want legitimate self defense, you can use a bladed/blunt weapon, and likely either live in an area where violent crime is so low that you wouldn't feel the need for a firearm (especially since the penalty if you got caught would be so damn high), or live in an area where guns are just easily obtainable that you don't need to pay mad bitcoin for it online.

As for guns being fun, well, there are plenty of options for fun usually. That's why airsoft is *so* damn popular in Japan, because it's so anti-gun. When it costs $2k+ for a piece of shit taurus, suddenly fabricating your own firearms or explosives isn't that bad of an idea.

It's definitely disenfranchisement to not be able to carry a gun, but when people live in safe areas, they become complacent about their rights and just let the government take them away from them. People in Europe live a cushy life so could care less about being restricted their freedom on firearms, people in the US live cushy enough that they don't really care that they live in a police state. There's no difference. If most people are doing okay, people tend not to bitch.

I'd say a well-educated suburb of around 50,000 like [Oak Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Park,_Illinois) would fare a lot better than just ""surviving.""  There are no Malthusian issues.  There's a whole planet's worth of virgin flora and fauna to be exploited.  When you have guns (or even crossbows kludged together from truck springs and piano wire), deer-like animals with no innate fear of man might as well have ""eat me"" painted on them, and even the scary lion-like animals are more food source than threat.

The happy hunting in the immediate environs of the town won't last forever, but it buys you time to set up agriculture.  And you have an entire planet's worth of animals to chase and/or domesticate.

Historically, when people show up in virgin land, the exact opposite occurs.  The first inhabitants of Hawaii and New Zealand showed up in canoes -- quite possibly lost at sea, with unimaginably less (in terms of both assets and knowledge) than our suburbanites (who likely include at least a handful of professors, doctors, mechanics, engineers, soldiers, scientists etc) bring to the table.  And those populations exploded. Hawaii was not settled until the first millennium AD, yet some estimates place the population of Hawaii just prior to European contact in 1788 as high as a million.

Even Easter Island experienced a population boom when they arrived; the people just made some very stupid, self-destructive decisions once they had been established there for many centuries.

Liquification adds a significant amount to the cost. That is why Medvidev was so cocky a few years back when asked about if North American LNG would be a threat. But even with liquification and delivery to the port of Hamburg, US LNG was only roughly 7% more expensive than Russia's pipeline delivered gas, although this was a couple years ago. 

So I have to wonder if some countries in the Eastern EU would actually pay less for North American LNG than Russia's pipeline gas. In North America LNG is roughly 3-4 times the price of pipeline gas.

- snow cover is not the same as average temperature, and the smaller the region you pick is, the less relevant the data is;

- while the ignorant could believe the two (snow cover and average temperature) are the same there are still periods of time when the average temperature is still negative in much of the northern parts (Scandinavian countries in Europe are very much at the same latitude as Alaska and the southern tip of Greenland), and over those intervals the snow cover does not reflect temperature but instead humidity (there is snow at -15 degrees and there is snow at -5 degrees even if the temperature warmed by a whooping 10 degrees); not accidentally the December-February interval is one of those and was picked by the con artists;

I don't know what you were trying to say but if you actually look at some of the data there is not much of a difference between the sizes of catholic and protestant families.    
      
""Roughly the same percentages of Protestants (56%) and Catholics (54%) say a smaller family is ideal, while about one-third of each group says a larger family is ideal. Those with no religious affiliation are much more likely to say a smaller family is ideal, with 70% preferring two children or fewer and 21% preferring three or more children.""

In fact conservative protestant families and the church of latter day saints families have the largest families by religion in the United States.    
With Europe it is hard to tell seeing as areas usually follow the same trends as their neighbors even with different religions.        
Agricultural areas and subsistence farmers have larger families and are more likely to be religious.   
Those are the people we should stop from having lots of kids; the people who can't afford to feed, clothe, educate, or medicate their children not the people with the third highest average household income by religion in the country.

5:30pm is when your body can tolerate the most pain according to science.  Take a couple of Advil an hour before if you're worried. 

The hair has to be about a 1/4 inch long to do it. If you've never shaved or trimmed, it's a good idea to trim with scissors before. Long hair equals more pain. 

The first time hurts the most. Exhale as she yanks the wax off. It helps. 

The key to maintenance is moisturizing and exfoliating. Using an unscented, white lotion every day will help. Using a mesh sponge is a great way to exfoliate. Nothing too harsh.

0,DoorToSummer,1,False,t3_2xlc7e,"Because I ~~don't really feel like composing an essay on Texas Secessionism at 2:00 in the morning~~ can't sleep and am going to write you one anyway: an independent Texas makes a nice what-if to dream about, but was never truly possible in the past (long-term, that is; it was clearly viable enough in the short-term), and cannot occur in any present or near-future that I could think of as worth living in. 

I mean, without a time-machine, questions of whether Texas could have made it on her own on a permanent basis are kind of pointless. However, for the sake of completeness, I'll just say that we would have, if we were not faced with outright conquest from either Mexico or the US, we would have been swallowed piecemeal by both.

That brings us back to the possible presents/near-futures in which Texas could secede from the US. I see two main ways it could go down.

The first is the ""No Civil War Scenario"". It's the one where, well, there isn't a civil war over Texas attempting to secede. Now, like it or not, the precedent for states wishing to secede from the Union has been set: they can't, and the Federal government will exercise military force to stop them. So we have a world in which the US *cannot* exercise that force. Why? Because it's military has been decimated in some disaster? Because it's economy has? Because they both have? Don't care, that's not a world I want to see. Leave completely aside any questions of blah-blah-american-imperialism the-US-could-stand-to-be-taken-down-a-few-pegs, whatever (Really. I don't want to hear about it from whatever side. It's irrelevant to the human cost). Think about it, will you? Widespread poverty/disaster and/or unrest. Not a cost I think worth seeing the whole nation pay so Texas can play house in the ashes.

And then we have the ""Civil War Scenario"". It starts off happier, since whatever theoretical nastiness that renders the US incapable of reacting to secession hasn't happened. But it'll be knee-deep in misery of it's own soon enough. I mentioned the precedent set by the Civil War above. Whether or not you think it was rightfully set, it *has* been set. And no matter what set of justifications our theoretical secessionists from Texas raise, the US cannot abandon it. To do so would mean the dissolution of the Union just as surely as if by force of arms. So it'd be Civil War. Again. Brother against brother, friend against friend. It'd be dirty, and horrendous, not guaranteed at all to even succeed, and in general bring about a whole bunch of pain and suffering that, once again, I don't think worth paying just so Texas can call itself a Republic again. I mean for chrissakes, don't you have *any* friends or relatives from out of state? Do you seriously want to see a war come between you? And as a practical matter, even if Texas did win such a war, how would it support itself? Trade with the US it's victory has just decimated? Not going to be good economic relations in such a climate, not to mention that the war will have destroyed all kinds of industry. With other nations then? On the basis of what treaties and trade agreements? *Texas* has none, they're all with the US. And there's more than one country in Europe (and the rest of the world, for that matter) that has no desire to encourage secessionism from anyone. Don't expect sympathy there. So then our grand new Republic is alone, its economy in shambles and without friends abroad. Sounds like fun.

Texas and the US are not the Czechs and the Slovaks, who were thrown together by outside forces and extricated themselves with mutual goodwill as soon as they were left to their own devices. Nor is our situation that of Britain and India, where one is clearly a foreign power that has conquered the other. Britain left India and remained Britain. That cannot happen with Texas and the US. We're woven together like threads in cloth. Even if you ripped it apart and sorted out each color piece by piece, you'd only have two piles of threads, not two whole pieces of fabric. Texas-and-the-US is not a combination in which either is diminished by association with the other. Our ideals and principles mirror and complement each other. To be asked to choose between the one or the other is a question that to me has no right answer. Either choice is equally heart-rending.

It sounds to me like you don't really understand what parliamentary sovereignty is. It relates to domestic legal affairs. Westminster obviously  isn't sovereign over foreign governments. So presenting examples of the UK government being challenged in the European Courts isn't an example of parliament not being sovereign in the UK. Furthermore, the UK government is only subject to the jurisdiction of the EU courts for as long as it voluntarily remains a member. Parliament could exercise it's sovereignty and leave the EU and no longer be subject to it's laws.

Parliament is sovereign in the UK, and if it were to pass an Act of Parliament dismantling the state pension, no legal challenge could be made. 

So thanks very much for your suggestion about the money you think we're saving in legal fees. But it's of no concern in the grand scheme of things.

I'm also not sure you fully comprehend that pensioners are the wealthiest age group in the UK. As you keep talking about the trivial amount you think we're spending on the ""wealthiesat pensioners"".

I'm not talking about the wealthiest pensioners. I'm talking about the *average* pensioner. Who is wealthier than any other age group in the UK and doesn't need a state pension to support themselves. We would save a vast amount of money by directing that benefit elsewhere.

You also keep talking about ""past agreements"". Past agreements between whom. By their very nature a state pension funded by future taxpayers is not something that those taxpayers can agree to. Today's pensioners *promised themselves* today's taxpayers would fund their pensions. Today's taxpayers didn't.

Cell phones would be great for this, but they're pretty impractical to build.

The point is, *even at supersonic, everything in Europe is in range*.

&gt;Strategic bombers aren't that useful in the era of SLBMs etc. a bomber is pretty easy to knock out of the sky, far easier that sinking a sub that can be located anywhere in the world.

Sorry but you don't know what you're talking about.

Strategic bombers today would act as missile carriers in a conventional war.

The missiles have a range of 3000 km.

The missiles used by our aircraft to shoot the bomber down have a range of 100 - 200 km.

You see now the role? The bomber will have fired its missiles and turned around before you can get within range to shoot it down.

Subs have their role, but so do missile carriers. Both would be used together.

&gt;Also since most of them are based in Engles one strike could take out a lot of the fleet.

&gt;The UK hasn't used strategic bombers since the Vulcans were retired the TSR2 was cancelled because there was no need for them after polaris was acquired

That's because we only considered them as *bombers* (in the sense of dropping gravity bombs).

It would be a completely different story for missile carriers.

And it was mainly cost and the fact that they were from the 1950's.

And after this, this rise continued up to more than 2,700 euro per hectare for so-called non-consolidated land. The prices continue to rise and lie between an average of 3,500 euro to 5,500 euro per hectare, depending on location and quality.

&gt;However, during the build up to these enterprises, investors from abroad have already bought ten percent of the farmlands through Romanian companies (Srl). And according to realistic estimations the current level of farmland use in the country would be no more than 25 percent.

0,derintellectual,2,1425302798,t3_2xacub,"&gt;That's a grim picture. I‌ think China and other old societies--Iran, too--have this problem of anomie all over. Eastern and Southern China is really different than Western and Northern. Although you may characterize it by Han vs. Uyghur or Tibetan or Zhuang or Yi or Manchu or Mongol or other smaller groups in China it could very well be a result of divergent *recent* historical and cultural experiences. For example, all the European concessions used to be on the Eastern coasts or when Japan invaded they did not advance far into Western China or during industrialization Southern and Northern China took on different roles.

&gt;So different parts of the people have seen different recent history and learned different lessons about how to cope. The correlation with ethnicity--Han itself isn't quite one descent group, rather a conscious cultural mix--may be by geographic accident rather than based on any cultural or individual principles. My hope is that they will be able to solve it peacefully since, as we already went over it, only an internal war has any chance of producing independence and such a war would involve a scale of bloodshed not seen since the Second World War. It would dwarf American wars.

China, for most of its history, has always been a centralised state in which different ethnic groups had to assimilate with the larger ideas of the dominate group. It hasn't really had a history like India or Iran where different armies tried to take huge chunks of the country, introduced a certain foreign culture, and when it did, it contributed to its diversity, but not to the same pluralistic level as like the Mughal or Safavid Dynasty. 

&gt;Consider that China, although you may view the Han people and/or the CCP elite as focused solely on material affairs, has come a *long* way in a short time which has required sacrifices of the finer aspects of culture. It is not a foregone conclusion that those finer aspects will not be revived once China is more economically stable, better capable of ensuring prosperity for its peoples. This is unfortunately something ethnic groups within diverse nations with old histories don't grasp as well as they should. Chinese prosperity is not all bad. It has conferred benefits on Uyghurs, too, even if it also has taken a toll on their cultures. Admittedly, there is probably quite some inequitable dealings involved.

It's not really as if they're against 'development' in its notions, they're against the fact its not done what is in line with their vision of development. It's like glass skyscrapers are pretty much status symbols in the West and now in the East, and not particularly known for its durability, whereas so called 'old' building styles are known for their longevity and more of an expression of their cultural identity. I don't think business will be conducted in such formal settings in the future. Plus, I think consumer still prefer to shop at traditional markets rather than shopping malls as long as the goods are up to date like in Istanbul's grand bazaar.

&gt;If the ethnic group vs. the nation, or the nation vs. the plurination, can solve the issues of culture, prosperity, equitability by peaceful compromises from all parties that's for the best. At the end of the day you want Uyghurs to have their rich cultural life while enjoying the amenities of the modern world, not to expend of both in search of nominal political autonomy which will rapidly subject them to other forces (Russians or Americans). Bear in mind any unifying ideology which could lead Uyghurs to wide scale war against PRC would itself take a serious toll on their culture. It will definitely involve revisionism regarding the mutually amicable life they have lead in recent times with their neighbors. We have seen this with other separatist and irredentist movements. Ideology always finds a need to distort history and that leads to a poverty of culture, even when the struggle is over a chance for cultural flourishing.

That's something I'd definitely prefer as well, but I'm not pitting my hopes on there being a fair compromise, at least not in the foreseeable future if recent events are anything to go by. I hope I'm wrong, but it looks grim. 

&gt;Edit: I‌ see newer responses to your thread. More informative ones. It's turning even more interesting :)

It seems to me that you could do better, even locally. I'm Aussie and I'd cringe at paying over $70.00. I suggest you search the markets a little deeper. 

Please disregard this advice if you are referring to sloppily cooked,  poorly crystallised METHamphetamine (Ice) that's been jumped upon more than a trampoline as speed. In that case you probably didn't do too poorly deal wise.

The thing is though, that as far as I can deduce, the speed over here is at best referring to racemic Meth. $50.00 a gram on our streets around 17 years ago. It is a 50/50 mix of both the right handed D isomer and the left handed L isomer of Methamphetamine made from Phenylacetone (P2P). You may have overpaid a little on this if it is in fact the product you purchased.

The much more desirable product is purely D Meth. Often referred to as Ice when made withe care and after a few recrystallizations then a few more until those babies big and shard like. This beautiful compound is usually produced via pseudoephedrine reduction. D is the optically active isomer. The one responsible for those lovely dopamine neurotransmitters flooding our brains and turning us into superhumans (open to debate). It is at least 6 times more potent than the L isomer which contains about as much kick as a Vicks inhaler. If this is what you call speed you got a fantastic deal! $300.00 locally on the markets but I believe the street price is still off its head with rumours abound that there are consumers out there still willing to part with $100 for a mere 100mg.

However it seems that upon these markets speed (even by Aussie vendors) is usually referring to Amphetamine. By the product description you have supplied, especially regarding the products hygroscopic properties (absorbing water from the air and going paste like - generally caused by pH being too low thus over acidic and not neutral as it should be). This is the $6.00 per gram product very easily imported from Europe with a very high safe arrival success rate. The belief that this is what you purchased inspired my opening paragraph questioning just how good a deal you really received.

Alas, I have been wrong before and there is every chance I am going to be wrong again many, many times between now and my expiration date. Please let me know if this is the case in this instance and allow me the chance to apologise for misinterpreting  your post and then typing a bunch of totally irrelevant stuff underneath it all the while deluded and believing I was actually helping when in reality I was just wasting words... way too many of them... sheesh.

Finnish Karelia and huge list of other places were illegally invaded during the second world war and they became parts of other countries, namely the Soviet Union, and now they are part of Russia... The thing is, either you can do something about that, or you can't, if you can't then you have to accept the current situation and make the best out of it.

&gt; Also, and I hate to bring up old history in modern politics, Cyprus is and has historically been greek. If I was a Greek in Cyprus I too would not have been happy that a people, who only exist because they changed culture and religion in the 16th century after being occupied by the Ottomans(Turkey), occupied half of my homeland.

Finnish Karelia as most of the land belonging to European Russia were historically inhabited by Finnic tribes. This doesn't give us any right to claim all those lands to belong to us. What matter is the current day situation. The fact of the matter is that in Cyprus there lives too distinct people, the Greek Cypriots, and the Turkish Cypriots that changed their culture and religion during the course of history. Unfortunately these two peoples couldn't live in peace inside a one country. There was coup, there was a civil war, there was the end of hostilities, there were population exchanges, and there was talk of setting up a federal government, as that federal government never came true, the northern side declared its independence. Later on before accession of Cyprus to the EU, the Greek Cypriot voters abandoned the unification treaty.

Now really, everything has already happened from civil war and population exchanges to abandoning of the unification treaty. So why drag this conflict more? Why not to recognize the situation as it is and try to make the best out of it. If there would be unification today, it wouldn't lead to unitary single Cypriot state, because there simply isn't one single population, but two different people that are tied by geography and common history.

Nu strică să le faci. E drept că se exagerează cu numărul de ore/semestre/ani în care se fac. Un pic de desen, să înțelegi noțiuni de baza (gen combinații de culori, perspectivă, etc.) nu strică. Dar se exagerează cu numărul de ore și cu faptul că se dau note. Mie desenul îmi scădea media în generală, nu pentru că nu respectam indicațiile profesoarei ci pentru că îmi dădea notă după talent (care lipsea cu desăvârșire). La fel și cu tehnologia și muzica.

&gt;___Phallus impudicus___, known colloquially as the __common stinkhorn__, and __dickes-nipes__, is a widespread [fungus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus) recognizable for its foul odor and its [phallic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phallus) shape when mature, the latter feature giving rise to several names in 17th-century England. It is a common mushroom in Europe and western North America, where it occurs in habitats rich in wood debris such as forests and mulched gardens. It appears from summer to late autumn. The fruiting structure is tall and white with a slimy, dark olive colored conical head. Known as the [gleba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleba), this material contains the [spores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore), and is transported by insects which are attracted by the odor—described as resembling [carrion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion). Despite its foul smell, it is not [poisonous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom_poisoning) and immature mushrooms are consumed in parts of [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) and [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany).

0,iVarun,1,1425301290,t3_2xmna0,"&gt; I do, personally, feel that it could possibly be a consequence of our insularity - we haven't really ventured beyond the confines of our little sub-continent, other than some excursions to SEAsia and trade with the Middle-East.

Not exactly. In fact both India and China were far more knowledgeable of the seas than the Europeans and for longer.  
Ming Dynasty Zheng He voyages to SE Asia and Africa were made before the Europeans embarked on their Sea voyages.  
Post that the Chinese just said, meh, we are not interested in making them colonies because of what i already listed.  
The Chinese were already self sufficient in everything, resources, technology, wealth, culture, and human capital. European states lacked everything and were on top of this competing against each other so they took by force these new places.  

So the answer to part of the Needham Question on this aspect is China *chose* to not make colonies.   

This can be expanded to other things as well, they chose not to test themselves and part of the reason for that is because they saw no need to test themselves, why do so, there is no competition, they were top dog. The situation is no longer the same so they won't stop now and they will compete. 

&gt; That was my point of difference with you, in my previous comment. I don't quite share your optimism that they will come into equilibrium ever, to give us that decisive edge. I could well be wrong, as I said, if it were merely a matter of crossing some S&amp;T threshold in the three domains. At the moment, I don't know if that is indeed the case.

The edge is already closer, what more is there that you think is insurmountable?  

There doesn't need to be 1:1 equilibrium. The larger group has far more room to maneuver. The pressure to excel is on the smaller group because stakes are higher for them. 

&gt; I also don't quite get this. If my limited reading of history yields anything, it is that, in our context, smaller groups have tended to wrest control over the majority from time to time (be it external - in terms of invaders and colonizers, or internal - as in our social structures [China and India, apparently, share some similarities on this account]).

Those smaller groups wrested control because they had Technological edge (military strategy, superior training of soldiers and a disjointed Indian/Chinese states, happened more to India because India was fighting more internally, the larger group system was not coming to shape in the Indian context in a timely fashion, the Afghan invasions were made on a North India which was not United India, it was already splintered)  

There is no need to make things complex, that is why I used the Species level paradigm. It accounts of everything, be it culture, age, geography, politics, etc.  

Human species is as such that there is no great difference in each other. Its not like Cats which have great variety from Domestic to Tigers, Puma's etc.  

A larger group of this species will therefore Always become dominant over the smaller ones. Because the edges that spring up will be temporary since the Larger group will incorporate/assimilate these edges into its own midst. It will do so because its comprised of the same members of that species having the same intellect to understand/grasp the consequence of what that edge and its subsequent advantages mean.  

Its a biological thing. Its not complex at all. In the long run China and India will dominate, provided they meet the original premise criteria of being the Larger entity, because it doesn't or won't work if its split into 10 smaller countries like they often like to do every 3-4 century or so.

It's not just immigrants, the sheer amount of people that think they know everything about a completely different country so as to argue with a native about it based on a few comments is absurd.

I think this list sums up the general view of certain groups pretty well(of course some might disagree)

Chinese people are all filthy, and lack social conduct

Japanese/South Koreans have no lives/are dronelike slaves under a inefficient inferior work culture, and are xenophobic/sexist/classist/ageist.

Southeast Asians are corrupt and helpless,

Mexicans(Latinos in general) are corrupt(government) but hardworking(people)

Kurds, Christian Arabs, and Assyrians are cool people for fighting back the terrorists, while Jordan, Morocco, and Egypt are at least trying to help out. Sikhs and Buddhists too(except Burmese people) are all cool because they just are.

Every other country in the Middle East is ""bad"" because they either support terrorism(Qatar, Saudi), don't fully cooperate with the US(Iran, Lebanon, Turkey), or commit human rights offenses(every country, but this sub loves poking at Israel especially hard).

Russia and its allies are all blind under a Russian led set of ideals, and must turn to Western interests and values to pick itself back up

Much of NATO are all freeloaders

Indians are dirty and rape is a part of their culture

Arabs are dirty and discrimination is a part of their culture(but they have money so they go free)

Africa is a corrupt shithole with no hope

There are no moderate Muslims, none of them try to reform, Islam is a threat to Europe, and immigrants must be deported

Southern Europeans are lazy bums, Northern Europeans(and parts of Western Europe) are paradise countries.

The RCAF pilots are the first to engage American forces.

Over Ontario, near Ottawa, two CF-18 encounter a F-35. After the F-35 fails to respond, and the RCAF does not get any response from USAF command, the Prime Minister of Canada, with support from the Minister of Defence orders the CF-18s to shoot down the F-35. The CF-18s fire and make the first kill of the war.

The United States President makes a suprise midnight address to the American people. The President anounces the invasion of Canada. Canadian air space is closed to US civlian traffic. US-Canada boarders are closed.

All over Canada missles and bombs target antiaircraft weapons and any RCAF planes still on the ground. A state of emergency is declared across all of Canada. Canadian Forces reserves are called up. All Canadian Forces bases across Canada start mobilizing. Canadian Leopard 2 tanks and LAV IIIs move into cities and other civlian areas. Canadian Forces surround Parliment Hill.

The USAF gains air superority in Western Canada. American ground forces move in. The National Guard from the boarder states take all boarder crossings.

Marines invade Newfoundland, St John's is captured. The Marines invade Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island quickly taking Halifax and Charlottetown. Then Moncton, NewBrunswick. Toronto is captured. The USN sails up the St Lawrence river. Ottawa and Montéal are surrounded. 

The United States vetos every resolution in the UNSC. Many Nations in NATO are to reluctant to declare war. NATO falls apart. Russia annexs eastern Ukraine, Then invades western Ukraine, and the other former Soviet Republics. Western Europe shift their focus from helping Canada to getting ready to defend against a Russian invasion. 

The Royal Canadian Navy makes its final stand in the St Lawrence river, near Québec City. This is the largest naval battle in the war. One USN nuclear submarine, two USN destroyers are sunk. The RCN loses the remainder of its Atlantic fleet. The HMCS Halifax, HMCS Montréal, HMCS Athabaskan, HMCS Victora, and HMCS Windsor are sunk. HMCS Toronto is captured.

With the bulk of the United States Navy fleet in the eastern pacific and the atlantic oceans, and the Amry and Air Force focused on Canada, The Democratic People's Republic of Korea invades the Republic of Korea.

Ballack spent half the time injured and the other half being criticised as lazy and nowhere near as good as he was for Bayern.

And you've missed my entire point which is that it's easy to be a ""well-run club"" when you have unlimited funds and nothing to lose to plug any and every gap you might have in your squad. Simply sell off one of your stockpile of unused backups for £20+m (that's FFP dealt with, why doesn't every club just sell their backups for £20m each?!).

Even with the absurd money you got for David Luiz, Lukaku and Schurrle last summer, you still spent more than you made.

I think another problem is that the left use 'human rights' to justify doing things that they want to do but that they know most people oppose.

Even if we left the EU incidentally we'd still have the same problem. If you replace the Human Rights Act which implements the ECHR in British law with a British Bill of Rights as for example the Conservatives said they'd do before the 2010 election, you'd still have the same problem of activist lawyers stretching the meaning of that Bill of Rights.

What do you mean with ""talent""? Of course the larger states like Austria, Prussia and Saxony and their aristocracy were able and willing to offer artists more than smaller, more plutocratic states could. But I don't think you should base your judgement on who can pay artists more.

The big reason for why Germany wasn't as strong economically as it could have been was that mercantilism was the dominant economic policy until the 19th century. In 1790, Germany still had 1800 customs barriers, which were mostly abolished during the following 60 years. Germany also used different currencies and units, which would not be much of a problem today, but it certainly was 200 years ago.

Once the German states had agreed to cooperate economically and implement certain liberalizations (the end of guilds being a big factor), Germany soared.

I don't think it needed unification for that, in fact all the policies that helped it become an economic power house were already in place before it was unified (and the Empire remained a fairly decentralized state anyway).

And don't forget that millions of ambitious, educated Germans migrated to the Americas in the 19th century. If they had helped build up Germany's economy instead of the USA's, Argentina's, Brazil's, etc., it probably wouldn't have taken as long for Germany to become the dominant state in Europe.",,cp1tbef,False,0,False,1427535638,t3_2xntxi,3,DarkEnlightenment,,t1_cp1tbef,1425306521,t5_2xhxs,,0

0,TychoCelchuuu,11,False,t3_2xnzg6,"As Christopher Morris points out, that's not a good *definition* of the state, and Weber seems to realize this, because he provides a better definition elsewhere:

&gt; Since the concept of the state has only in modern times reached its full development, it is best to define it in terms appropriate tot he modern type of state, but at the same time, in terms which abstract from the values of the present day, since these are particularly subject to change. The primary formal characteristics of the modern state are as follows: It possesses and administrative and legal order subject to change by legislation, to which the organized corporate activity of the administrative staff, which is also regulated by legislation, is oriented. This system of order claims binding authority, not only over the members of the state, the citizens,.... but also to a very large extent, over all actions taking place in the area of its jurisdiction. It is thus a compulsory association with a territorial basis. Furthermore, today, the use of force is regarded as legitimate only so far as it is either permitted by the state or prescribed by it. (*The Theory of Social and Economic Organization* (Part I of *Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft*), trans. A. M. Henderson and T. Parsons (New York: Oxford University Press, 1947), p. 156, quoted in Morris' *An Essay on the Modern State*, p. 44 fn. 80.)

The characterization Morris gives in that book (chapter 2 specifically) I find much more compelling than either of Weber's definitions. It's a complex characterization but in short the five features of a state are continuity in time and place, transcendence (it's something over and above its organizations), political organization (the state's institutions are differentiated from others), authority (the state is sovereign in the Weberian sense, plus a bit more), and allegiance (it expects and receives the loyalty of its members).

If you want to pursue the legitimacy question, see [this article](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/) and [this article](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authority/) but note that even Weber's famous definition is that a state *successfully claims* the monopoly on the legitimate use of force. The state itself *does not* have to exercise legitimate force. The state may be entirely illegitimate. What is important is that it *claims* (successfully) the right to legitimately use force.

Analogously, I might successfully claim the right to legitimately use your car if I convince everyone it's my car, but I might be lying: it's still your car, and every use I make of it is illegitimate.

Let them help you in the process and it'll be easier for everyone involved. Just make sure that you establish your boundaries and that they are aware of them and that they respect them.

Catherine was a political figure and politics was even rougher and nastier then than it is now. She was also a woman. What this TIL takes as a fact were actually crazy, sexist accusations made by the opposition, which arguably were never intended to be taken literally.

I can only confirm this. But I think the truly bizare twist here is that while these statements were, at the time, meant to defame her character. Times however have changed, and so has the view of sexuality in this maner.

So these days if people recognize the name Catherine di Medici,  it will be connection with some story about fictional spying whores. Which is truly sad considering Catherine di Medici was one of european history's most brutal and terrifying women, who made Cersei Lannister seem sane.

Catherine di Medici was one of the main instigators of the [St. Bartholomew's day massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre) where thousands of french protestants got slaughtered. She is also suspected to have been behind a number of assassinations and attempted assassinations of prominent protestants and political leaders. She probably was involved in more bloodshed than all other queens of her day put together.

And what do people remeber her for? False satirical claims of sex spying.

0,ttoasty,5,False,t3_2xmoh1,"&gt;connections to the global economy

A state that seceded would not have any connections to the global economy.  States aren't allowed to conduct their own diplomacy, and only limited experience in directly engaging in global business and the like.  They would be starting from scratch.  The would also run into some problems while engaging with some of the big players in the global economy.  Like China, who I doubt would recognize a state that seceded from the US.  Or, the US, who probably wouldn't be very happy about the secession.  The new nation would likely be fairly isolated, unless it managed to ride the US's coattail.  There's a point where that dependency makes the original secession look pretty ridiculous, though.

Also, not every state has a ""productive, educated workforce."" Imagine if Mississippi seceded.  They're already lacking on industry, and they rank at the bottom of the states for education.  They'll have the same problems attracting industry as a nation that they do as a state.  The same thing could probably be said for at least 10 or 15 states.

&gt; it's difficult to imagine that all economic activity will simply cease or dry up.

Perhaps not all economic activity, but I'd wager the most important economic activity (industry, large corporations, financial institutions, etc.) would leave.  First, secession would cut them off from funding.  Banks are no longer part of the Fed, which means their supply of money is cut off.  That makes domestic capital hard to come by, meaning businesses would still be reliant on the now foreign US financial industry for money.  Also, they lose the stability found in the US dollar.  There's no way the nation of Wyoming will have a currency anywhere near as strong as the globally dominant currency.  The loss of the USD alone is probably enough to make most companies move.  Corporations are also beholden to their investors, who are mostly foreign now.

&gt;Smaller states could take advantage of their proximity to the United States to attract global investment without the full range of taxes and duties levied in the U.S.

While this might attract some businesses and all, it's unlikely that the lower taxes would be more appealing than all the cons I listed above.  The comparison just can't be made with small European states that all use the Euro.  Larger states run into their own problem, too.  They may have far bigger economies that are more likely to be self-sustaining, but they're also heavily connected to the rest of the US.  New York City is the financial hub of the US, for example, but that won't help them if New York secedes.  California is one of the top agricultural producers in the US, but we could probably get produce cheaper abroad if we didn't have to protect domestic industry anymore.

For 2, I assume you mean something similar to what the EU has?  That would probably work, but the new nation is unlikely able to match its border security to that of the US, as I described.  There would have to be heavy involvement from the US, which is just another example of the dependency this seceded state would continue to have.

3, I don't really agree.  Self-determination was a concept that first gain traction around WWI in regards to the Balkans in particular.  It involved ethnic groups that had no say or democracy within their country.  Secession from a country when you already have democracy, when you're not an oppressed or disenfranchised ethnic group, etc., doesn't seem much like self-determination to me.

&gt; As an example, I'm British and we recently had a referendum in Scotland for independence.

Which is not a very good comparison.  Scotland is far different than a US state.  It has historical, cultural, and ethnic (?) differences from the rest of the UK.  It has a history of being treated poorly by the UK.  The rather unique ""united kingdoms"" aspect of the UK has left Scotland with rather developed political and governmental institutions outside of the larger UK system (as I understand it, anyways).  And, very importantly, Scotland would have access to the entire EU and their currency, should they choose to adopt it, making it far less isolationist from the get-go.  I imagine for many businesses, the transition to an independent Scotland would not be that different than if the UK switched to the Euro.  But that may be a bold statement, given how little I know about the situation.

&gt;I recognise that those pushing for independence were often motivated out of a desire to effect positive change for their communities.

You should read up on the calls for Texas independence from a few years back.  The intention wasn't positive change, it was a fear of change combined with divisive partisan politics.

&gt; If people think the national/federal government is unsuited to adequately represent their region, that's a perfectly legitimate political opinion.

The federal government gives every state literally the same representation: two senators and a number of representatives proportional to population.

The fact that you are willing to accept bribes to help destroy the planet shows your lack of morality or ethics.

&gt; So you want to force people to stop eating meat. How does one do that in any fashion that isn't immoral and illegal? 

It would be immoral to allow eating meat and destruction of the biosphere.

Arguably meat eating is already a crime under ecocide laws which are increasingly internationally recognized.

But in any case, why would be it be illegal to ban meat? We just pass a clear law banning it, both at the international level (UN, EU, etc)., and in national parliaments.

&gt; Would there be any exceptions whatsoever, or does everybody everywhere go 100% meat-free? 

Why would there be exceptions?  There are no exceptions for murder or rape (even though they are part of traditional culture among US Republicans).

&gt; Eskimos eat almost exclusively meat and fish at least during the winter--do they get an exception for their culture?

So do Americans....

Why would there be exceptions?

We would gradually return to the traditional human culture: small groups of vegan hunter-gatherers.

&gt; I'm very curious about this proposal and how one might go about enforcing it.

How do you go about enforcing any law? That's what the police and courts are for.

&gt; First, secession would be an attack on US sovereignty the same as an invasion or occupation. Land is being taken away from the state. There's nothing cordial or stabilizing to come of that, especially in a geopolitical sense.

These are political affiliations - lines on a map. I'm not that old, but I am old enough to remember when there were states called Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia and no such state as Eritrea. Now it is not that way. What was oh-so-destabilizing in the manner of an invasion?

&gt; Imagine if Tennessee seceded. It's completely surrounded by the US.

Ever heard of Switzerland or Austria? How about Luxembourg?

&gt; Truck routes from Dallas to the East Coast have to be rerouted because they can no longer easily use Tennessee interstates (built with US federal funding!). 

How do you think trade happens in Europe? You should play Euro Truck Simulator.

&gt; The nation of Tennessee doesn't have billions to spend on the TSA or NSA or CIA and other 3 letter agencies. All it takes is for the Memphis airport to go international and now there's a weak point in US security.

No one will attack an independent Tennessee for the same reason they don't attack Canada and the same reason no one attacks North Korea.

&gt; closely share US intelligence data with them to stop suspected terrorists, etc. But that, again, is a fiscal drain on the US.

The US already does this with Canada and other allies.

&gt;When has a UK citizen sued the UK government following the removal of benefits

You're backpedalling a lot here.  This isn't about removal of *benefits*, but of failing to live up to a promised exchange.  As it happens, no, I'm not aware of any such suits, which isn't surprising given that I'm not aware of any government so stupid as to actually **do** this.  They avoid retroactive changes like the plague, for good reason, hence why the changes they make to pensions going forward are all staged based on date of birth.

&gt;You're obviously keen to raise taxes

Not particularly, I just think it's a **far** better approach than your proposal in pretty much every conceivable way.  It accomplishes the same ends without a huge violation of governmental trust, would raise more with less upset and wastage, and would target the rich in general rather than just a particular subset that you deem worthy of having their contributions confiscated just because they're old.

&gt;If it makes you feel any better let's institute a tax on income from state pensions

Again, why?  Why victimise the old and wealthy in preference to everyone who is wealthy?  This all amounts to exactly the same issues - it just makes it even more clear that your policy is all about targetting the old in particular, rather than just the wealthy.

&gt;It most certainly is free money

I'm failing to see how they got this money for free, when they've spent their whole lifetime paying for it.  They may get out more than they put in (or at least, would if you don't pinch it off them), but that's still something they've paid for.  The same applies to my savings account after all, but that money wasn't free.  And once you take that money, they've contributed a substantial sum for absolutely no gain - I find it hard to see how you could interpret that as free.  Free means it didn't actually cost them anything to get.

&gt;Pensioners ""lifetime of contributions"" doesn't come close to covering the cost of the state pension. It's free money we're handing out. Financed by the taxpayer. 

For the rich, it certainly did.  They've contributed more than their share.  If this is the basis, you ought to be giving those a refund, and only confiscating the pensions of the poor. ",,cp1vgky,False,0,False,1427536638,t1_cp1u0td,1,unitedkingdom,,t1_cp1vgky,1425311094,t5_2qhqb,,0

Hvis vi tager tilfældet med Netflix der skulle betale mere for at ikke få deres hastighed throttled, syntes jeg det 100% fair at folk der bruger mere af trafikken også betaler en højere pris. Forstår ikke hvorfor folk er så meget imod det. Hvis folk gerne vil have ISPer opholder netneutralitet vil der også være udbydere der sælger sig selv på den måde (Google Fiber, afaik), men at sige at de SKAL sælge deres service på den måde syntes jeg ikke er i orden.

Så en anden kommentar (har ikke læst det) i den her thread nævne at EU har indført stærke Netneutralitets regler i 2014, men i alt den tid jeg har haft internet har jeg ikke kunne se et problem på området, der gør at de regler var nød til at være der.

**Name:** СИЛА (Strength)

**Alcohol Content:** 8.0%

**Price:** 25 uah (~$1 US)

**Rating:** 8/10

**Notes:** Lviv's Pravda Beer Theatre beer commemorates the [Second Battle of Donetsk Airport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Donetsk_Airport) with a beer called ""Strength."" The label of the beer gives short description of the battle, making it out to be a sort of Ukrainian Alamo, a sign of Ukraine's strength and mental toughness. 

I asked the saleman what the purpose of the beer was. ""Because the brewery wanted to."" He said, ""This is a symbol of the situation currently happening in the east of our country. It's a sort of patriotism.""

The beer does give off the sense of rebellion and Ukrainian patriotism found in the country today. While proceeds from the sale of the beer don't go to the army, a donation box is conveniently set up just next to the cash desk in the brewery. And, from the looks of it, people are very eager to make donations.

**Bottle Text:**

&gt;Airport tower in Donetsk was under the siege of the Russian terrorists for 242 days. Ukrainian soldiers who bravely defended it were called ""cyborgs"". Siege and battles at Donetsk Airport became a symbol of moral courage of Ukrainians in stopping Russian terrorism in Europe.
&gt;
&gt;Russia attacked Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014 breaking postwar peaceful order on the continent.

**Bonus:** The brewery also sells a beer called ""[СВЯТО](http://imgur.com/a/BJRRV)"" (~~Sacred~~ Holiday) in honor of theatre director Roman Viktyuk.

There are people who have lived in the region for decades who have raised families there and love living in the UAE that deserve citizenship more than anyone else. Expats are allowed to buy property in the UAE, but they can never own it, because it will always be at risk of being confiscated by the government. Imagine pouring your life's work into buying a house, raising your family, and sending them to school in a country where in the blink of an eye, everything you worked for and loved could be stripped of you. Not only is it not fair, its criminal, and that is exactly the scenario that exists in the UAE.

Its a myth to think that the local language and culture would be lost. Emirati journalist Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi stated,

&gt;Should the UAE decide to naturalise say 1,000 people a year, on average it would take **around 900 years** for the naturalised population to outstrip UAE citizens (at zero growth rate for each side).

I suggest you read the entire **[article here](http://gulfnews.com/opinions/columnists/give-expats-an-opportunity-to-earn-uae-citizenship-1.1234167)**.

If you want to maintain the linguistic and cultural integrity of the UAE, then either give people citizenship by making them take language tests and help them immerse themselves into the culture and history of the region. I promise you, there are quite a few people who are more than willing to do that to continue living in a country they've grown to love.

Frankly, I don't understand this ethnocentrism that exists in many Arabs who live and work in the UAE. The West in general has been able to move on (for the most part) from this perspective, and actually take in immigrants on a regular basis, most of whom become functioning members of society and assimilate well into the culture while bringing their own flavor to the cultural makeup of the country they move to (unless you're talking to right wing Europeans).

2) There are currently five servers per region: one gold server that is subscription based for a curated RP experience and four servers that are F2P.  There are plans to have an additional F2P server that would be considered 'hardcore', but there's very little information about them right now.  Current regions are North America and Europe.. don't think there are plans for more.
&amp;nbsp;

3a) [Yes](https://www.revivalgame.com/philosophy/monetization), houses will always be on sale for money - the real estate listings are a big part of the 'cash store' for this game. 
&amp;nbsp;

3b) Yes... and no.
There are a finite number of addresses in the game because each represents a 'physical' location in a static city.  Only so much room, so only so many buildings...  so *yes*, someone could technically sit down with tens of thousands of dollars and buy up all the dwellings.  

But also *no*, because they will have only bought up all the dwellings in *Crown's Rock*.  Crown's Rock is the only city available currently, but there are already plans to release many more.  So if you waited and didn't buy in now you might have a hard time buying a place in Crown's Rock, but there will almost assuredly be many listings available in newer towns.  Remember, real estate listings are a hefty part of the 'cash store' for this F2P game, so the devs have incentive to expand the map and create compelling dwellings in fascinatin' new spaces.

You might not even want a place in Crown's Rock long after release anyway; that place is for newbs! Maybe even far away from the more current content you want to see.

5) The first blog/forum posts start up in November '14, and they started up the store for founders a couple weeks ago.  So pretty new; hard to tell how fast/slow things are going development-wise. Many pictures for houses, not so much for character models/abilities/ui, which jives with the [schedule](https://www.revivalgame.com/?navbar=2#panel_5).
&amp;nbsp;

The devs are *very* active on the [forums](https://www.revivalgame.com/forum), and it's great.  While the main website is pretty sparse with gameplay details, the devs have been active in trading feedback on game design ideas in forum discussions.  Reading the posts, you feel about as informed as you can be for a prealpha, and [XDem4's dev tracker](https://www.reddit.com/r/RevivalGame/comments/2wzrp3/unofficial_revival_devtracker_comments_welcome/) can help with that.  Also, there's an IRC channel for founders and devs that I haven't checked out yet myself.

The very important thing to remember as well is that portraiture is of a real person, often painted because they wanted a portrait done regardless of their level of attractiveness or because the artist thought they represented a character well. Just because the artist thought them attractive or appropriate does not tell us the general public opinion (which is going to vary person to person greatly). It's easier to look at fashions to see what is accented and augmented. Certain time periods like the late 16th century, 1780s, or 1880s accent the backside by way of bum rolls, false rumps, or later bustles. The 1810s have a column shape of gown, but the bust is set very high and round with low necklines. Big sleeves in the 1830s, 1890s, and 1980s? Looks like a smaller waist in comparison (and neck even). Expansion, augmentation, or exposure of certain areas of clothing tells us a lot about a time periods perfect silhouette or focus areas. Cathy Hay, a fashion historian, just did a great post [talking about how the extreme silhouettes of the 1900s were created](http://thepeacockdress.com/2015/02/the-edwardian-silhouette-emerges/) and this is a perfect example of ratio over actual size.",Fashion/Textile History,cp1xsyt,False,0,False,1427537731,t3_2xo3ec,26,AskHistorians,art,t1_cp1xsyt,1425315246,t5_2ssp3,,0

To me this is what negative interest rates and people's reactions to them feel like. It is so absurd that ""what I'm seeing I can't be seeing"" is everyone's collective reaction.

To be clear, what negative interest rates objectively mean is that there are no worthwhile investments for the bulk of European capital. Europe isn't a poor, backwater, isolated region with an inability to invest anywhere on the globe. If Europe collectively can't find a place to invest, that means that *Capital* is starting to falter as a catalyst for growth.

I don't think this means an end to Markets and Capitalism. But this might be signalling a new chapter in our economic history.

To my mind it means that the globe has perhaps reached what one might cheekily call 'peak capital'. 

I think the article even has the seeds as to why this is the case. The person who got the negative loan, wanted it to create a website to improve their business. 

I think it is turning out that a lot of modern businesses aren't as capital intensive as their predecessors were. Businesses just don't need as much 'working capital' for inventory, floor space, hiring workers, etc as used to be the case.

This is an odd dynamic that I don't think gets enough attention. It isn't that businesses or the economy is dead, it is simply that having money is no longer enough, in itself, to make more money, as it has been for hundreds (thousands?) of years.

It's funny that while so many are starting to be concerned about the beginning of a possible 'crisis' of unemployment, due to technological advancement, the same forces are in plain sight rendering capital just as valueless. 

Makes one wonder if in the future there will be a drive for 'unemployed capital insurance'. :)

The healthcare isn't great, but I certainly never wanted for anything. A few injuries probably warranted some kind of opiate rather than their favorite script, Ibuprofen 800mg, but overall, I wanted for nothing healthcare-wise. Got my vaccinations with an annual YOU WILL FUCKING DO THIS reminder.

I was stationed in Europe, so I got a $300/month cost of living allowance, except it was way over the cost of living difference. Any wacky European taxes for things like city tax, TV tax, and road tax (""tabs or tags"" in the US) were reimbursed in full. My BAH as a single male was almost $1,400/month.

Went to training in Texas. Per diem was $72 per day for food and incidentals. $72 allowed me to eat out EVERY MEAL and paid for my alcohol. I still put money in my pocket on that deal.

I got 30 days off per year, and the average American is guaranteed ZERO days off per year, including ALL national holidays. I could even roll my leave over and save up to 75 fucking days.

What can you do about it?  In all fairness, probably nothing.  Moving datacenters is an extremely expensive proposition.  Worse yet, they may already be in the best location they can be.  Moving elsewhere may just shift the problems to a different group of customers because of shitty ISPs in other locations.  Since you can't pick the route you end up taking, you may still be routed through the network that's wrecking your latency and dropping packets even if the datacenter got moved if it's sufficiently far up the chain.

It simply can't be malfunctioning equipment, as that would have been repaired or replaced long ago due to causing lost business.  It's an ISP that has decided that gaming traffic is less important than all the rest.  The only thing that would provoke a change is for the ISP that's the cause of all of this to start losing a significant amount of money.  That is unlikely to happen because they probably carry a bunch of other traffic and don't apply shaping rules to it to de-prioritize other customers' traffic.

You root for players from places very far awar, that get paid by people from other far away places, with money from other far away places. The only reason you pull for those teams is that they happen to play there. The players made a choice to go there mostly for money, particularly foreigners. No doubt they are passionate about the team they play for, but they are passionate because of their professional drive, not because of the love of the club. Sure they might eventually love the club, but it's an acquired taste.I doubt Coutinho or Aguero dreamt of playing for the clubs they currently play (although clearly more likely Coutinho might have dreamt of playing for Liverpool, but unlikely) but you can sure as hell be certain they dreamt of playing for Brazil and Argentina respectively. And players mostly get out of internationals for friendlies, not for important internationals in qualifiers or the actual tournaments. 

I am the person who wishes that club football  across the world was regulated in such a way that teams must have a high number of academy products from the local area in their team. Because if it's not about producing local talents, it becomes about having deeper pockets. Eventually City will get it right and they'll win the CL, Chelsea did it. But how many of those players are passionate about the club because it's their club, and nothing else? They are passionate because they play for the club and are professionals, but they can't have the same passion of Totti, Gerrard, Puyol, Xavi, Terry etc... guys who only played for one shirt. International football has that, all players play for only one shirt once they play an official game (I think friendlies should count as well.)

Look I dislike nationalism and patriotism for the most part, but in football I find it fun, and nothing brings the world together like a World Cup, its incredible. The qualifiers starting 3 years earlier with over 200 nations taking a shot at it, even if very remote. 

Maybe it's because I come from a smaller country in Honduras were our only chance of being represented at the highest stage is through out national team, our clubs can't quite play the CL, and the Club World Cup isn't taken too seriously by Europeans. 

I like that football should be local. You should be able to watch your team in person every two weeks, you should be able to go watch a practice, you should have people from your city playing in your club. That's how I feel, because it makes football global. Everyone can have a team, everyone can be represented, and anyone could develop the best players in the world and become great, regardless of money.

Adding to /u/BrianFlanagan 's fantastic answer, it is worthwhile to consider the broader picture of Europe at that time. 

The reign of Henry VIII coincided with the rise of Charles V of HRE and Spain (and of Italy, of the Low Countries, etc. etc. etc.); and the rise of Francis I of France. It should be noted that both fought for HRE emperorship, a contest that was won by Charles V albeit at a high price. This started a lifelong rivalry between the Habsburgs and the Valois. 

Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Isabella and Ferdinand the Catholic Monarchs of Spain (or more precisely, or Castille-Leon and Aragon), was political. She was originally betrothed to Prince Arthur the older brother and heir to the English throne. When Arthur died, the 11-year old Henry was promised to her, partly so that the English won't have to return the dowry already partially paid. A papal dispensation from Julius II was obtained in support of Catherine's claim that her previous marriage was unconsummated. 

When Henry ascended to the throne in 1509, he allied England with the Habsburgs, joining in the anti-French Holy League founded by Pope Julius II, and even invaded France alongside Spanish troops in both Aquitaine  and Nord-Pas-Calais. Neither amounted to significant progress, so when Charles V's troops captured Francis I of France in the Battle of Pavia, he forced a treaty that didn't confer much benefit to England. Henry VIII was unhappy at the outcome. 

At the same time, as mentioned, Henry VIII was very concerned with the security of succession in England. He started to have affairs with the Boleyn sisters, and was infatuated with Anne Boleyn. As mentioned, we know that up to the early 1520s he was still quite the devout Catholic, having a good relation with Pope Leo X who named him ""Defender of the Faith."" 

However, the next few popes made relations with England complicated. Adrian VI, also known as Adrian of Utrecht, had been tutor to the young Charles V and even administered Spain in Charles V's absence. Leo X was a short-lived compromise pope. Clement VII was Charles V's chosen candidate, even if his reign was a turbulent period in Italy due to Francis I's invasion of Milan and northern Italy. 

When Henry tried to obtain an annulment from Clement VII in 1527, it was at a very complicated time. Charles V's commanders in Rome had lost control of unpaid troops, who then looted Rome. Clement VII was imprisoned for several months. Regardless, Clement VII refused Henry VIII's two main points of argument: (1) a childless marriage was sign that it was blighted by God, and (2) his marriage had required dispensation in the first place, so therefore arguments could be made it was not valid. 

A key change in Henry VIII's favor was installment of Thomas Cranmer, a close friend of the Boleyn family, as Archbishop of Canterbury. Henry VIII made it such that Cranmer was consecrated without taking an oath of loyalty to the Pope; thus, Cranmer could immediately grant the annulment Henry VIII sought. This set the stage for the ""Reform from the top"" that was mentioned. ",,cp1z7bw,False,0,False,1427538385,t3_2xl25b,8,AskHistorians,,t1_cp1z7bw,1425317572,t5_2ssp3,,0

0,catastematic,3,False,t3_2xnwei,"Evil has many meanings, but the primary meaning in these contexts is (1) someone is doing something that is morally bad, (2) they are doing the morally bad thing because they are following a morally bad rule, (3) they are following the morally bad rule not out of oversight or ignorance but as a conscious, deliberate choice.

The first consideration differentiates ISIS soldiers from, say, political cartoonists: burning Christians alive is a bad thing, drawing pictures is not. The second consideration differentiates ISIS soldiers from, say, a typical member of the Wehrmacht, or of the Russian Army in 2015: it is bad to take part in an aggressive war of territorial expansion for any reason, but it is reasonable to volunteer or accept conscription into your nation's army and follow orders from your sergeant, whereas it is unreasonable to burn Christians alive because they are Christians and you want them to be Muslims. The third consideration differentiates people who are ignorant, or under duress, or in a ""everyone else is doing it"" situation from ISIS members, many of whom are European nationals. Even if ISIS were a purely local phenomenon, no one else has been waging war in such a brutal way in the region.

I understand the description of evil (or even good) people as ""monstrous"" or ""inhuman"" as a more technical point about overcoming the natural aversion to (i) seeing others suffer, (ii) hurting the innocent, (iii) disgusting forms of violence. So for example, using chemical weapons in war might be evil regardless, but chemical weapons that cause people to vomit out bloodied lung-bits are monstrous, whereas a chemical weapon that caused a sudden painless death would be evil but humane. In general more physical and more bloody forms of death are more monstrous. So killing civilians for any reason is monstrous; killing them intentionally, more so; killing them with fire or by hacking them to pieces, maximally so.

So (for example) you might be able to argue that the Mongol horde was as good or more good than the bomber crews that bombed Japan, but putting the inhabitants of a city to death by chopping them up, one at a time, is definitely more monstrous than dropping bombs on them, because the bomber crews may still have humane impulses that the Mongols couldn't have retained.",18Δ,cp1zrtq,False,0,False,1427538650,t3_2xnwei,3,changemyview,,t1_cp1zrtq,1425318512,t5_2w2s8,,0

There are four main reasons why I still work:

* My work provides a good work/life balance and isn't tedious.  I also genuinely believe it does good in the world.  It also pays decently and provides a pension which grows the longer I work there. 

* One of the things my parents did for me was allow to go to college without going into debt.  Now that I have a family, I want to do the same for my children, and I want them to be able to do it for their children, etc.  There was a thread about this last week talking about generational FI.  I want FI that will last beyond my own self.

* I am pretty fiscally conservative in that I want a big safety net so that even if something calamitous happens I will know my family will be ok

* I want my children to have cool experiences growing up.  And I don't mean material things... but I want them to understand the concept what old means in Europe vs the US, learn about the Maori's in New Zealand and how they were just about the only natives who were able to not be subjugated by Europeans, experience the craziness of Akihabara, see the Pyramids of Egypt, see penguins in Antartica, etc. We probably won't be able to hit everything on that list, but I want to instill in them the hunger to experience the world around them and learn that the world is more than their neighborhood or city.

Sometimes when people think about FI they think it's a binary thing.  Either you are FI or you aren't.  I look at FI more as a spectrum.  FI starts when you don't have to work anymore and can get by.  Near the other end of the spectrum is FI where you can buy a $200M yacht and afford that $20M/year upkeep on it.

Essentially, such arguments as yours only work when we look on a gene-by-gene basis, or at a small number of polymorphisms. However, as the number of points of comparison increase, the clustering becomes stronger, to the point where individuals can be classified with near-perfect reliability. Relevant quote from Wikipedia:

&gt;Edwards argued that while Lewontin's statements on variability are correct when examining the frequency of different alleles (variants of a particular gene) at an individual locus (the location of a particular gene) between individuals, it is nonetheless possible to classify individuals into different racial groups with an accuracy that approaches 100 percent when one takes into account the frequency of the alleles at several loci at the same time. This happens because differences in the frequency of alleles at different loci are correlated across populations — the alleles that are more frequent in a population at two or more loci are correlated when we consider the two populations simultaneously. Or in other words, the frequency of the alleles tends to cluster differently for different populations.

More recently:

&gt;In the 2007 paper ""Genetic Similarities Within and Between Human Populations"", Witherspoon et al. attempt to answer the question, ""How often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations?"". The answer depends on the number of polymorphisms used to define that dissimilarity, and the populations being compared. When they analysed three geographically distinct populations (European, African and East Asian) and measured genetic similarity over many thousands of loci, the answer to their question was ""never"". However, measuring similarity using smaller numbers of loci yielded substantial overlap between these populations. Rates of between-population similarity also increased when geographically intermediate and admixed populations were included in the analysis.",,cp21oia,False,0,False,1427539610,t1_cp1koxw,0,EverythingScience,,t1_cp21oia,1425321565,t5_2zlwp,,0

&gt; Communism also failed because the steps it took to reach it were highly inefficient when compared to Capitalism.

I am happy to inform you that that is straight-up propaganda. :)

&gt; From the moment in 1928 that the Soviet economy became publicly owned and planned, to the point in 1989 that the economy was pushed in a free market direction, Soviet GDP per capita growth exceeded that of all other countries but Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. GDP per person grew by a factor of 5.2, compared to 4.0 for Western Europe and 3.3 for the Western European offshoots (the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) (Allen, 2003). In other words, over the period in which its publicly owned, planned economy was in place, the USSR‘s record in raising incomes was better than that of the major industrialized capitalist countries. The Soviet Union’s robust growth over this period is all the more impressive considering that the period includes the war years when a major assault by Nazi Germany left a trail of utter destruction in its wake. The German invaders destroyed over 1,500 cities and towns, along with 70,000 villages, 31,000 factories, and nearly 100 million head of livestock (Leffler, 1994). Growth was highest to 1970, at which point expansion of the Soviet economy began to slow. However, even during this so-called (and misnamed) post-1970 period of stagnation, GDP per capita grew 27 percent (Allen, 2003).

&gt; While Soviet GDP per capita growth rates compare favorably with those of the major capitalist economies, a more relevant comparison is with the rest of the world. In 1928, the Soviet Union was still largely an agrarian country, and most people worked in agriculture, compared to a minority in Western Europe and North America. Hence, the economy of the USSR at the point of its transition to public ownership and planning was very different from that of the industrialized Western capitalist countries. On the other hand, the rest of the world resembled the Soviet Union in also being largely agrarian (Allen, 2003). It is therefore the rest of the world, not the United States and other advanced industrialized countries, with which the USSR should be compared. From 1928 to 1989, Soviet GDP per capita not only exceeded growth in the rich countries but exceeded growth in all other regions of the world combined, and to a greater degree. Hence, not only did the publicly owned, planned economy of the Soviet Union outpace the economies of richer capitalist economies, it grew even faster than the economies of countries that were most like the USSR in 1928. For example, outside its southern core, Latin America’s GDP per capita was $1,332 (1990 US dollars), almost equal to the USSR’s $1,370. By 1989, the Latin American figure had reached $4,886, but average income in the Soviet Union had climbed far higher, to $7,078 (Allen, 2003). Public ownership and planning had raised living standards to a higher level than capitalism had in Latin America, despite an equal starting point. Moreover, while the Soviet peacetime economy unfailingly expanded, the Latin American economy grew in fits and starts, with enterprises regularly shuttering their doors and laying off employees.

**You said..**

&gt; communism like capitalism are both modernist socio-political ideologies that require the use and extraction of fossil fuels to develop the system

This is silly. A planned economy can consciously move to make ""unprofitable"" decisions to invest heavily in things that won't pay off for many years, including a fully sustainable economy. Capitalism simply cannot do this. 

The idea that socialism has an ideological commitment to using fossil fuels is one of the sillier claims I've heard in quite a while, and I hear a lot of silly ones about socialism. Since it's quite obvious that the world is going to hell if we don't solve climate change, other environmental disasters, and the coming resource shortages, an ideology whose primary commitment is to the welfare of all people (socialism) has all the reason in the world to focus on these issues, especially given that the primary location of communists in the world is the poorest and most oppressed regions, which will be the first to be affected by climate change, and so the communists will very much have the urgent need for a solution to that problem on their minds.",,cp221gc,False,0,False,1427539778,t1_cp20et6,1,collapse,,t1_cp221gc,1425322136,t5_2qhw9,,0

&gt;People practically cheered when they released the next edition with the very same offensive speech.

We did. But was it not cheering the perseverance of the magazine? To keep doing exactly what they were doing in the face of murderous evil? If they had stopped, doesn't that set a very dangerous precedent? 

I'd like to think that a moderate Muslim would understand the importance of not caving into the demands of madmen. That their point of view might seem ridiculous to someone else, and that that person's opinion need not affect them at all. 

I think that's what it comes down to for me here. I'm not of the mindset that ""offending"" somebody is an issue, because that person can just ignore me. I get offended all the time by things I hear and read but that doesn't give me any special privilege. That's what's beautiful and so tremendously important about free speech. *Everybody* gets to say *all* the horrible shit they want. Equal-opportunity political insensitivity.

I don't think any group of people should be exempt from lampooning. I should stop using a tasteless cartoon to back me up, but South park later did an episode where a group of celebrities led by a disgruntled Tom Cruise attempted to kidnap a fully-censored Muhammed in order to steal his powers of being ""immune to ridicule.""

* [The US Military bombed 10,000 striking coal miners in West Virginia in 1921](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain), where anti-Union agents ""drove a heavily armored train through a tent colony at night, opening fire on women, men, and children with a machine gun.""

* [In 1911 the US broke up the largest company in history owned by the wealthiest man in history, citing a landmark anti-trust act.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil_Co._of_New_Jersey_v._United_States) If Standard Oil was still around today, they would control over 90% of the US energy market and would have assets well in excess of $2 Trillion. Keep this in mind when you hear people talk about how corporations control the government. 

* [The US Fed fought a war against Brigham Young and the Mormons in Utah over the issue of sovereignty in 1857.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_War) It was resolved when the Mormons agreed to operate under US laws in exchange for not being charged with sedition. The vast majority of Mormons in the US still live in Utah.

You answered why there is a disproportionate amount learning English for leaving.

&gt; I don't see that sort of motive from my Western European students, who primarily want English for business opportunities in their own country, or because they just want to chat with foreigners.

Such opportunities aren't as plentiful in Eastern Europe so that proportion of students aren't going to be in there in the first place.

0,Freiling,8,False,t3_2xnp1d,"&gt;there's a big difference between fiction and reality.

In a society oversaturated with media, in which media consumption often replaces social interactions, that difference is more and more blurred. Even when we are conscious that media messages aren't accurate representations of reality, they do train us incrementally to accept the thought processes behind them. If you see the same message enough, it will drill into your brain, despite your conscious ""suspension of disbelief.""

&gt;Fiction vs reality... if you can't tell it apart; you've got a problem.

Or, you're a teenager. Horror movies are more obviously unrealistic, but when you depict a relationship developing between two people, it takes more and more experience to filter it out as bullshit. Many of my friends are in the BDSM scene, and they're seeing a strong misunderstanding in mainstream culture due to FSOG. Even if it's not reality, it can often be the only exposure the mainstream gets of a subculture. 

 &gt; And what about games, and people claiming they promote violence? Next thing you know, the most violent game you'd be able to find would be golf.

I've *heard* that some research says that the major block to training a soldier to kill is breaking down his humanization of the enemy. One of the ways the US Military is addressing this is by using video games for training. ""The neurons that fire together wire together,"" and this goes as well for killing without hesitation. As for how that relates to rape culture, I don't understand it too well myself. But hopefully that helps with the violence thing. Oh, and supposedly violent video games do encourage more violence in children exposed to them. Detractors are supposedly defending their drug of choice. I'm not well-read on this, so obviously take it with a grain of salt and do your own research if you're interested. But if it's between psychology experts and avid gamers, I'll take the word of the former.

&gt; If you do it because of some kind of pressure, then you probably need help (and I mean that in the best way possible, as in advice/suggestions how to change that), because that sounds somewhat weak-minded, as in giving in to what others want, instead of what you want.

There's a common theme in your post of subscribing to the Western myth of independence from social influence and objectivity. As a WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) white male, I previously subscribed to these ideas as well, but I've moved away from them as I broadened my experience. Lo and behold, who taught me the myths of independence and objectivity? My peers and cultural milieu! Fucking ironic.

&gt;women care about how they look even after they die

If you received messages from society that your worth is determined mainly on your appearance, you might understand this.

&gt;Then there was a poster asking whether it's wrong that she prefers being friends with men, and a bunch of comments (not all) saying yes, and how women are taught to hate each other[...] But again, how is that misogynistic ? It's simply a preference.

The only way I could see this is that the Western world tends to esteem traditionally male traits, especially in the US, but to a lesser degree in Europe. You hear these sentiments from women even more here, and there's a lot more angst about not being ""manly enough"" from men and women. It's bizarre, but something to work past. As for the person asking that question herself, I don't think *she's* making a misogynistic choice, as she can't force her preferences. But the forces at play determining her preferences are misogynistic.

Sorry if this post comes off as combative, that's not my intent. Good on you for asking questions with genuine interest.",,cp22ynm,False,0,False,1427540208,t3_2xnp1d,8,AskFeminists,,t1_cp22ynm,1425323612,t5_2sode,,0

Way too late. I think you know why. 

&gt;From what I've heard the Ukraine has treated the east very poorly and not invested a lot of resources into it and this has caused the revolt.. 

Thats a factor, but there has always been a cultural divide between the east and the west/central. Someone put it like this: Western Ukraine is middle class and nationalistic, Eastern Ukraine is lower class and nostalgic for Soviet times. This war was bound to happen, Russia just pushed the last domino over. The constant instability and political crisis in Ukraine has led Ukraine to be probably the most unstable European country, only a little more stable than Iraq.

You're asking where Palestinians came from? Well, they've merely lived there for a couple thousand years or so. Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD, then around 60 years later Jews were completely banned from living there by Hadrian. Arabs, and other peoples lived there for a minimum of 1750 years consecutively before any Jewish claims to the land were made. That's over 7 US histories in length, for point of reference. Then came the waves of Jewish immigrants in the last 100 years or so.

&gt; Palestinians are wrong in that they took someone else's land like..finders keepers...wtf?

Firstly, it's not nearly that simple, but if it were to be spelled out as close to black and white as possible, it would pretty much be the opposite. A very popular view is that Jews have been stealing Arab land for the last 100+ years. I'm not sure how you managed to think Palestinians took anyone's land. If you're going to get upset over Jews losing the Levant, look to the Romans circa 70 AD. Again though, it's not even remotely that simple.

The British Mandate didn't come close to what you're presuming. If anything, the mandate created Israel. It specifically designated a home for the Jewish people amongst the majority of Arab Palestinians.

You also don't seem to understand that Jewish refugee ""land"" wasn't in the middle east, they *went* to the middle east. Many Jewish refugees were displaced by Nazism in Europe, and fled to Palestine where they began to settle on Palestinian land. Again, this is the broadest simplification imaginable, but it's to point out how backward your thinking is.

Based on your comment: ""Length (kind of a deal breaker question for me): 250+ pages"" ...it seems as if you're not real into reading. That's going to be a pretty big problem, and could be why you've been so grossly miseducated.

On a related note, it's probably a good idea to refrain from forming opinions without being even remotely educated on the subject. I'm having a hard time imagining a more polarizing subject than Israeli-Palestinian relations, (maybe abortion) and you seem to be picking sides and acting as if your mind is made up having never finished an introductory book on the subject. For comparison sake, I've been studying Israeli and Middle Eastern history pretty extensively for months now, and I've only begun forming any opinions, and I doubt I'd ever ""pick a side"", or even begin to assume I've nailed down what the problem is.

Finish that book, and read a few more, then start forming an opinion. In the meantime, I wouldn't mention the word Israel or Palestine to people you want to respect you. If you began spouting what you ""know"" about the topic to me in person, I'd die of laughter, and judge you as a complete ignoramus. I don't mean any offense, but you're about as far off base as possible and you need to know that.

I hope your interest in the subject continues; there are few more fascinating or important topics in my opinion.

0,Shout92,2,False,t3_2xnhwg,"**Our Winning Season**
A teen sports film that doesn't amount to much outside of a high school runner who learns to win thanks to his sister's deceased boyfriend. But I loved the characters and I loved spending time in their rural small town. I'm a sucker for these kind of films, coming of age stories with little on its mind except the foreboding that the world these kids know will be over before they realize it.

**Breaking Away**
I don't know when the last time was that I watched a film this likable. Coming of age stories are a dime-a-dozen and most of them are insufferable, especially those with quirkier aspirations. But BREAKING AWAY somehow manages to balance All-American living and teenage concerns with European-syle humor and aspirations, culminating in a film that is full of heart, truth, and more than a little Eye-talian zaniness, all ending on what is possibly a perfect freeze-frame of Paul Dooley's face.

It's crazy to think this was up against such heavy weights as APOCALYPSE NOW and ALL THAT JAZZ for Best Picture in 1979 (ultimately losing to KRAMER VS. KRAMER -- although it did win Best Original Screenplay). It just doesn't feel like the type of film that would typically compete for Oscars. Instead it's like a film your parents recorded on VHS that you rediscover years later. Today, this film would be content to be a Sundance favorite and nothing more than that.

**The Thing**
Antarctica, Winter 1982.

Not your usual setting for a horror film, but that’s part of what makes John Carpenter’s THE THING so great. Its science-fiction premise, centered around a shape-shifting alien that assumes the appearance of the people that it kills, is grounded in the harsh reality and isolation of the Antarctic. This isn’t about a bunch of teenagers at summer camp or ghost hunters exploring a haunted house. These are hard working men stuck out in the middle of the freezing cold, just trying to do a job when they find themselves faced with an otherworldly threat. In the tradition of Howard Hawks, each of the characters is a professional. Sure they make mistakes, but not out of a lack of trying.

The Thing is one of the great science-fiction horror films, second only to Ridley Scott’s ALIEN. It’s one of those rare films I’ve seen multiple times and yet am somehow still able to forget its many twists and turns. But the enduring legacy of this film is not its creature violence or effects, but rather, but in Carpenter’s ability to craft a compelling story of male survival… which just happens to feature a giant shape-shifting alien.

**Runaway Train**
Initially conceived by acclaimed Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, RUNAWAY TRAIN had the potential to be a great action film, one that could combine thrilling suspense and deep characterization with ease. But something happened on its way to the big screen, going through a trio of American screenwriters before finally being shot by a Russian filmmaker. I'm not sure if something important was lost in translation, but the final product is somehow as simplified and blunt as the film's title and confused over its aspirations.

Between Jon Voight and Eric Robert's over-the-top performances (both of which inexplicably received Oscar nominations), the bare-bones characterization of its supporting cast, on-the-nose and unintentionally hilarious dialogue, and the general lack of momentum (surprising for a film about an out-of-control train), I can't tell if this film is entertainingly bad or just straight-up bad, as it doesn't even bother to resolve itself, instead inexplicably ending with a Shakespeare quote. Kurosawa might've been able to pull that off, but in lesser hands, it comes off a bit too high minded.

**2 Fast 2 Furious**
Who knew how integral Vin Diesel was to the first FAST &amp; FURIOUS' success? Without his presence, this film feels like it's missing its heart and soul. Because of that, 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS (still the mother of all ""so-bad-it's-good"" titles, but just the beginning of the series descent into grammatically butchered titles) just feels like overproduced gloss, a poor imitation of something that worked before.

It has some brief moments of directorial flourish, but the script and cast just aren't up to par this time around (although Tyrese Gibson is an entertaining addition). Had it been a standalone, and not a sequel to a pretty entertaining film, I might've liked it more. Regardless, this is pretty much just poor-man's MIAMI VICE meets THE DUKES OF HAZZARD.",,cp23git,False,0,False,1427540439,t3_2xnhwg,2,flicks,,t1_cp23git,1425324398,t5_2uiee,,0

It bought out competitors and pushed its way into a lot of markets while others folded. Comcast is not inheritanly bad. Why people choose to take sides over this I will never understand. Comcast filled a market demand that companies like ATT would not in the 90s. Comcast reached out to smaller markets and worked with local and state governments to run line when others would not in the 90s. Comcast did all the things necessary to bring Internet to this country and is now being demonized for being an ISP. Comcast DROVE innovation in the USA during the 90s. While all of Europe was stewing in BS and having their governments flip the bill in much smaller countries with much smaller budgets (while the US subsidized their national security) Comcast was doing the work of building out infrastructure. I just don't understand the hate towards Comcast after all this time. Yes, the customer service sucks now. Yea, they at times bully smaller companies.

That video helped me understand better. In Greece it's more about politicians trying their best to get elected, so what do they do? Promise social benefits for the country. So already, they have debt in that regard. However, Greece as a country had a specific credit rating, which stopped them from borrowing what they couldn't eventually repay. Now that Greece has Germany's credit rating (Germany is EXTREMELY meticulous on repaying debt), they borrow much more than they usually borrow, leading into a debt crisis. This crisis is unique because the countries with better credit ratings are helping bail out countries like Greece, which continually overspend. This impacts the rest of Europe. So in the end, living anywhere in the EU wont help you escape the problems your country (Greece) created. There needs to be a culture change in Greece and fast. Politicians and the citizens can't rely on the government benefits. 

Here in Canada we get so many Greek people who settle here. They used to work for the government, so they retire and get FAT FAT pensions.

No.

&gt; I'm not saying that to be a dick, but I mean common dude, you just have to open up a newspaper and see all the shit going on in the world.

Seriously?  Just like the weapons of mass destruction that the papers swore were in Iraq, and we went to war over?  We are causing a lot of that shit, based on lies.

&gt; From ISIS, to Boko Haram, to Al Qaeda, to Al Shabab, Hamas, Hezbollah, Muslim Brotherhood... these organizations should be taken lightly? Or ignored, because the reality is, the world is safe?

No.  We confront them, as I and many of my friends have done.
 
&gt; Average people might be nice and kind. However the world is ruled by demigods who strive for absolute power and control, and will do it any cost.

Yep.
&gt; Putin, Assad, Maduro, Kim Jung Un... these guys are destroying nations, and making the geopolitical landscape increasingly more fragile. And those average nice people are getting killed by the thousands, simply for having opposing views. Just look at the Human Rights violations going on.

People *are* getting killed, among them personal friends.  I don't have to read about this from the newspaper.  I have traveled to some of these places while it was going on.
 
&gt; Still not convinced that the world is fucked. Well here are some other things to consider:
 
&gt; Yemens government getting overthrown, Argentina's government killing opposition, Ukraine and the shit going on there.
 
&gt; Look at places like Iran that continue to be ruled by an Ayatollah, or places like Pakistan which have nukes and are in a very volatile relationship with the U.S., especially after the Osama thing.

I have been to Iran under the Ayatollah.  Have you?   

&gt; Then you have places that suppress woman's rights like the Whabbist Saudi's. You have modern day slavery in places like Qatar &amp; UAE.

And you have champions of women's rights, such as the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Shirin Ebadi, and Anwar Sadat's widow, Jehan Sedat, both of whom I know.

Agreed.  These are all places that I have seen with my own eyes.

&gt; You have thwarted uprisings in places like Bahrain. Domestic terrorism in Libya. Egypt being run by a military coup.

Yep.  I have discussed this personally in Bahrain with members of the royal family, including Sheik Khalifa al Kaliefa (since passed).
 
&gt; You have South Africa going through racial tensions, and white oppression.

Yep.  I have met Denis Goldberg, who was imprisoned with Nelson Mandela.  I am not claiming that the struggle for justice is without cost.

&gt; You have a European Economy that is suffering immensely. Unemployment rates and lack of growth hurting countries like France.
 
&gt; You have domestic terrorism like the Charlie Hedbo attacks. You have Londoners marching in the streets calling for Sharia Law. You have Germans in the streets marching for ethnic cleansing.

&gt; You have Greece refusing to deal with the ramifications of an economic system that is unsustainable.

&gt; Literally every place in this world is dealing with some kind of shit, and the outlook is grim.

So you think this is new, and it is the only side?  You have a completely distorted view because you are looking at sources that portray only one side, and in the worst possible light.

&gt;

&gt;__Poppers__ is a [slang term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang) given to the [chemical class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_class) called [alkyl nitrites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkyl_nitrites) that are [inhaled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalant) for recreational purposes, especially in preparation for sex.  Today, poppers are mainly sold in cap vials.

&gt;Most widely sold concentrated products include the original compound [amyl nitrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyl_nitrite) (isoamyl nitrite, isopentyl nitrite), [cyclohexyl nitrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclohexyl_nitrite), [isobutyl nitrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isobutyl_nitrite) (2-methylpropyl nitrite), and [isopropyl nitrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopropyl_nitrite) (2-propyl nitrite). Isopropyl nitrite became popular due to a ban on isobutyl nitrite in the [EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU) in 2007. More rarely sold is the compound [butyl nitrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butyl_nitrite).

&gt;They were part of the club culture from the 1970s [disco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco) scene to the 1980s, and the 1990s [rave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rave) scene made their use popular.

1) Politics. Money goes to serve those in power, not necessarily where it is needed.

2) Hidden infrastructure. No one sees the water treatment facility / pipeline / bridge / road until it is damaged. Therefore, no one cares. 

3) Voter apathy. Many of the projects require bond funding. This is most frequently put before the voters. Small turnouts allow a small population to be disproportionally represented. Old people do not like to vote for bond proposals will long lead return items, such as maintenance. 

4) Other priorities. Voters do not elect officials on infrastructure. They vote on education, immigration and other hot topics. 

5) If it ain't broke, don't fix it. There is a mindset of run till it fails, comparing infrastructure to a car. Replace a part now and then but once it gets too much, just get a new car

6) Social Stigma. This is particular to mass transit. Outside of a few major metro areas, mass transit is seen as for the poor people. 

7) Difficulty in observation. The average person can grasp progress on a new road or bridge project. Not many can follow new undercoating of a bridge deck or replacement of cast valve bodies with forgings.  

8) Population Density. The US is spread out. Difficulty in balance between serving the entire populace is not easy. Not many European or Asian countries have this issue.

I don't agree that it has, no.

The SNP could have called their referendum any time, any day - the Scottish Parliament can call a consultative referendum on any issue that it chooses; the SNP could call a consultative referendum on independence tomorrow if they wanted to.

The issue is that it would have no legal weight whatsoever and they know it, otherwise they would not have negotiated the Edinburgh Agreement to legitimise it and ensure that the British Government agreed to be bound by the result.

&gt; However I think if Brexit occurs, or the SNP wait until 2020 (assuming they are still in power), then the UK government would have no legs to stand on.

On the contrary, it was a ""once in a generation"" decision and the ""sovereign will of the Scottish people"" that they remain part of the United Kingdom, fully aware of the possibility that a referendum on leaving the European Union was on the cards.

&gt;..same with, take a look at the conflict with China, the maritime conflict, where is it taking place? Is it off the coast of California, is it in the Carribean? No. It's off the coast of China. That's where we have to protect what we call 'freedom of the seas' - in China's waters. This is part of the concept that we basically own the world, and we have the right to do anything we like, and nobody has a right to stand up to it. Now in the case of Ukraine..  

I couldn't find an exact match for the phrase 'China maritime conflict'. It is not a maritime conflict, it is a maritime (territorial) dispute. Using the word 'conflict', and saying that it is taking place 'off the coast of China, implies that this is a bi-national US-China conflict. It is actually a multinational dispute between no less than 6 countries in the region like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, etc., but naturally Chomsky doesn't say something like 'it's off the coast of China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, etc.' At the very least, it seems like Chomsky here is implying support for the idea and right of a Chinese invasion and takeover of Taiwan, something most of the world I guess hopes will never take place. 

He also ignores the question of whether China would allow safe and open sea lanes through the South China Sea if the US followed his advice and completely retrenched from any issues involving the South China Sea. He seems to be saying that this decision is the right of China and China alone whether or not to extend this right to its neighbors. In structural realist language, the US enjoys the 'freedom to roam' globally. I wonder how Europeans would feel if China enjoyed such freedom, roaming all over the Atlantic. 

Not to mention other obvious problems with using grand sweeping phrases like 'basically own the world'. Thats the language of hormonal teenagers, not a world famous serious academic; then again, maybe using such language is exactly why he's so famous. That's my point about this guy - I think that he achieved fame by giving up the position of serious people taking him seriously. If he's taken seriously in the field of linguistics (and I know that in many/most linguistics departments in Europe, 'Chomsky' is a dirty word), he isn't in the field of politics. 

Chomsky just ignores huge concepts, such as western values (i.e. human rights) or global public goods. This is why he has never written an academic paper in the field of politics - he couldn't get published, because he'd have to go through the peer review process, and his arguments are so full of gaping holes that whatever he would write would most likely get rejected every time. 

Chomsky is basically an (neo?) anarchist. Its clear what he stands against, but I can't help wondering what exactly it is that he stands *for*.

I also think, though, that there is an innate, deeper cause to ""white guilt"".  One of the more compelling theories I've heard is that it has to do with the environment Europeans evolved in.  Our history of living in northern, harsh climates affected by ice ages and such made working together in larger groups necessary for our very survival.  There was an evolutionary selection for open-mindedness, acceptance, and the ability to compromise.  The theory goes that Europeans don't limit their loyalties just to their immediate kin as many other groups to, and have more loyalty to a larger tribe or nation, and are thus inclined to give people different from themselves more of the benefit of the doubt.

I consider their policies racist. Especially considering they have to forcefully migrate a native population of Arabs to gain it. But the reverse would be true in that I don't agree with Arab nationalist policies either insomuch as they may exclude Jews or other nationalities.

&gt; I'd totally support Israel and the Jews in their quest to form a homeland for their people but they work tirelessly to subvert and subjugate white countries for their own benefit.

This, of course, is not based on reality.

&gt; I don't have a problem with non-whites. I just don't want them in my country.

Here's the trouble. You are American. So, when you speak of who's country it is you are basing it some national or racial idea of a homeland. But since you are White your racial homeland isn't in the Americas, at all. It is somewhere in Europe. As a matter of fact, your exclusion of ""illegal"" Hispanics is completely misplaced. Racially, they are of Native American stock. In other words, this is their homeland more than it is yours. They've been here for tens of thousands of years. 1630 is a paltry date under which to claim some ownership of this land.

And what of Blacks? They were kidnapped by Whites (and Black Africans, no doubt) and brought to this nation against their will. Since it was the racist slave trade that brought them here it seems illogical to send them back to some homeland they've never known through racist policy. And if that is the case that they should be migrated back to Africa then it can only be reasonable that you and your kin should emigrate back to Europe. Europe is your ancestral homeland.

If you think America is your place then you admit that racial homelands are completely arbitrary therefore your own argument collapses upon itself.

&gt; Whites are a minority in the world and we can't afford to be fucking around with the survival of our people.

But you are hardly endangered. Whites have a disproportionate stake in the world economy.

&gt; I fully expect you to hold the survival of you and your people as the highest moral good and I don't think bad of you for it. Why do you think low of me for thinking the same?

If that's the case then I have no problem with you. But I'm definitely going to have to advocate policies that will cause you and yours to be removed to Europe, from whence you came.

&gt;Not single link out of the first top ten options have the word microsoft anywhere on their page, which I confirmed by using the word search tool in Firefox. It's a beautiful graph, but unfortunately for all I know, some uneducated child in Africa messing around in a paint app could have accidentally just created all that fake data, because there is no credible source whatsoever.

The first rule of being a Microsoft militant astroturfer is to reject the truth and defend the company at all costs.

&gt;Yandex has absolutely nothing to do with MS. If a company failed in Russia because of American distrust, or Russian nationalism, as this source references then other American companies will fail as well. Therefore, as an MS supporter my take on this situation is inherently unbiased, because MS's results would be the same or worse if they tried to compete in Russia. Therefore, future success in Russia would stem from either lack of Russian nationalism/US dislike, or cheating. We know feature parity is not a competitive edge Google has over Yandex because the source cites multiple things Google is prized for that Yandex had earlier. And because Putin would likely severely fear a lack of nationalism, the logical answer must be that Google is being anti-competitive.

Microsoft is behind most attacks on Google just like they were behind most of the attacks on Linux. Did you know that Microsoft was also behind the antitrust investigations into Google in Europe? They were also the main player in the antitrust investigations into Google in the USA. Going so far as to create shill companies such as Fair Search to do their dirty PR work for them.  Microsoft is a very dirty company who will do anything to get the upperhand on Google.  Also, Microsoft wants to destabilize Google so they'll do whatever they can do achieve that regardless of whether it's directly beneficial to them. If the sole outcome is that it hurts Google then it's a partnership they want to pursue. If Yandex wants to be the default search engine then all they have to do is fork Android and make their search engine the default. If they don't have the technical skills to do so then perhaps they should acquire it. I hear Cyanogen mod is hoaring themselves out. Being technically incompetent is not a defense.

In 1995, the UK agreed to change the specification we're on from 240 V +6%/-6% to 230 V +10%/–6%. What this means is, is that in practice, the UK remains on 240 V and the European countries who use the 220 V system stay with 220 V. We still operate on 240 Volts.

By the tolerance being +10%/-6%, there's a range of 216.2-253.0 Volts, so we're not on 230 V at all.

240 V +6%/-6% has a toleration range of 225.6 to 254.4V.

~~Regarding the player payment stipulation that requires the player to be an active starter in order to receive per-game pay:~~

&gt; ~~Looking at these last two clauses holistically you can see that the player only gets the compensation for playing in the LCS when he is part of the starting roster or brought in as a substitute (§ 2 No. 4). If he gets demoted to 'reserve player' (§2 No. 3) he doesn’t receive anything at all. This becomes particularly problematic if this contact wants to be an employment agreement. I would argue that this is part of the wage since his work activity is to train, play in scrims as well as in competitions. It would again be against minimum wage laws if the player doesn’t get anything as a reserve player. As a 'reserve player,' he continues to work for MYM, is bound by their directives, and still has assigned his personal rights. Removing any compensation 'because of his performance or conduct or has not been designated for the competition because of his performance or conduct' cannot be justified.~~

~~The rule this comment about reads:~~

&gt; ~~... MYM shall pay an entry fee to the Player... on the following fixed rates... 555,55 euros (~62,370 USD) including eventual VAT (Value Added Tax) per match played... as [a starter].~~

~~This clause is an example of how hanging clauses with unclear objects can really muddy up a contract. The way I think this is supposed to read is that the contract player gets an entry fee (salary) of 55,555 euros for the year, and then gets VAT added for each game they play as a starter. I'm assuming the VAT referred to is to cover the tax that players will have to pay for the salary paid by Riot's LCS contract. In other words, the VAT is sort of like a bonus so that players can receive the LCS contract money and then have their tax on that money paid for by the MYM contract (through a process called grossing up). I'm not sure *why* you would have a VAT provision like this limited to the LCS salary, but I'm sure they have their reasons.~~

~~I think interpreting it as saying they get paid *anything* **only** when they're starters is grammatically sensible, but not realistic. I think in the context of the other sections, it's pretty clear that this is a general salary provision with added VAT per game for the players who earn money as LCS starters.~~

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**FEEL FREE TO IGNORE EVERYTHING ABOVE.** I'm not going to delete it because it serves to prove that one should read closely before commenting. :3 I read 555,55 and thought it was just a different way to write 55,555 when it's actually the EU way of writing decimals. We use periods, they use commas. My apologies. That is interesting then. Their entire means of living is based on the LCS base-salary plus what sounds like a per-occasion publicity right (though I'm sure/*hoping* the team covers their living accomodations). That is certainly problematic. Even if subs have their living covered by the team, they are surely owed more compensation than they seem to be receiving (which is near-nothing).

Then again something might be getting lost in translation. As Anna points out, when you translate an English contract to German (and vice versa) you tend to lose the power that certain terms of art carry. There's a famous chicken contract case where this very issue causes a conflict and no meeting of the minds takes place because the two parties meant two different things. [Found it: *Frigaliment Importing Co. v. B.N.S. Int'l Sales Corp.*, 190 F.Supp. 116 (S.D.N.Y. 1960).](http://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/contracts/contracts-keyed-to-knapp/the-meaning-of-the-agreement-principles-of-interpretation-and-the-parol-evidence-rule/frigaliment-importing-co-v-b-n-s-international-sales-corp-2/) The companies didn't know what each other meant by chicken, and one sent what the other didn't think he was ordering. Funny case.

I'll re-read closer and maybe dissect a few other things when I have the time. In any case, I enjoyed the brief read and thank you both for continuing to look into this ongoing issue. MYM's problems don't end with Kori and ""Move Your Mother"" jokes. It's a continuing issue with MYM and LCS teams in general having muddied contracts that clash with LCS terms or general employment/contract law.

Now we have in 1533 England Henry VIII, with Cranmer the Archbishop of Canterbury. In theology, the Church of England of 1533 is very similar to that of the Roman Catholic Church. Neither Cranmer nor Henry VIII pushed for any significant reform. Many bishops refused to accept Cranmer's authority. Henry and his allies then pushed for legislation that declares the royal head of state to be the  head of the Church of England, which passed as the Acts of Supremacy starting in late 1534. This was strengthened by the Treasons Act, which was used to persecute Catholics such as Thomas More. This allowed them to dissolve monasteries and confiscate their property. 

Skipping ahead, Henry VIII did get what he wanted: a divorce (which turned out to be several), but not yet a male heir, and the succession of that male heir to the throne. Through this era were developments of the idea of Protentantism in continental Europe, with major events such as Martin Luther's rise, the formation of the Schmalkaldic league in Germany, iconoclasm in Germany and the low Countries, the Confession of Augsburg, and many others. As Henry VIII had briefly married his fourth wife Anne of Cleves, he had to pay attention to the politics of Germany at the time of the Schmalkaldic league. This exposed Henry VIII to the theology developed by Luther and Melanchthon. 

When Edward VI succeeded Henry VIII, many changes were pushed forward by the reformers, one of the tools of propagation being the Book of Common Prayer. Compulsory clerical celibacy among others, while maintained under Henry VIII, was finally overturned along with many doctrines. The new doctrines were then codified in a reform programme. 

Unfortunately for Cranmer, and possibly for the Church of England, Edward VI was succeeded by Mary I who was a strict doctrinal Roman Catholic. Reformers of the Church of England were tried and condemned to death. 

It is informative to look at the rest of Europe at this time. Mary I was the only child of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, and she was born in 1516. Edward VI, her younger half brother, was born in 1537. In 1553, he died 16-year young, whereas she ascended as a 37-year old woman. Clearly, finding a husband and producing an heir was a very important concern, but she had to first find a suitable partner. Her cousin Charles V suggested that she marry his 26-year old son Philip II, who at the time was a widower but had one son from the first marriage. After negotiations, the marriage was celebrated in summer of 1554. Both Philip and Mary were staunchly conservative Catholics. 

At this time, Charles V had started to abdicate his various titles, either to Philip II his son or to his brother Ferdinand, who became Holy Roman Emperor. In the years prior, he had made himself busy designing *how* his vast empire would be administered. He strongly wanted Philip to be King of Spain, and he offered Philip to consider which of the other possessions he things he wanted to rule (an exception being Austria and many HRE lands who were already quite firmly in Ferdinand's control). The Low Countries was very important to Charles: he was born there and he grew up there. Philip decided that he wanted to rule the Low Countries. This meant he also needed control of either the sea lanes between Spain and the Low Countries, or the land routes from Italy to the Low Countries, preferably both. 

**The orbit of Spain - England - Low Countries was a very important factor for Mary I, Charles V, and Philip II.**

We know now that after Mary I's false pregnancy, she did not produce an heir and the throne went to Elizabeth, a Protestant. But Elizabeth's England and Philip's Spain did not immediately became enemies. And in fact, some in England suggested that Elizabeth marry Philip. For the first ten years relationships were cordial, even if they were moving in opposite directions. 

The successes of the Duke of Alba in fighting against the Dutch rebellion forced Elizabeth to increase her support of the rebels. The presence of a large Spanish force just across the narrow ocean worried English reformers, whose memory of Mary's persecution was fresh. The relationship between England and Spain was significantly hurt when England seized Spanish ships carrying bullion that were meant to pay for Alba's troops. 

Even if relations were very sour for the next few years, neither side escalated the tension. Elizabeth's primary threat at that time was Mary Queen of Scots, who was Catholic, and was strongly aligned with the Valois of France. So Elizabeth wanted a cordial relationship with Spain as a counter-weight against France.

0,Willravel,-2,False,t3_2xnsc8,"He did a great job as Heimdall in the Thor movies. Heimdall is a germanic mythological figure, as in someone who was thought up by people of Northern European ancestry. His being black didn't diminish the role for anyone, though, despite the figure having been white for thousands of years. Only a few racists freaked out about it, and I think they shut up the moment he killed a giant spaceship by stabbing it to death. 

I don't know that we should omit people from roles because of their race. The first thing we should be asking is ""How well suited is this actor or actress for the role?"" not ""Is this person the correct race?"" 

As a long-time Bond fan, it's also worth noting that all of the actors who have portrayed the character on screen have diverged in appearance from the literary character in significant ways. Bond is supposed to look very lean, almost lanky, and tall, with blue-grey eyes, and a face similar to jazz musician Hoagy Carmichael. He has jet black hair, gaunt cheeks, a large scar on his cheek and, depending on where you are in the timeline, a large scar on his hand. We've had guys of medium and tall stature, leaner and beefier, blond and brunette, brown eyed and blue eyed. None of that really affected the character, which far more came from the writing and the acting. Roger Moore is lighter-haired with light eyes like Craig, but their takes on Bond are completely different. Still, they were both well suited for the versions of Bond they played, with Moore being a bit more tongue in cheek and Craig being more serious. 

I'm not saying Elba should play James Bond necessarily (Craig's just killing it, I'm happy to see him in more Bond movies for the foreseeable future), I just think it's weird people are so caught up on being white as a part of Bond's character in a story taking place in 2015. It made sense when the stories were taking place in the 1950s, when there wouldn't have been black spies because of institutionalized racism, but nobody who matters cares about the appropriate race of an assassin spy now.

I was a huge fan of their playstyle. Only fight when you want to fight, safe games and late game mastery. All that good stuff. Even when that playstyle didn't work anymore, and they had some crazy games against Gambit to not get relegated, I was a huge fan.

I was the happiest when Froggen built his own team. It was like a fairytale, rebuild the team so it can perform in the current meta. Starting from a Jungle-Mid synergy, picking up good players from different sources. Eventually taking first place after some struggles and going to worlds as Europe's first seed.

But then it became a lot harder to support them. While multiple sources reported good news about TSM and C9, them playing against Korean teams and improving massively. Actually learning from scrimming the best teams, Tabzz was a guy with Vlogs about the culture, the food and complaints about his jetlag. You could hear he was barely getting the soloqueue time and nobody was really telling him how he should combat the jetlag. I think it's the role of the management to step in. It's not a vacation, there shouldn't be so much time to enjoy. It's work in the first place. The Kabum game spoke for itself. All the synergy, the team comp, the basic knowledge of some champions, it all seemed to be gone. In a game that always had to be a win. I'm still blaming Tabzz and the management of the team for the whole worlds situation. I was excited when they switched Tabzz with Rekkles. A more professional player, the best Adc in Europe, a team player,... I thought this would only be an improvement and it should've been.

With the rebranding to Elements, the pathetic interview and the questionable roster swaps of both Wickd and Nyph, it's hard to support them. I like Krepo, both as a player and as a person. But I think the management threw away all the synergy Rekkles and Nyph built up. I understand Kev1n, but their reasoning for it (in the interview) is just so messy. They are contradicting themselves in one and the same interview, it's pathetic. They want to streamline the team, have less opinions. But at the same time, they say Kev1n is a vocal leader. So they did not remove an opinion, they just swapped Wickd's for Kev1n's.

It's cringeworthy to see how they play this season. Always late to react, never making the plays themselves. Not knowing what to do. Some games, it feels like they are bleeding to death. And even the games where they are in control, they start to throw. Completely against their own style and principles. They also seemed lifeless, drained of their spirit.

Right now, I'm happy they have Krepo because of his personality, insight and positivity. Someone who isn't afraid to make plays, call shots or discuss strategy. I'm happy Froggen kept showing his skill, even in the bad times. However, I can no longer say I'm a real fan of Elements. I don't get sad when they lose, I feel no adrenaline rush when they win crucial fights. The connection team-fan is lost. And I mostly blame the management. Assigning a Dota coach, giving that bad of an interview, making these kind of swaps.

I would like to have most of my expenses covered, i.e. &gt;50% of costs. Flights would be economy, and hotels would be standard, but I'm also open to staying in hostels, or other creative situations. I know several people in Germany, England, and France, who might be open to hosting me for a couple days; however, that is not certain at this point in time, as they may or may not be out of the area(s), busy otherwise, etc.

I also would like to travel domestically (for work, shorter vacations, etc.), though there are no clear goals there; a trip to Louisiana or the NY area for a week, maybe once a year, but these are second to the larger trip I would like to plan.

This is mostly true, but it does not address why European colonization was such an important factor in bringing about the 1994 genocide.  This idea that because differences predated colonization, colonial powers could not be blamed for exacerbating tensions is inherently wrong.

First, there is archaeological evidence to suggest that there were three separate groups that migrated to present-day Rwanda.  But there is an implication that these separate groups started ethnically homogeneous kingdoms.  This implication is false.  Races did not really exist in pre-colonial Rwanda.  Also, clans are not limited to Hutu or Tutsi.  Intermarriage has been common since the cohabitation of Hutu and Tutsi (2 plus millennial).  In these cases, ethnic identity is determined patrilineally.  Lineage lines are determined by tracing the male line of decedents.  In this case, that makes lineages confined to either Hutu or Tutsi.  However, all major clans in Rwanda have both Hutu and Tutsi in them.  Clan lines are traced to a common ancestor, and they have  nothing to do with being Hutu or Tutsi.  The truth is that if ""racially pure"" Hutu or Tutsi groups ever did exist, they have long since lost any purity through thousands of years of intermarriage.

The terms ""Hutu"" and ""Tutsi"", have been in constant flux since their birth. For the vast majority of pre-colonial history, ""Hutu"" was a term used for the masses, while ""Tutsi"" was used to denote who held power.  One could move between those two identities, not easily, but in a way that kept the classes fluid.   The reason that Tutsi have often been thought of as a group of herders is that they were. This is not because there was some biological tick in them that made them love herding.  It is not necessarily that Tutsi were herders, but that herders were Tutsi.  The reason being, in Rwanda there is a spiritual connection to cows, milk, and meat.  This meant that if one had cattle, their societal status was raised, thus making them Tutsi, generally speaking.

Under the reign of Mwami Rwabugiri (1853-1895), ethnic identities did tighten.  No longer could one move between the two classes. Corvee labor was imposed on the Hutu who, by nature, were out of power.

  A biologic difference between Hutu and Tutsi did at one time exist, but two millennia of cohabitation and intermarriage has made biologic differences disappear, or at the very least irrelevant.  And while Rwabugiri did tighten the definitions of ""Hutu"" and ""Tutsi"", colonial rulers did much more to solidify the ""races""

Just tell them ""look guys you are at least signatory and do not even have Atomic Weapons , fix this this and that - if we are no sanctioning guys doing nothing while having Atomic Weapons , why would we punish you"" 

Well, signing an agreement isn't mandatory. But Iran did sign so now its bound by it. I cant sign a contract where I oblige to do something and then point at another who has not signed any contract as an excuse for me to not hold up my end of the deal.


&gt; Sooooo the logical conclusion is .... put some sanctions on Israel too , they will give up their nuclear Weapon too ... and we will make volatile region at least safer in that regard, if nothing more 

Once again, Israel, India and Pakistan are not bound by the NPT, stop playing dumb. And I would love for NK, Israel, Pakistan, India, US, UK, France, China and Russia to disarm. But it wont happen soon.


&gt; Nothing about sanctioning countries that you do not like , while not sanctioning countries that you do like (or need) , for same things - is logical and non hypocritical
Well maybe it is logical - that is how you subjugate foreign countries that are not in line with your policies and politics
but it is openly and in your face hypocritical

Once again, neither India, Israel or Pakistan has broken any treaty, validating a sanction. Sweden didn't even have any sanction on Iran until they broke the treaty according to IAEA who then moved the question to the UNSC, which Sweden abides. It *is* perfecly logical, and not really hypocritical. Once again; *pacta sunt servanda*.


&gt; If you were not sanctioning other countries far away from ""backyard"" it would not be.

You start to sound butthurt. The fact that I, and most of Europe consider the recent invasion of a nearby country by one of our neighbours more troublesome than a 70 year old conflict with two distinct aggressors on both sides can be hypocritical in your eyes then. I don't really care though. I can also not be arsed about Kashmir, West Sahara, etc. etc. etc.... So, what ever?


&gt; that West and sanctions have nothing to do with right , morality , human rights , international laws , justice ... etc , and that is all pure politics and interest
I thought I was clear from beginning 

Well, neither has anyone else. *Especially* any of the corrupt pan-arab regimes in the Middle East. But if you sign a treaty and refuse to abide it, it is going to have consequence, morality or not.


&gt; well at least you in Sweden have democracy figured out - right ? Vote for it - if you loose , shut up and give them your money - that is how democracy works - right ?

Pretty much, yep. There have been quite a bit of a stir recently when SIDA (Sweden's governmental AID organ) couldn't account for a lot of money, so hopefully something will change in a while.


&gt; yeah but I argued that it is not anymore help but investment - I have nothing against investment but we are talking about which countries should be helped (and how - meaning most efficiently) not invested in

I edited my answer above:
*Investment means we should be getting something out of it more than good will. I am not talking about investments.

0,neverwilliusethis,2,False,t3_2xna84,"Enter European Colonialism:

Rwanda was first colonized by Germans immediately prior to the turn of the twentieth century and later succeeded by Belgium after Germany was forced to cede its colonies following the First World War.  Both pursued a “divide and conquer strategy” of pitting the two “races”, Hutu and Tutsi, against one another.  Belgium was distinctly effective at pushing the “separate races” initiative.  The Hamitic Hypothesis (more on this below) became the basis for class division and establishing a group of indigenous Rwandans that could serve the greater interests of Belgian colonialism.  This took hold in the education system that was primarily run by Catholic Missionaries.
	The Catholic Church officially supported the Hamitic Hypothesis and the interests of the Belgian colonizers.  They submitted race reports to the Belgian colonial authorities that noted the difference in civility between the Hutu and the Tutsi.  The latter were seen as “supreme humans” in contrast to the uncouth and boorish Hutu.  Primary education was offered to both Hutu and Tutsi, but Tutsi were taught in French and Hutu taught in Kiswahili.  Secondary education was only offered to Tutsi.  Catholic missionaries instilled a sense of inferiority in Hutu populations by professing the belief that nomadic Tutsis had invaded Rwanda; asserted their dominance by killing Hutu chiefs; and enslaved the Hutu population.
	The results of this indoctrination of the Hamitic Hypothesis in Rwandan schools can be seen even in contemporary Rwanda.  A series of Rwandan generations grew up with the idea that there was a biological difference between themselves and their neighbors.  This biological difference made one group more suitable for holding political power and the other doomed to menial and, sometimes, forced labor.  Catholic education was wrought with “discriminatory practices [and] racial myths” that supported structural racism.  This was the point in Rwandan ethnic identity construction that the Hamitic Hypothesis became a fact for the Rwandan people.  It came to define who they were and what they were destined to do.
	In addition to the ethnic rift created by colonial education, the Belgian colonizers pursued a policy to “racialize the local authority”.  This was a ploy to make local officials directly and solely responsible to their colonial overlords.  This included de-emphasis of the monarch and a wholesale replacement of all Hutu local officials with Tutsis.  This shift in power facilitated the resurrection of corvée labor.  Tutsi chiefs were directed to submit their Hutu constituency to forced labor aimed at building or supporting colonial infrastructure and producing cash crops, specifically coffee.  By stripping the Hutus of any semblance of power and creating an indoctrinated group of subservient indigenous colonizers, the Belgians had created an elite to rule over exploited laborers.
The 1933 census was conducted by the Belgians and divided the Rwandan population into four categories: white, Tutsi, Hutu, and Twa.  This census, once and for all, defined who was Tutsi and who was Hutu.  It factored in traditional associations of Tutsi ownership of cows, church information, and physical measurements to divide the indigenous population into roughly 85% Hutu and 15% Tutsi.  All indigenous people were given identity cards.  Future ethnicity was to be determined patrilineally, thus solidifying ethnic identity through biological determinants.
During colonialism, what it meant to be Tutsi or Hutu changed.  Eugenics and the Hamitic Hypothesis were evident in colonial manipulation of the Rwandan people.  The fluidity of precolonial ethnicity allowed “Tutsi” to be synonymous with power.  Colonialism shifted this dialogue from Tutsi are power to Tutsi have power.  This change is subtle but significant.  One reason why ethnic violence was non-existent prior to 1959 was that for most of precolonial Rwandan history, ethnic classes were permeable.  Thus, one could obtain power no matter what class he or she was born into.  Colonialism’s biologic interpretation of class disallowed identity redefinitions.  Once born into an ethnicity, one could not escape the title.  This biological interpretation of ethnicity allowed animosities to ferment.  The majority of the population was subject to forced labor until 1949, and even after its abolition Hutu farmers experienced significantly more oppressive taxation than their Tutsi counterparts.  Eight-five percent of the population was being oppressed by fellow Rwandans.  Soon Hutus came to see Tutsis, not as their neighbors, but, as a foreign people that invaded Rwanda.  Tutsis were seen in the same light as the Belgian colonizers.  Hutu discontent with Tutsi and a public education system designed to create a racial cleavage, made Rwanda ripe redistribution of power upon Belgian withdrawal.

So, sorry to be that dick who cares too much, but I felt like half the story was being told.
Below is a synopsis of the Hamitic Hypothesis:
The Hamitic Hypothesis is one of the most dynamic, elaborate, malleable, and laughable explanations that academic eugenicists produced.  A brief history behind the Hamitic Hypothesis is necessary to understand how it came to be applied to colonial Rwanda.  In one Biblical story, Noah (same Noah who built the arc) became very drunk one day, and as his children tried to clothe him one did not avert his eyes.  This son was Ham. When Noah learned Ham had seen him unclothed, Noah cursed Ham’s son, Canaan.
	There is another passage in the Bible that describes the people of Africa as Kushites.  It was popularly believed, in Europe, that the Kushites were black, even though this is not mentioned anywhere in the bible, and that they were the descendants of Ham’s other son, Kush.  The myth was then manipulated further to proclaim that all of Ham’s sons were cursed by Noah.  This skewed interpretation of the Biblical myth provided the justification for the enslavement of Africans on the basis that they were cursed by divine ordainment.
	During the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt, Europeans were exposed to an African culture that appeared to have all the trappings of an advanced civilization.  This did not sit well with eugenicists who argued that a hierarchy of races established that Caucasoid people were more advanced than Africans.  The Hamitic Hypothesis was again used to quell European consciences.  This new interpretation declared that the Egyptians who possessed the intellect and capability to make such wonders as the pyramids at Giza, were the descendants of Ham’s son Mizriam.  This time the myth took a more accurate interpretation of the Bible by recognizing that only Canaan was cursed by Noah.  The blood line and phenotype of the presumed Caucasoid Mizriamites then became diluted through centuries of intermarriage with native peoples.  This dilution of the “pure” Mizriamites with indigenous blood was postulated by John Hanning Speke and propagated by Charles Gabriel Seligman.
	When the German colonizers first arrived in Rwanda they found that Tutsi held the highest positions of state and that Hutu must be subservient.  They then inferred that there must be a biological difference between the Hutu and the Tutsi.  European intellectuals had become well acquainted with the work of Joseph Deniker, who attempted to map European racial boundaries.  He also described the phenotype of the “Kushite-Hamites” as “tall, aquiline nose, nomadic populations” that could be traced back to Ethiopia.  Tutsi were thought to be Hamitic.  They had invades from the north and possessed stronger martial skills and were more civilized than the indigenous Bantu people.  Years of intermarriage had changed the color of their skin to black, but not as black as their Hutu neighbors.
	To ensure that the white colonizers would remain in power, the traditional Rwandan myth of the Bimanuka was redefined to make it appear as if the divide between Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa had historical precedence and was divinely ordained.  This new myth followed a Rwandan Mwami (King) who wanted to see which one of his sons was fit to rule.  He decided that his son Gatutsi was the most noble and that he would rule over the “gluton serf Gawa” and the “clumsy peasant Gahutu”.  This new interpretation of the myth established Tutsi as the economic, political, and social rulers of all the “races” of Rwanda.  Yet again we can see that the definition and the characteristics of Rwandan social categories were not innate, but a manipulation of traditional Rwandan and Biblical myths and quasi-science so that the elite could impose an identity upon Rwandans.  Mamdani suggests that a political identity can be defined as a group whose social category is recognized and fostered by the state.  Social categorization of Hutu and Tutsi during the colonial period can best be described as political identities that colonial powers imposed upon the masses.  The terms used to define one’s group was the same, but the characteristics that defined each group had changed drastically.  One’s status as a member of either group was a result of one’s phenotype, the Hamitic Hypothesis, and an identity card that was issued by state authorities.  This myth has come to be the single most important identifier of social category in Rwanda over the last century.  One can observe this in the actions of génocidaires who, in 1994, threw the bodies of murdered Tutsi into the Nayabarongo River, which is a tributary of Lake Victoria.  Lake Victoria is the source of the Nile.  So, by discarding the bodies of the Tutsi into the Nayabarongo, the génocidaires were returning the Tutsi to their northerly origin.",,cp2bk1h,False,0,False,1427544229,t1_cp2b7ae,2,history,,t1_cp2bk1h,1425337246,t5_2qh53,,0

Economic historians often view countries as having a relatively stable growth rate over the long term. The world wars (or at least world war 2) tended to damage this growth, but this was followed by particularly rapid growth afterwards, until the economy caught up with it's long-term trend. Thus we see France and Germany (and Japan) having long booms after WW2. The UK is the exception that proves the rule in this case, as its economy expanded during the war, and it grew relatively more slowly afterwards.

A further (and perhaps slightly contradictory) reason is that both wars encouraged a shakeup and modernisation of institutions. Germany came out of post-war reconstruction with a much more modern economic and political system. In the ECSC/EC Germany, France, and other countries were able to create a large and effective economic block that encouraged trade and growth.

All I know has come from co-workers at various jobs, mostly Indian and Chinese, and one guy from the UK. [This article](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/22/the_finest_weird_people_in_the_world_live_here_and_were_proud_of_it/) from last week touches on the basics, and also has some observations on life in the US, from a UK software developer.

Yes, I'm pretty sure you need the offer/sponsorship from a US company before you start the visa process.  One of the questions on the US visa form is basically ""how do you expect to support yourself while here"".

(If you don't already have a plain old passport, get one.  You should be able to do that right now without a job offer or anything.  I know that some huge percentage of people in western Europe already have one, but it's not as common in the US.)

Every once in a while you will run across a job ad that says that sponsorship is not available; either the company is being cheap, or (in rare cases) it's something like defense where they are legally required to only hire US citizens.  If the job ad doesn't say, and you get a response, you should probably mention fairly early on that you will need a visa to work in the US.  A lot of bigger companies won't care and are used to this process, but they need to know early on to get it started.

As I understand it, you get a (temporary) work permit at first, tied to your job at a particular company.  This runs for at least a couple of years.  This lets you work legally, but if you quit or get fired or the company goes away, you have 30 days to *leave the US* - no joke.  This permit can be renewed at least a couple of times.

The golden ticket is a ""green card"" - becoming a naturalized US citizen.  I don't think you can apply for that until you've lived here for a while, though.  Once you have that, you can do 99.999% of the things that a native-born citizen can.  (Becoming President is one exception.)

Some of my co-workers have been frustrated that the company kept renewing their work permit, rather than starting the green card process.  Renewing the work permit was legal, but it still kept them tied to that company; if they had a green card they could go to work anywhere.

Also, a lot of my co-workers found it helpful to get an (en-US) attorney/lawyer; (en-GB) solicitor once they got here - one that specifically deals with immigration law - to help with the paperwork and legal filings.  Your company in the US may refer you to one, or if there are other foreigners working there, they may be able to tell you of a good one.

While you're still at university, poke around their advising / career services department.  You probably aren't the first student that's done this and they may be able to refer you to some local (UK) help.

I hope this helps!

Now Korea most likely has the best team in the world, GE Tigers, however we will never know because Riot sucks at organising international competition. We will see GE Tigers at IEM Season IX World Championship, then we have to wait a few more months before the invitational thing that happens between the 2 domestic league seasons for EU, China, NA and Korea and then finally again at the World Championship (3 international events in a year on average, two pretty much within a month or two of each other, the final one at the latter quarter of the year)

Now, as a Korean your main revenue source is going to be actually winning/salary as Twitch viewers don't use Azubu and the numbers just aren't high on the Korean streamers for this to be viable for earning money. This is why a lot of Koreans jumped ship, they jump ship to a weaker region and in this weaker region they are paid much large amounts of money (500,000 CNY - 1,000,000 CNY) compared to Korea, they have a better chance at plays offs and possibly a spot at world championships.

But here is the funny thing, so many Koreans jumped ship and not just T2-3 players, T1 players like Flame, Dade, Imp, Deft, Mata all jumped; this is the equivalent of Ferrari_430, Mushi, Burning, iceiceice all jumping to NA. Due to such a large amount leaving, it created this weird power vacuum in Korea, and now the difference in skill between T1 and T2 Korean teams is the largest it has ever been. With all these players and teams leaving (Samsung White and Blue, two of the best teams in the world, gone 1 week after World Championships which White won), Korea actually would be a better choice if you want to make playoffs/World Championship, especially considering T2 KR teams could use some of the Korean players that jumped ship.

If Kespa actually paid these players more, they would stay...I don't think many of the Koreans are enjoying China as Flame said on social media that his worst move was going to China or that he would never go back or something like that (He was playing on LGD along with Acorn, some would say these were the best top laners in Korea, maybe the world). There will most likely be a large Korean exodus from China next season, maybe a few will stay, especially ones that win/go to world championship, that is if they get paid which is 50-50 in China for players it seems.

As for Tesla's costing more in Europe: In Norway for example, an equivalent gas car to the Tesla would cost $300,000 US dollars due to taxes. As a pure EV, the Tesla doesn't have any of these taxes at all so it costs only $80,000. This is one reason why it is one of the highest selling cars in Norway at the moment. I don't know if the i8 receives these same tax breaks as it is not a pure EV (couldn't find any info online about it).

Btw, I love the i8 but the two cars are just not comparable.

[To quote an article:](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-1677034/Two-year-warranty-EU-law.html)

&gt; Under UK law, buyers in England and Wales can get a partial refund or full repair up to six years after the purchase was made (five years from discovery in Scotland). The refund should take into account how much use the customer has already had of a product. Ultimately, a county court would decide this.

&gt; However, the likelihood of getting such a refund is dramatically reduced after just six months. The reason is that for six months after the purchase, it is up to the retailer to show that a fault on an item is down to the actions or misuse of the buyer, rather than an inherent fault in the product.

&gt; After six months, the burden of proof switches to the buyer and it is they who must then show a fault is due to some inherent problem, something that can be almost impossible in all but the most straightforward cases. 

This brings the kind of odd scenario where consumers have to prove a fault with the product yet in the case of a lot of products they have seals that if broken would void the warranty and I am sure the company would claim you breaking it led to the fault in the first place, so how are you supposed to prove it? Not to mention that given the complexity of most items it is completely unreasonable to expect the consumer to be able to understand the cause of the fault, there is a reason those seals exist and that is to stop people screwing it up.

Features:


* Functionality for new soldier voice packs is in game. Completed voicepacks that will be included in B15 release: British English Male (3), Irish Male (1), Australian Female (1), Australian Male (2), SE Asian Male (1). Voicepacks will be assigned to soldiers of the appropriate nationality and may manually be assigned to any soldier of the designated gender. More voicepacks are in production and this list will be updated when they are complete. Many props to Long War Sound Editor TrackTwo for his tireless efforts getting this working, and special thanks to Firaxis, who helped us with some processing settings to get the voicepacks sounding similar to the vanilla ones.
* A new bonuses system is in place: 1) Players may choose from a number of starting bonuses tied to which of the 16 council countries you put your first satellite. You have multiple options for some countries. The bonuses aren't balanced against each other, so to some degree this is a way to play a somewhat customized campaign. 2) When launching a satellite, a player gains a specific country bonus. These are less powerful than the starter bonuses, and some of the countries that offer less monthly $$ have stronger bonuses to make them attractive. Some costs were rebalanced in light of bonuses now available. 3) Continent bonuses are now gained with ONLY full satellite coverage over all countries on the continent. Some have been rebalanced and the OTS discount is no longer tied to any continent. The strength of each bonus, and the country assignment, can be modified in DGC.ini.
* XCOM will draw soldiers from roughly 90 new countries (with unique flags) in addition to the existing group, with dozens of new namelists by Uzifeline. Countries include all of Europe (save microstates) and South America, with almost all of Central America and Asia, and lots of African countries. And New Zealand. Players can still control frequency of all countries providing soldiers with ini edits. Van Doorn gets UN flag, because he really represents all of us. SHIVs get XCOM flag in strategy game lists.
* Major overhaul to Not-So-Long-War, which has been renamed Dyanmic War. Instead of planning missions monthly, with this option the aliens will check supply and threat to launch most missions constantly. This allows mission frequency in NSLW to be tunable with the ini setting -- even setting it to 1.0 will provide a different feel than regular LW, as missions per month isn't set, but probabilistic (although the variables are set to *on average* generate the same mission count if set to 1.0). You can set it to .3 for a much shorter campaign, or above 1 for even greater mission density.
* You can now build seven MEC suits. MEC-1 is tier one, MEC-2 and MEC-3 are tier 2, and MEC-4 through MEC-7 are tier 3. They split along survivability/mobility lines and some grant body shield or jet boot module perks. MEC suit bonus will has gone down somewhat, and some MEC perk trees significantly reworked.
* Critical wound bleed out timer now randomized between 2 and 5 turns. The timer is concealed to the player.
* Respirator implant item now does the following: (in addition to strangle and partial acid immunity) 1) Causes first death of mission to instead automatically be a critical wound; 2) Adds 2 turns to bleed out timer; 3) Transmits bleed-out timer data to central. It does not prevent will loss. Raised price for item.
* Long War classes have distinct icons now
* You can always enter build facility detail screen for readout on requirements, even if you have insufficient resources for build
* Commander's Choice (pick each soldier class) now available as a Second Wave option. Removed ""Alternate Sources"" SW option. Thanks to Peasly Wellbott for letting us pick this up.
* Missions that can expire now have a countdown timer on the Geoscape UI. Geoscape will also pause when a mission is about to expire.
* Activated Tandem Warheads perk, which causes explosives to do full regular and environmental damage to the extent of their area of effect. This will be a high-level perk appearing on the Rocketeer, Engineer and Archer trees.
* Added UFO Scanners foundry project. This is an upgrade for your interceptors that will show precise damage taken by UFOs in air combat (using XMarksTheSpot's new interception UI mod) If you have already completed the analysis of the UFO class you are facing.
* Small items that grant non-perk bonuses (like Ceramic Plating or Armor Piercing Ammo) will now be described in your F1 HUD in tactical and have an icon with all your perks on the main tactical screen. You'll see a bit of doubling up of icons, 'cause we're out.
* Individual aliens and Exalts with certain perks will show different names in F1 detail if you have autopsied the species, giving a clue to their capabilities (and providing some flavor). eg Mutons with ""Covering Fire"" will be called ""Muton Sentry"" unless they have a stronger perk that takes precedence.
* Spruced up the MEC conversion UI.
* Reinstituted MEC repair and added repair of regular soldier items. Many items can now be damaged during (technically, after) combat and will have an increasing chance of needing repair following combat based on how many 'true' (non-armor) hp a soldier has lost. (Items will always function for the duration of a battle.) Armor, weapons, and small items that aren't infinite or fundamentally consumable (like grenades and ammo) are in the mix, although the chances they'll need repair is capped even if a soldier is killed varying on how likely something is to get damaged (armor=higher chances; pistol=lower chances, etc). Cybernetics Lab is now called ""Repair Bay,"" is much cheaper, and may be built from campaign start. Cost to repair an item is initially set of 20% cash, meld, alloy and elerium cost, and a formula for time to repair is also in place that starts with a baseline of 60% of build time but goes down as you develop Advanced Repair and add engineers to your staff (minimum is 72 hours). The following items are ini-adjustable: repair time% of baseline build time, resource cost as% of baseline resource cost, and you can turn off repair requirements entirely with one variable. Removed Second Wave option ""More than Human"" and replaced with Wear and Tear, which gives a chance that items will be damaged on missions and require repairs even when a soldier isn't hurt. The chance is initially set at 20% per item, and this value is ini-moddable. Many item costs are being adjusted downward to make up for reduced utility when they are in the shop.

Compared to how jurisprudence worked before the era I'm talking about? I actually don't think so. Early modern definitions of the inviolate bodies of political prisoners produced some of the most striking early discourses of human rights.

Those societies also created and supported critiques of colonialism (de la Casas comes to mind). But honestly this is now out of my real depth so I cant argue against your first point any better.

Since we're being all decidedly European when talking about reactionary and revolutionary impulses, I think a better example of a utilitarian reactionary movement would be the Ming dynasty China, which, though it changed the productive capacity of Chinese civilization, actually preserved the status quo with more rigor than European civilizations of the same period. And that meant a higher quality of life for a huge portion of citizens (though obviously supported by a pretty sizeable agricultural population).

**Having said all that** I don't actually think labor movements WILL have a quiet place in history books, all things considered. 

I'm also not backing down from my original contention that a ""golden age"" or an increase in the quality of life or even drastic changes to a society are *always* revolutionary political movements and never reactionary.

How was I still alive?

I stood in a smoking crater, largely undamaged, despite the destruction around me. Cars burned. People screamed. Water leaked from exposed pipes, slowly flooding the crater and soaking my ankles. Sirens grew steadily closer. But I couldn't really notice any of that. *I should be dead.*

I thought back to moments before. The flash in the sky, the shadows moving under my feet before I looked up, and the meteor, a foot from my head. That was the last thing I remembered. I came to my senses in this crater. 

I looked around to see people dotting the rim of the crater. I reasoned that I should probably get out of the way, and try to climb out of the-

Hang on. How did I get here, now? I was standing behind the crowd now, out of the crater. Those gathered gasped and some shrieked when they noticed me behind them. But *how?* How did I do that? I wanted to be here, and I appeared here. And that meteor... I could have sworn it was aimed right at me, and yet other than some torn clothing, I was fine. More than fine. I felt great! 

The crowd backed away but I didn't care. I was giddy. Could it be? Oh, please don't be a dream. I've always wanted this. Super powers? Please be real. More screaming from the crowd interrupted my thoughts. I glanced around and noticed I was about twenty feet off the ground. 

I was flying. I. Was. Flying. *Flying.* Me. I let out an involuntary whoop of joy and sped off into the sky, with such speed the clouds burst as I flew through them. I pushed myself, testing my limits, but I couldn't reach them. I never found my top speed. I paused, checking my surroundings. I saw cities below, and mountains. Maybe a coastline? Where could this be? I flew higher, arriving at the edge of the atmosphere and looked down to see the whole of Western Europe below me. 

""Nice."" I said aloud, noting that my voice sounded strange in the thin atmosphere at this altitude. After thinking for a moment I decided to check how I handled space. I inched closer and closer to the edge, watching the horizon change and the stars come into clearer focus. I could tell when I left the last of Earth's air behind, but it didn't matter. I could still breathe! Or, well, maybe I just didn't need to. It's not like my lungs were filling and deflating up here. 

I rolled over and watched the Earth go by for a while, then thought of going home. Wondering what was happening on that street.

Suddenly, I was there. Flight? No, no, too fast for that. A thrill shot up my spine. Flight *and* teleportation?! I didn't have time to dwell on this, however, as I noticed things had changed since I last saw the impact site. Police and fire crews dotted the rim of the crater, news vans held back by deputies while SWAT members and K9 units patrolled the deeper parts of the hole. 

""That's him!"" A woman's shrill voice pierced the confusion. ""He's the one who flew out of it!"" A spotlight hit me. A helicopter above was closing fast and cops from all sides begin closing in.

My natural response was fear, as I had once been wrongfully arrested for arson and was treated like scum by the local police before they realized their mistake. Not again, not again... but something inside me made me laugh, and I lost all trace of fear immediately. That's right... I have nothing to worry about from them!

The realization prompted a new urge. An urge to have some fun.

""Get down on the ground, and put your hands on your head!"" cape a voice from the helicopter's loudspeaker. I looked up, squinting through the glare of the spotlight, and flipped my middle finger at them. Then vanished. I teleported into the helicopter, grabbed the controls and forced the craft into a dive, shoving the passengers out before impact. I jumped at the last second, only to be snagged by my tattered clothes! 

BOOM!

The helicopter hit hard and flames spread immediately through the wreckage. It took me a second to realize what had happened, and that I was fine. I calmly walked out of the wreckage, the flames disposing of the rest of my clothes. But what need was there for modesty now? After all, I was basically a g-

WHAM! Something hit me from the side, knocking me over. A German Shepherd, its teeth latched onto my arm. I noticed that the dog was holding me very still. I wondered why until I realized the dog was simply too weak to budge me. Or, more accurately, I was too strong. I flexed a few times, watching the dog's mouth open and close along with the pulsing. I chuckled, then freed my arm and got to my feet. After all, this pup wasn't the only officer giving me trouble. 

I saw a team of ten SWAT members in full riot gear approaching. The rest of the police force were sheltered behind their vehicles, weapons drawn. Dozens of radios crackled incoherently. Orders were shouted and the other K9s barked and growled. But through it all, it was like everything was on mute, or happening in slow motion. 

No, wait. Everything *was* moving in slow motion! This was getting better and better! I wondered briefly if powers would continue to manifest or if my total would be flight, teleportation, invulnerability, super strength, and super speed. I figured I'd find out eventually. For now... let's handle these riot police.

At my speed, they were almost statues. I could still tell I was moving fast, but I was thinking at the same speed, and so making decisions at speed was easy. I ran up between two cops, swifly sliding my hands to their utility belts and relieving them of their tear gas canisters. I tossed them up and they seemed to hover in front of each man's face, slowing once they left my touch. I repeated my motion towards their belts, this time taking their handcuffs and chaining them together at the waist. Finally, spinning a 180 so I was facing the same direction as them, I stole and slammed their nightsticks clean through each tear gas can. Right before they exploded, I vanished.

At normal speed, all anyone saw was a blur, with a sudden explosion of gas obscuring the rest. In their effort to escape the gas, the two officers collided with each other and the other members of their team, forcing all ten to choke and cough in the smoke. I chuckled from the front seat of a nearby squad car before flooring it, sending it careening into the crater. I teleported out and into another car, and another, crashing all of them in a matter of seconds. No one knew where I was, so everyone was in chaos. I couldn't help but laugh.

My laughter must have notified a young rookie of my location, because I suddenly felt her cold gun barrel pressed against my temple. I stopped laughing. Maybe it was time to stop playing around. I mean it's not like I wanted to start a war. But this *power!* It was so intoxicating. I vanished again and appeared behind the officer, who was radioing for assistance in arresting me. I kicked her in the hip gently, sending her flailing into the night. The others had found me thanks to her. Damn it. Oh well. 

Hm... I reached in my pocket and pulled out some change, wanting to test a theory. I glanced up at the approaching cops, but they didn't really interest me anymore. I spread the coins out in my hand and concentrated. Sure enough, they slowly began to levitate. Awesome. Telekinesis. 

I turned to the cops and tried to knock them back with this new power. I didn't want them hurt, but I also didn't want to get shot. Instead, they all froze, dropped their guns, and sat down, blank looks on their faces. The moment I stopped concentrating they began to get up. Holy... I had telepathy too, it seemed.

In fact, it seemed like I was developing powers as quickly as I could think of them. I grinned. And now, I could think *very*  fast.  I cracked my knuckles. 

""Let's see what I can *really* do."" I said to myself.

Freedom of speech is a right everyone is supposed to have, yea? If some people didn't,  it wouldn't be a right - but a privilege. Now, when people are allowed to say oppressive shit, they aren't just speaking their minds; they are creating a platform for hatred.

That's not nice in general; however, what ends up happening is that whoever is targeted by this oppressive speech is likely to be marginalized, and silenced. If you're reminded every day about how inferior your race is, or how you and the adherents of your religion should leave/be persecuted/die, or how people with your gender identity should live subordinate to another, or, worse, that your gender identity isn't even *real*, or anything else, you're less likely to speak up when it matters.

After all, nobody is going to take you seriously, and you might just get a bash back from members of the majority who aren't used to hearing your voice. Or, worse still, you might not even be saying anything, and some bigot comes along and hurts you for simply being something they don't like (and something that you often can't control).

*This* is what is meant when Europeans say that hate speech laws make people free. They prevent the use of expression to keep entire (vulnerable) groups of people silent.

I dont think that Japan formally divided the peninsula in any way, the terrain just naturally created a situation where mining became a big part of the northern half of the peninsula's economy because there were minerals there and the had less of them and was left mostly with agriculture at the beginning - then after the war had to develop industries that depended more on adding value and less on, say large amounts of metals or large numbers of people working for very low wages..

I think the model for the division of korea along the 38th parallel between the West and Eastern spheres of influence was Europe - the division was one of the most sordid backroom deals ever, IMO. basically the ""Big Three"" agreed to the division of Europe, which was sketched out on a cocktail napkin. 

Also, it should be said that the ex USSR did not join the war against Japan until AFTER the atom bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese surrender was imminent. Literally just a few days before the Japanese surrender. Also, Kim Il Sung was hand picked by Stalin to run the government that was established, he was not already leading the country, he was an officer in the Red Army (the Soviet Army) Initially there was a provisional government that was leading perhaps towards a united Korea but both of the two big parties opposed it and wanted to set up people who would be more favorable to them. In that respect both the US and the ex-USSR screwed up. It should be noted that Korea under the Japanese was kept free of capable leaders by intention.. similar to Songbun in the North today.

So- Kim Il Sung was a Russian officer and Syngman Rhee was a Korean-American who had spent the previous 20 years living in the US.

&gt;*""Initially the North had a distinct advantage, pushing three quarters of the way down the peninsula. They were eventually pushed back to the 38th parallel, where they eventually signed a cease fire. So beginning the longest running war in history.""*

Didn't the UN forces push almost all the way to China, leading China to enter the war? I think that the only part of Korea that the Kimist forces were still in possession of at that point was North Hamgyong Province. 

One of the reason the war was so bitter is that many places in Korea changed hands multiple times, and both sides were really merciless in killing people who had collaborated with the other sides (and their immediate relatives.) 

After the war Kim Il Sung immediately got to work compiling lists of people whose allegiances had not been well defined in the war (most people who were known to have helped the other side were killed) the first big purge was in 1956 - people who had been associated with the USSR, China and Communists who had fled north during and after the war were purged. (they probably knew too much about real history, had friends and acquaintances overseas, which Kim saw as a threat, and stood in the way of the fanciful remaking of the past to glorify Kim Il Sung's role in the opposition to the Japanese to the exclusion of other guerrilla fighters against the Japanese.)",,cp2f97v,False,0,False,1427546026,t1_cp26jmx,2,northkorea,,t1_cp2f97v,1425344004,t5_2r16c,,0

Frankly if you sleep with them its probably not going to work because of jealousy and wanting more and a thing called attraction which leads to the crazy actions of jealousy and fear. This is why so many open relationships fail, one partner wants more communication and closeness and the sex makes things go down hill that aren't solid. I do believe one can be friends after dating or sleeping with someone but not if they mix up the roles and the openness of unconditional friendship, the relationship evolves. This takes a very emotionally and mature person of say a ex partner of many years who care about you but will keep boundaries. 

A true friend will be there to pick up the pieces when guys are dicks, they are your support when men hurt you. In some ways they are more important than a husband because what if that goes wrong, then what (hopefully they will be there for you). Personally I never have sex with my friends because that ruins things and would become a major issue in being comfortable, without walls while not fearing rejection or the consequences. While my friends are attractive to some people (just not me), I can't have the guys I would be all crazy for around me that just isn't the right basis for a friendship. This has helped me because they know what we have is only the strong bond of friendship without any hidden agendas. I am sure there are some who can sleep with their friends, and only keep hot guys around them. But it makes me wonder if those guys where ever their true friends and if they are limiting the simple uncomplicated intimacy of the friendship. 

This is also why I have so many female and male straight friends, the sexual tension of relativity makes things less complicated and easier to navigate, they are there simply because they enjoy my company. This is why straight males can have bro relationships that are so strong they even seem gay, its all the intimacy without the sex ruining it. Even in the straight world a dude is with a female, she gets emotionally attached, few are best friends with them as it complicates things, they go to their bros for support. 

Being brought up in a conservative environment as well I think that has made you fetishize this relationship. Its what the conservatives think when they think of gay friends. Look at European countries these guy friends have no fear of nudity or other elements like holding hands, sleeping together, kissing, and they are judge friends, Americans get all crazy about the way men should behave and what is culturally acceptable to be male. Sex is a different level of intimacy look at Grindr all these dudes do not want to talk after messing around once. 90% of the problems on Askgaybros are dealing with issues of human sexuality, so yes i don't think that makes a good point of sleeping with a friend. 

While love between friends is a mutual, self-sacrificing arrangement, agape, romantic love includes an element of self-serving love as well, eros. Romantic love includes the desire to receive love back from the other in a way that does not involve a mutual arrangement or sacrifice of the self.

In other words friendship would be a ""I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine."" Romantic love would be more like ""I'll scratch your back, if you blow me.""

&gt;&gt;From:  http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2013/04/26/how-does-sex-differ-from-intimacy/

&gt;&gt;Intimacy is at the heart of a strong relationship. Intimacy is about knowing someone deeply and being able to be completely free in that person’s presence. It is an emotional state that is often reserved for just one person. Ideally, sex in a loving relationship should be the physical embodiment of intimacy. It should come from a place of love and connection. Within a relationship the two are inextricably linked: intimacy builds sex and sex builds intimacy.1

&gt;&gt;However, sex also is just a physical act. Within a relationship, sex is the most intimate act, but it can also be an act without consent, an act which is paid for, or a mere physical exchange. A one-night stand is a perfect example of sex without an intimate relationship. Both men and women can enjoy the sex of a one-night stand, but it is a physical act rather than a loving act.2 On the other hand, it can be argued that there is nothing more intimate than vulnerably offering yourself to someone in the physical act of sex, therefore connecting the two terms again, even in the case of a one-night stand.",,cp2fumd,False,0,False,1427546303,t3_2xodyv,1,askgaybros,,t1_cp2fumd,1425345111,t5_2vgfw,,0

I'm not saying anything about how to improve growth. I agree that less spending more or less by definition leads to lower GDP.

My point in a way is similar to yours: that pushing money around is no longer an effective way to 'energize' the business sector.

Your opinion is that businesses don't want capital because their outlook for the future is so sour. My opinion is that at least part of what is driving the lower interest rates is that more and more businesses simply don't need large sums of capital to be successful. There is no reason that these two things can't happen concurrently.

A major reason why I think a 'naturally falling demand for capital' is part of the story, is that low interest rates are becoming a global phenomenon not just a European one. 

Europeans might be the first to have negative interest rates in part because of a failing economy, but rates are near zero in the US and Japan as well and have been for quite some time.

Yeah, no. If you go by official numbers from Europol, and other organizations you'll find that Islamic terrorist attacks are insignificantly small numbered when compared to non-Islamic terrorist attacks within the US and Europe. The majority of terrorist attacks that are done by Muslims is in Muslim countries in which Muslims are the victims. This has nothing to do with religion or the fact that they themselves or their victims are Muslim. These are all political of nature.

It's funny how the focus is always on *terrorist* attacks in order to judge and define whether a group/culture/religion/race is violent or not.

No, naturally not. They are a tiny minority, maybe, but they are still part of the *ethnic* majority because their ethnicity was redefined to ""Caucasian"". Ethnicity is flexible. There is no reason to fear being persecuted by immigrant majorities so long as they are being assimilated and integrated into your society.

&gt; I've seen studies that show more homogeneous populations have more social cohesion.

Valid! But that only applies to countries that were always homogenous and are still homogenous. For example, America has been a nation of immigrants forever. We never enjoyed the benefits of this homogeneity so we can't pretend restricting immigration will maintain a homogeneity we never had. Same for European countries that are currently diverse. Maybe they were homogenous fifty years ago, but they aren't homogenous now, and you can't possibly imagine ... what? Mass expulsions, genocide? would be for social harmony. 

&gt; this makes sense, the more related you are to someone the more helpful you'll be to them.

But we don't have gene-sharing sniffers in our noses. It's possible that conscious awareness of family relationships makes us care about close kin, but mostly it is learning - you love the people you grow up with. Everyone else might as well be from the opposite side of the earth.

What you *might* have read was something about how genetic homogeneity (slowly, over a very long time) promoted altruism, because if an altruist is surrounded by other people who have the same altruism gene, it protects the gene even if he has to sacrifice his family's welfare. This is still hypothetical, but it doesn't predict altruistic people stop being altruistic to strangers.

  America funded and armed rebels, disbanded armies who then formed their own militias- including ISIS. America can clean it up, they have the massive budgets to find it. Shit, they spend more money on military firepower than health and education. 

  As to the rest of the middle east, there's more to it than Iraq/Syria/Afghanistan. Jordan is a stable nation with a diverse population. Iran just elected a new President last year with NO violence.

Firstly blink haven't been pop punk for a long time. Secondly it's a time to money ratio, he'd have to put a fair amount of effort in to make a new blink album. Touring with blink is a lot of cash for minimal effort, hence why Tom was happy stringing both the fans and his bandmates along for three years only doing shows and pushing the album back over and over again.

I don't hate Tom but can people stop acting like he left blink after admitting his heart wasn't in it? He was ousted from the band by two band mates sick of his shit. He even said in his original message he was in the process of booking blink for something in New York (probably needed money to fund a new AVA comic that no one will buy, and that's coming from a huge AVA fan).

I'm not saying Mark and Travis are innocent, Tom's letter to the fans proves that, but seriously Tom clearly didn't want to do blink any more but he was more than happy to keep playing shows and disappointing fans. That's pathetic in my eyes.

I don't think you realise how much money there is in touring, particularly for a huge band like blink. Tom probably made more money on the Europe 2014 Tour last summer than he's made on every single AVA show combined. Tom was keeping blink as his little cash cow. 

Tom was happy to continue to play in blink for the cash, and really only put effort into the project he cares about. OP I can't anything you said seriously.

It is not to be found anywhere in the universe but for some reason people act as if such a thing could somehow exist. Prices reflect the availabilities of things that we actually can have, so maybe we should all stop searching for chimera of stability and accept that if the world is unstable, than prices ought to be unstable too. Otherwise prices could not serve the function of enabling people to coordinate the allocation of scarce resources.

**[National Gallery of Australia:](http://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=150967)**

* Sydney Long advocated in a 1905 journal article for an Australian art that would convey the ‘lonely and primitive feeling of this country’. He was among the first generation of non-Indigenous, Australian-born artists to engage with the Australian landscape in an innovative way.

 Long drew on the decorative European influences of Art Nouveau and Symbolism to express a sense of spiritual presence in the landscape. In Flamingoes, he simplified the sinuous forms of slender eucalypts in an aesthetic response to the light, colour and mood of the bush, creating an otherworldly Australian setting for these graceful, highly coloured exotic birds.
 




* Sydney Long was the leading proponent of the Art Nouveau style in Australian art at the turn of the century. From the late 1890s he developed his unique vision of the Australian landscape using the stylistic devices of the English Aesthetic Movement, which valued the beauty in objects.

 Long was passionate about Australian subject matter, and his eucalypts, tea-trees and open plains are sometimes inhabited by distinctly Australian fauna, such as magpies, as well as by the nymphs and fauns of Greek myths. He did, however, also depict non-Australian subject matter, as in Flamingoes.

 Long had observed flamingoes at Taronga Park Zoo in Sydney, and he returned to the subject many times. In Flamingoes he transformed the visual realities of the landscape into a simplified and flattened composition resembling a frieze. Drawing on the Art Nouveau style, the graceful curves of the birds are silhouetted against a backdrop of highly stylised trees, and their forms are strongly modelled to give them a sharp reality. Their sinuous necks are highly suited to the flowing organic lines and sensuality of Long’s Art Nouveau approach.",,cp2inrq,False,0,False,1427547614,t3_2xqqg1,2,museum,,t1_cp2inrq,1425350117,t5_2rti0,,0

The Jewish calendar is based on their belief in the date of creation. The Muslim calendar is based on year of the hegira (the flight of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina.) The Christian calendar is based on the year Jesus Christ was born (or was so proposed at the time).

The first utilization of the BC/AD notation was by Dionysius Exiguus, a Scythian monk in 525. The method he used to ascertain 525 years since the birth of Jesus is unknown, but since this is ELI5, let's just call it an educated guess.

In the 731 work Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Saint Bede the Venerable used and popularized the BC/AD notation. The date system soon became widespread across all western Europe, and since western Europe was a focal point of culture, trade, and imperialism for well over a millennium, the calendar they used became the calendar the world used.

Modern historians, archaeologists, and religious scholars agree the birth of Jesus Christ was actually somewhere between the years 6 and 4 BC, marginally but notably earlier than what was hypothesized by Dionysius Exiguus.

I come from a small island in the netherlands with no real job opportunity and no decent education. Almost everyone who works here, does so in the tourism sector. Practically nothing you would need a higher education for. As a result, all of the intelligent and more ambitious young adults have to move to the mainland for their jobs and higher education. It's a community of almost all white europeans, with their own brand of islander culture. Proud to be an islander. About 3000 people live there, spread among four villages. Almost everyone is white. I have a friend who came to the island a while ago to work as a chef in a restaurant, and he tells me one of the first things he noticed was the low intelligence of the islanders. I used to work with a guy who was a notable moron, and have even more examples from when I went to school there.

Speaking of the school, it gave the bottom three secondary education levels out of the four that exist in the netherlands. The very bottom level had about 15 people in my year, the second from the bottom had closer to 20-25. I was on the higher third level, which only had a measly 6 students.

I take it that you are Argentine? As fluent in Spanish, I believe both parties should try to just speak portunhol when they meet, that would be much easier than falling back to English, which usually neither party dominates.

People in Brazil all use teamspeak, at least mostly. One possibility is that they sound OK on TS but badly in game. Or simply because they are not aware for whatever reason, that they sound loud.

As for the getting along problem, it's the same in Europe, as well, with Russian players that don't speak English. Brazilian are the majority in SA, therefore they kind of demand that whomever plays with them to play along, just like in Europe, where people demand you speak English.

By the way, I bet you have a big ego, like everyone else that thinks their case is special, and what happens to them doesn't happen somewhere else.

(In the UK I'd actually say xenophobia is the problem, not racism) I live in an area of London/Kent where it's a very big deal. The spot where Lee Rigby was murdered is a 5-10 minute drive away from my house and that's in a very multicultural area. 30-40 minutes in the other direction and you're in a part of Kent where UKIP and the BNP have gained a hell of a lot of support. Rochester in particular was recently the centre of attention for UKIP after the regions MP defected to them from the Tories. IIRC the BNP were even based in my town (Welling) for some time and Anjem Choudhary grew up here.

I still take offence to statements like ""Europe is super racist ... Everyone hates each other, and they all hate the immigrants. And all of them hate gypsies"" and the fact that I refute them does not mean I believe Europe is some sort of liberal utopia where everyone gets along. Even if I was to claim that Europe was the least racist continent (which I don't believe because of countries like Hungary, Greece, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Serbia etc) that still wouldn't even mean I'm pretending racism isn't a problem here.

When you go to a doctor of any kind they have to file insurance paperwork and for that they need a dsm code (in the US, in Europe it's an ICD code) and so that happens first visit. In the case of a psychiatrist it might be a preliminary diagnosis idk. That's not how I work. I have to have a diagnosis to begin with. And so that gets filed immediately. And it goes to the insurance company so the doctor gets paid. And from there it goes into the big data storm I was talking about and becomes part of your ""permanent file"" which they talked about in school but they couldn't create. This is your permanent file. It's all your health data. 

So even if you are as good as you think you are at computer hacking. You'd have to hack a lot higher than your psychiatrist's office. And you'd have to know what manner of billing he used and who saw it and how they processed it and when. It's way more complex than just his notes. 

As for a second opinion, you could certainly do that. But I don't think it will get you what you want. It might mitigate the damage when the DOD finds the personality disorder maybe. But your problem is going to be when they find all the proof backing up that you are antisocial too. They are going to find the federal crime. I don't know why you think they won't. But anyway, claiming your current diagnosis is a mistake isn't likely to work because it's ASPD and anything you do is going to be colored by the lying and manipulation. But you are certainly within your rights to try it. Maybe you got a dr who is prone to seeing ASPD everywhere. (But it's still not going to remove the first diagnosis, however if you had another dr write a dissenting opinion that might make the DOD ignore it when they find it.)

Records aren't sealed to the DOD. You should have been made aware of that when you signed for the scholarship. They can and do look at everything. And they will. Nothing is off limits to the DOD. Nothing. 

Most people do not cheat at the level you cheat at. You are a criminal. You were trying to cheat at college and you were trying to seek drugs with the intent of selling them. And you saw a psych for what was probably five weeks. At least 5 hours. That's dedicated criminal activity. I know you don't want to hear it but I think the psychiatrist was likely correct. You are a criminal from before age 15, you lie and manipulate, you violate the rights of others, you show no remorse, and you are impulsive. It's kind of all there. You should at least think about it separate from your current concern.

of literature and other art forms through the

modern European language.

I remember learning Irish in school. It was painful. Like most Irish kids, I learned to hate the language. I think they should consider changing Irish class into an Irish culture class. It could be a mix of old Irish stories and myths, Irish music and dancing, Irish history, the Irish language, Irish sports, etc. Basically foster a positive attitude towards Irish culture and encourage children to be proud of who they are. 
Perhaps a non-compulsory Irish class could be offered, similar to Applied Maths. If the Irish class got a reputation for being ""easy"" in the Leaving Cert, it would be popular and perhaps the language would be seen more favourably.

country, though there has been some softening in the numbers who hold this view strongly.
Most reject the argument that such attacks are the only way to get the US to listen to the
Islamic people and a growing percentage perceive them as an ineffective method for achieving
political ends. As a general principle large majorities reject the use of violent methods such as
bombings and assassinations to achieve political goals.

# Chinese Rushing to Buy Property for Portugal Visas Get Burned

by Henrique Almeida

(Bloomberg) -- Billboards in Chinese at Lisbon’s international airport peddling luxury properties leave little doubt about who is buying real estate in Portugal.
While the ads offer a chance at securing a so-called golden visa to live in Portugal in exchange for property investments of at least 500,000 euros ($559,000), they leave out the golden rule of such purchases: never rush into a deal.

The haste with which some Chinese buyers have acquired their piece of Portugal has left them feeling cheated once they realize they might have struck better deals. Some may even have been victims of middlemen who charge commissions of as much as a quarter of the value of the transaction.

“Many Chinese land in Portugal for the first time, don’t speak the language and buy a home in a matter of days,” said Y Ping Chow, head of the Chinese League in Portugal, a Lisbon-based group that promotes the Chinese community. “Some of these investors got burned.”
Portugal can’t afford to leave a sour taste in the mouth of Chinese investors. The golden-visa program, which began in late 2012 while the country, like much of Europe, was in the throes of the financial crisis, has raked in more than one billion euros in much-needed investment, mainly from Chinese property buyers, according to the country’s foreign ministry.

The Chinese accounted for more than 80 percent of the 1,526 resident permits issued under the program last year, according to the ministry.

Tightening Controls

To ensure foreign investors continue buying property in the country through the golden visa program, the government announced plans on Feb. 23 to tighten controls over the issuance of resident permits, including a closer monitoring of real estate prices. That came after a probe into allegations of corruption, influence peddling and money laundering linked to the golden visas led to 11 detentions.

“The aim is to improve this program,” Vice Premier Paulo Portas said at a press conference in Lisbon. “There are 13 other EU countries with similar investor programs and it doesn’t seem wise to give up this program to the benefit of others.”

Keeping the program going will mean convincing potential property buyers that they won’t meet the fate of Hua Guiping.

Hua, 47, flew from Shanghai to Lisbon in 2013. In less than a week after her arrival, she agreed to buy a home for 500,000 euros before moving to Portugal with her husband and daughter.
Bracketed by an interpreter on one side and a real estate agent on the other, Hua visited dozens of homes in two days before agreeing to buy a house at The Arrabida Resort and Golf Academy, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Lisbon.

‘Excellent Deal’

“While none of the houses that I visited pleased me, the seller insisted the price was very low and that in two years it would rise to one million euros,” Hua said in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg News. “I agreed to buy the house and returned to China feeling happy because I thought I had made an excellent deal.”

A few months later, while browsing the Internet, Hua learned that some of the homes in the same resort were on sale online for less than half the price she had paid.

“I saw that houses in the same area were valued at 210,000 euros to 250,000 euros while my home was sold for more than twice that value,” said Hua. “I’m truly upset by all this.”

Several online real estate listings show prices for similar three-bedroom properties in the same resort ranging from 220,000 euros to 515,000 euros.

Pelicano-Investimento Imobiliario SA, the company that owned the house Hua agreed to buy, denies that it sold the property at above market prices.

Price Policy

Some properties are being sold at lower prices because they have been repossessed by banks or belong to individuals looking to repay debts, Pelicano said in a statement on Feb. 10.

“The Arrabida Resort and Golf Academy has more than 1,000 residential units, most of which have been bought by foreign clients with different nationalities who are totally satisfied with the acquisition,” the Lisbon-based company said. Pelicano has “total legitimacy and liberty to define its price policy and the potential buyers are free to decide whether or not to buy these properties.”

Sergio Martins, director-general of the Portuguese-Chinese Business Chamber of Commerce, is aware of complaints by some Chinese of overpaying for properties in Portugal.

“This happens because some unusual mediators tend to be involved in these transactions, emigration agencies and more than one real estate agency in Portugal and China, plus lawyers and other consultancy services,” Martins said in an interview on Feb. 10. “Commissions can sometimes rise to as much as 25 percent of the real estate transaction.”

Necessary Research

Unlike Hua, Rex Shen spent months researching home prices in Portugal before using up most of the money he saved working as a casino manager in Macau to buy two apartments almost 7,000 miles away in the center of Lisbon. He cut out middlemen and paid almost no commissions.

Shen now works as a real estate agent in the Portuguese capital selling properties to his fellow countrymen.
“A smart Chinese investor should do the necessary research before coming to Portugal,” Shen said in a telephone interview on Feb. 25. “It’s a free market and some real estate agents in Portugal are indeed selling properties at very high prices.”

Demand from Chinese property buyers remains strong as China continues to allow a freer movement of funds in and out of the country. About 90 percent of bidders at a real estate auction of government-owned apartments in Lisbon last year were Chinese.

Difficult Time

The Chinese came “at a difficult time for Portugal, when many didn’t believe that the country could face and overcome the crisis,” Antonio Costa, the mayor of Lisbon and leader of Portugal’s Socialist Party, said on Feb. 19. They made a “big contribution to Portugal’s ability to be in the situation it’s in today, very different from where we were four years ago.”

Foreigners accounted for 90 percent of the 730 million euros invested in Portuguese real estate last year, almost three times more than in 2013, according to data compiled by Aguirre Newman SA, a real estate consulting company in Lisbon. The Portuguese government expects economic growth to accelerate to 1.5 percent this year from an estimated 1 percent last year, bolstered by exports and investment.

That’s why Portugal should treat foreign investors well, said Paulo Silva, head of Aguirre Newman in Portugal. Some Chinese investors have trouble determining if they’re overpaying, he said.

“It’s hard to know if a house that costs 500,000 euros in Portugal is expensive when two parking spots in Hong Kong can easily fetch more than that,” said Silva. “That makes it important for Portugal to treat all foreign investors fairly or they will just move somewhere else.”

0,DictatorDan,55,False,t3_2xqbes,"Long story short: Putin wants to keep Ukraine (the second most populous and most important former Soviet republic) as weak and divided as possible--and as far out of NATO's sphere of influence as possible. He manufactured an election in the southernmost province of Crimea where the citizens voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia. The election results were fraudulent. The rest of Ukraine as split into two and are in a state of civil war. The western (agricultural) part of the country wanting closer ties to the EU, the eastern (industrial) part of the country wanting to maintain closer ties to Russia.  The eastern side has threatened to declare independence, but likely would not--because that would weaken Ukraine too much for Putin's taste. 

Now to the Russian troops.  Though Russia would never admit it, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that Russian soldiers are posing as eastern separatists to attack the Ukrainian government forces. Is this an act of war? Absofuckinglutely, but good luck convincing any government of that--it is in no one's interest for there to be an open and obvious war between Russia and a EU ally. And Putin knows that. And that is how he is getting away with it. 

The EU is supplying the government forces with weapons and nonlethal aide like medical supplies, communication devices, and intelligence. There has since be a ceasefire manufactured by Angela Merkel of Germany and Francois Hollande of France, with both sides cooling the tensions slightly. It should also be noted that Western Europe relies heavily on oil and natural gas from Russia, much of which is pumped through pipelines that run through Ukraine. 

You will see depictions of Putin as a power-hungry monster who just wants to enhance his own power and fuck shit up for everyone. Putin is not Hitler. He is the smartest person on the world stage and is taking advantage of a unique situation. Sure, the US and China could bully their neighbors into getting everything they want (and both certainly have and will continue to do so), but sending in troops and annexing territories is considered 20th century behavior. ""Decent"" people do not do that anymore. Putin laughs at this; human behavior did not change with the passing of Y2K. Russia has legitimate security concerns and Putin has illegitimate paranoia issues. Those two combine to explain his behavior. If you want the honest-to-god best depiction of Putin-the-man, watch Season 3 of House of Cards. Viktor Petrov. His initials are not a coincidence.

The blonde hair/blue eyes thing is often greatly exaggerated. Aryan was a somewhat broad term, and included most Western Europeans who weren't Jews, Slavs, Gypsies, etc. 

The Aryan race was divided into 5 subsets: Western (Mediterranean), Nordic, Eastern (Alpine), East Baltic and Dinaric races. (The Nordic subset is the one with blonde hair/blue eyes that confuses people)

If you had blonde hair/blue eyes you were Aryan, but just because you were Aryan didn't mean you had blonde hair blue eyes. Similar to how a square is a rectangle, but a rectangle isn't a square.

I personally would not have made a purchase from this vendor, or any vendor from the Netherlands (I personally do not make any international DNM purchases. Simply less headaches that way). But especially not this one, because of the tone in their profile and their vague and disadvantageous terms. I am also somewhat put off by their categorization of the US as a ""high risk nation"". US customs are not *significantly* more strict than say, the UK's or Germany's (Ireland's custom standards make the US's look like child's play, for instance)... except when it comes to packages *from* the Netherlands. 

I cannot comment on Australia's level customs scrutiny, as I am totally unfamiliar with it. I have heard that it is somewhat stricter than the US's and most European nations, but still, it's more to do with the fact that the Netherlands is considered a risky nation to buy from, and less to do with the US (and possibly Australia) being risky places to ship to.

At the same time though, this does not excuse this Vendor's behavior in this matter. Primarily because it seems as if they simply did not send the package, and then hid behind their vague terms, in an attempt to be slightly less obvious that they were screwing him.

Again, you bring up fair points. But it seems like this vendor should simply not ship to the US or Australia at all, instead of basically daring American and Australian customers to do business with them... since it seems they are basically using these customers as a way to conduct shady business with enough plausible deniability in their terms to cover their asses.

I think this is true of US, outside metropolitan areas. But in Europe and elsewhere - people are not as infatuated with their cars and view them more as a tool.

&gt; It also makes more economic sense

Cost of owning a car is about 60 cents / mile. And a huge part of it is paying off the cost of the car. As soon as the cost of roboTaxis drops below that line, the economics change. The decision point for most people would be in about 10 years, when they need to buy a new car or rely instead on roboTaxis. For the latter, the cost of the car is spread among all users, and over a lot more miles (the car is in use most of the day, not parked). Plus you don't have to worry about parking, the Autos can take the kids to soccer practice without Mom serving as their own personal Uber. etc.

In the city, Autos will create an instant, fantastic, public transport system. Which means most people will rely on it to get around. In the suburbs, initially people will drop from 2 cars to 1 car + roboTaxi (when the time comes to replace one of the cars), and after a while, when they see its great, they'll drop the second car as well.

Even if you did have a good figure at the height of the slave trade, it'd be difficult to do a direct comparison. A very large chunk of transatlantic slaves were sent to Latin America to work in the silver mines, where they had very short and brutal lives.

IIRC the movie is based on an anime which is based on a book. In the book one of the major characters is Asian. When the book was turned into an anime in Japan they changed that character into a white Caucasian European, which was then carried over into the movie. Someone who doesn't know the full story would assume the character change was another case of Hollywood being biased when really it was the Japanese who had made the single Asian character white. Reality is stranger than fiction!

Of course it is always possible to help development without resorting to races to the bottom.

This road belongs to you, but it's use belongs to the public. You are just as free to block this road, as you are to block the highway into the capital city.

If your roadblock causes injury, you should be held directly responsible without any mitigating factors. You knew before you bought your property that you also bought the heriditary taint.

Starbucks sell coffee in the UK. Fine. But they bought the beans elsewhere (like Ethiopia or something). Then they flew them or shipped them to Europe (let's say France). Maybe they then used a French logistics company to drive them to stores in the UK.

Their cups are made in China, and they probably buy them and import them.

And the company is American. Branding and marketing materials likely come from there.

So ok, they make a profit on a cup of coffee. And then they pay their staff, and the business rates for the building etc - but how on earth does anybody decide exactly how much tax they should pay, or what the British portion of the profit is? I really have no idea.

The good thing about that law is that it is very broadly worded. Basically, if it looks like your arrangement is designed to reduce tax (like purchasing through an Irish company), rather than making business sense (like buying beans from Ethiopia), you can get hit with it.

Do you?  
Is the world ending at 2020?  

Did you even read the article pertaining to the Ship sizes and container volumes?  This new canal will have 0 competition between the Atlantic and Pacific for the new generation of ships. **0**
This new canal won't be operational for a decade, 2030 is closer to its operational date than today is. And it won't be shut down 10 years after either. 

Latin and South America is a growth region with population growth rates which are not like that of Europe or Japan. There are going to be people there and there is going to be massive trade between them and the Largest population growth region on the face of the earth in Africa.  

Pacific is the new Atlantic. Why do think there is all that hoopla over the TPP, its because its the future ocean.  The trade is not stopping, its only going to increase and it can't just rely on 1 choke point which can't even handle current state of the art ships let alone ones on the design table and those who will be made 3 decades from now.
Just because the ports are not upgraded yet doesn't mean they won't be in 20 years, if the ships are here the ports will be here as well, This same redundant argument was made for the Airbus plane and the Airports. 

You just don't get it.  

Nicaragua is not Swiss alps. There is no greed or talks of excess here. Its a question about making something which has long term value. Making a factory is for medium term future, making Roads and rails are long term assets, making ports are long term assets, making a Dam, a power plant are long term assets. making a Canal is a long term assets.  

My original comment has all there is to this debate and you clearly don't get it.  

Nicaragua is the 2nd poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, its barely above Haiti on almost every metric. 

If a canal was fine for Panama its fine for Nicaragua. Do you know how many people died making the Panama Canal?  

You said you just found this out, I've known this for 2 years, even when talks/proposals were ongoing. This shows your lack of grip on this issues and this is the majority default setting, no one gives 2 hoots about Nicaragua but suddenly just as it has a chance to make a life for itself, such clueless people are all in arms about things which don't apply in the same way to a country which is not at a stage where those things should be applied.  

Nicaragua is not a hot bed for Next gen tech, its not going to leap frog the world by changing to alternatives, it will go through the usual development cycle, whether you like it or no. At least it will do so in a time where its not as fucked up as Panama was when it had to. The technology available at the time wasn't enough to make Nicaragua possible, it is now so its happening. They are at a better chance of surviving and having a future for their kids and families and escape perpetual poverty today than would have been possible 100 years ago, though even then, after all the mess and carnage Nicaragua would still have benefited with a Canal like Panama did.",,cp2rsbr,False,0,False,1427551941,t1_cp251nb,1,China,,t1_cp2rsbr,1425372468,t5_2qh2v,,0

0,lBigBrother,1,False,t3_2xqukd,"the roach warren goes down immediately after the third. i should have put those both as one point. I want to try my best to give enough information without going crazy on details. if youre not doing part of the build, make units or static defence, or drone, depending on what you see. something as important as drones i should mention around key points. like you say, the roach warren is an important time, so i should say that you should have 16 in main, and between 18-24 depending how hard you went on defence (the queen and spine) 

i really should tell times to send in the ovie if you can, and add another part for saying what to do depending on what you see, or at least what to do if you decide to go down a path. depending on what you see, you might not even want that 5th queen or spine, or you'll want the spine in the main, and 3 queens in the natural defending the mineral line. the reason i dont do the roach/bane version very often, is most of the time terran wont lose enough, and like you say, terran can sit on one base and be content. as a result of this, i havent thought enough to add a third gas, because it doesnt work very well already. 

the idea vs allins is you crush the slow army of terran, by chasing it with lings, then re-applying pressure to the terran. without the lings, you cant kill the bunker being repaired, but once you bust that front bunker, everything behind dies a lot easier. if youre not dedicating to banelings behind this, you still get pretty fast mutas, and youre free to drone for a while, so you'll often have a third fully saturated with a 4th on the way before the terran moves out again. if things dont go well, terran cant catch your roaches very well, so you can run home and conserve them. They're pretty good in ling/bane/muta in the mid game to the point that i've conserved enough, gotten roach speed for them, then had then until i teched to hive, maxed, and needed to bleed them off. 

I haven't played enough to perfect it, and i'm also not good enough to perfect it on my own. I also wouldn't post this build unless i truly thought it was great.  As far as zerg goes, the build itself is super powerful, while also being insanely easy to pull off.

0,mentalmobius,2,1425374715,t3_2xrroc,"Here are the pertinent higlights, bolded by myself:

&gt;S: **Do you include democracy among the European legacy that should be preserved?**

&gt;Ž: It depends on what we mean by this much-abused term — here I am a Leninist: it is always the question of a “concrete analysis of concrete circumstances.” I think that TISA and other agreements are perfect indicators of where we stand with regard to democracy. The key decisions concerning our economy are negotiated and enforced in secrecy, out of our sight, with no public debate, and they set the coordinates for the unencumbered rule of capital. In this way, the space for decisions of the democratically elected political agents is severely limited, and the political process deals predominantly with issues towards which capital is indifferent (like cultural wars).

&gt;S: **But most of us living in liberal democracies still understand ourselves as free citizens …**

&gt;Ž: Here, again, one should repeat Lenin’s ominous question:** “Freedom for whom? To do what?”** Since, in our society, free choice is elevated into a supreme value, social control and domination can no longer *appear* as infringing on a subject’s freedom — **it has to appear as (and be sustained by) the very self-experience of individuals as free.** There is a multitude of forms of this un-freedom appearing in the guise of its opposite: when we are deprived of universal healthcare, we are told that we are given a new freedom of choice (to choose our healthcare provider); when we no longer can rely on a long-term employment and are compelled to search for a new precarious work every couple of years, we are told that we are given the opportunity to reinvent ourselves and discover new unexpected creative potential that lurked in our personality; when we have to pay for the education of our children, we are told that we become “entrepreneurs of the self,” acting like a capitalist who has to choose freely how he will invest the resources he possesses (or borrows). Constantly bombarded by imposed “free choices,” forced to make decisions for which we are not properly qualified (or don’t possess enough information about), **we more and more experience our freedom as what it effectively is: a burden that deprives us of true choice.**

&gt;S: **The conflict between Russia and Ukraine lately gave rise to the specter of World War III — do you take this fear seriously?**

&gt;Ž: Yes, unfortunately. The present situation bears an uncanny resemblance to the situation around 1900 when the hegemony of the British empire was questioned by new rising powers, especially Germany, which wanted their piece of the colonial cake, and the Balkans was one of the places of their confrontation. Today, the role of the British empire is played by the US, the new rising superpowers are Russia and China, and our Balkans is the Middle East. It is the same old battle for geopolitical influence.

&gt;There is another unexpected parallel with the situation before the outbreak of the WWI: **in the last months, media continuously warn us about the threat of the World War III**. Titles like “The Russian Air Force’s Super Weapon: Beware the PAK-FA Stealth Fighter” or “Russia Is Ready for Shooting War, Will Likely Win Looming Nuclear Showdown with U.S.” abound; at least once a week Putin makes a statement seen as a provocation to the West, and a notable Western statesman or NATO figure warns against Russian imperialist ambitions; Russia expresses concerns about being contained by NATO, while Russia’s neighbors fear Russian invasion; etc. **The very worried tone of these warnings seems to heighten the tension** — exactly as in the decades before 1914. And in both cases, **the same superstitious mechanism is at work: as if talking about it will prevent it from happening. We know about the danger, but we don’t believe it can really happen — and that’s why it can happen. That is to say, even if we don’t really believe it can happen, we are all getting ready for it …**

&gt;What further complicates matters is that the competing new and old superpowers are joined by a third factor, the radicalized fundamentalist movements in the Third World which oppose all of them, but are prone to make strategic pacts with some of them. No wonder our predicament is getting more and more obscure: who is who in the ongoing conflicts? How to choose between Assad and ISIS in Syria? Between ISIS and Iran? Such obscurity — not to mention the rise of drones and other arms that promise a clean high-tech war without casualties (on our side) — gives a boost to military spending and makes the prospect of war more appealing.

&gt;S: **How to stop our slide into this vortex?**

&gt;Ž: **The first step is to leave behind all the pseudo-rational talk about “strategic risks” that we have to assume, as well as the notion of historical time as the linear process of evolution where, at each moment, we have to choose between different options of action. We have to accept the threat as our fate: it is not just a question of avoiding risks and making the right choices within the global situation, the true threat resides in the situation in its entirety, in our “fate” — if we continue to “roll on” the way we do now, we are doomed, no matter how carefully we proceed.** So the solution is not to be very careful and avoid risky acts — in acting like this, we fully participate in the logic that leads to catastrophe. **The solution is to fully become aware of the explosive set of interconnections that makes the entire situation dangerous.** Once we do this, we should embark on the long and difficult work of changing the coordinates of the entire situation. Nothing less will do.

Of the 6,000 or so laws in the Single Market acquis, potentially 80 percent are of international origin**. *The rest of the acquis also has international input, which means that a substantial proportion of the so-called ""EU laws"" would remain in force even if we left the EU.*

&gt;In certain countries illegal importing, exporting, sale, or possession of drugs constitute capital offences that may result in the death penalty. According to a 2011 article by the [Lawyers Collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyers_Collective), an [NGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization) in [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), ""32 countries impose [capital punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment) for offences involving narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.""  A 2012 report by [Harm Reduction International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_Reduction_International) ""documents the 33 countries and territories that retain death penalty for drug offences, including 13 in which [the sentence is mandatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_death_sentence).""

Here he serves as the General Secretary of the European Council for Fatwa and Research.

The ECFR is headed by the extremist religious fascist Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, who, among many other disgusting beliefs, supports suicide bombing of civilians, explicitly rejects separation of state and church and freedom of religion, and supports death for atheists and homosexuals. He is banned from entering the US because of his support for violence and terror. The Tory party has called for him to be banned from the UK. 

They say the Halawas were on holiday visiting relatives but what they never show you is the video of them addressing the Muslim Brotherhood supporters in Cairo:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cn09s-Fq5s  
Here is [a translation](http://markhumphrys.com/halawa.html#translation).
Read what he and his sisters were saying to a crowd of Muslim Brotherhood supporters while ""on holiday"".  
Are they the kinds of speeches you give when you go on holiday?
  

Ibrahim Halawa holds both an Irish an Egyptian passport. Reports say he entered on his Egyptian passport. Now that the shit went down, he claims Irish citizenship. He was not born in Ireland. Calling him an Irish teenager is tenuous. An ""Irish passport holder"" would be more accurate.

Also, I find it humorous that you believe making legal guns harder to get would somehow prevent a school shooter. If anything, ""no gun zones"" and restrictive gun laws makes you more vulnerable and completely helpless once that inevitable madman shoots you with an illegally aquired gun. Did you know that Czech people can carry guns to schools and hospitals, only having to leave them when they enter justice dept. buildings, and that they have a very low homicide and crime rate and have had no school shootings in the modern era?

You don't base your opinions on mathematics, nobody does. You've only used mathematics to prove the metrics you like the most.

International rankings can be just as biased as any other rankings. Just pick the ""right"" metrics and you can prove anything, including the ""superiority"" of universal healthcare.

Now that's a great example of cherrypicking your metrics to support your claims. The WHO, UN, CIA, OECD-conducted comparisons all use heavily biased metrics that favor universal healthcare. Instead of only measuring quality of care and availability of it, they measure a ton of metrics that are unique to systems with universal healthcare and of course based on a socialist world view.

We don't use the same currency (it plays a big part in calculating and comparing expenditures) and Finland has 1/30th the population of the US. That's where your argument falls flat, much to your chagrin. This is completely ignoring the fact that the US has the best doctors, the best equipped hospitals and the best medical research.

Well here we go. Um... I guess i'll start from the top. :). I'm going into this assuming that these polls are 100% true and not biased at all.

&gt;Pew Research (2013):
Only 57% of Muslims worldwide disapprove of al-Qaeda.
Only 51% disapprove of the Taliban.
13% support both groups and 1 in 4 refuse to say.

Ok. Looking at the source it's apparent that these polls were taken from a variety of Muslim countries. From Nigeria to Turkey to Pakistan. You can also see that socio-economic and political factors are making a big effect here. In Turkey and Lebanon which are the more developed countries among the pool of countries have a disapproval of 73% and 96% respectfully. The highest approval, not surprisingly, is in Palestine with 35%. In less developed countries such as Pakistan due to propagation by misguided Imams and sketchy street ruling (source: am Paki) religious teaching is very misguided and corrupt. We can see why they'd be lower among the pool with a stance of unfavorable of 46%. Keeping that in mind, as we know of the recent school massacre in Pakistan this position is very much different now. Not surprising that uneducated people make uneducated stances. This problem has less to due with religion and more to due with illiteracy and politics. Also the people who say Muslims are peaceful and would like to be your friend are largely those from more developed countries such as Canada, USA, U.K e.t.c. Denial of such claims through data that merely illuminates the illiteracy within many developing countries is very simple-minded.

&gt;Wenzel Strategies (2012):
58% of Muslim-Americans believe criticism of Islam or Muhammad is not protected free speech under the First Amendment.
45% believe mockers of Islam should face criminal charges (38% said they should not).
12% of Muslim-Americans believe blaspheming Islam should be punishable by death.
43% of Muslim-Americans believe people of other faiths have no right to evangelize Muslims.
32% of Muslims in America believe that Sharia should be the supreme law of the land

First and foremost its not really surprising that Muslims would want Shariah law. They *are* Muslims. I suppose some here want it just merely because they can, because on the flip side it's utterly unnecessary and simplistic to want for such in America as a fellow Muslim. This doesn't really indicate much. What your seeing here is the common Muslim being really sensitive. If this data is to point out that Muslims these days might be a bit too sensitive then I definitively agree. Also, keep in mind that most Muslims are 1st generation immigrants who still think they live in a Muslim dominated environment. Frankly I don't care if these guys think this stuff but I would be very disgraced and offended if they had the audacity to actually try to implement these thoughts. Here we find the interesting aspect of those Muslims who may be educated about Math or Engineering but aren't to familiar with their faith and due to this make unwarranted claims. Keeping that in mind I also wanted to point out that at some of the Mosques I go to a few of the older people and younger people are really blind and disrespectful to others opinions.

&gt;ICM Poll:
40% of British Muslims want Sharia in the UK
20% of British Muslims sympathize with 7/7 bombers
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510866/Poll-reveals-40pc-of-Muslims-want-sharia-law-in-UK.html

Similar to what I wrote above. Though these sympathizers are pretty pathetic. It also says that 1 percent actually thought that the 7/7 bombers were right. Anyone can sympathize with anything though it seems that this is largely to due simple-mindedness.

&gt;Pew Research (2010):
82% of Egyptian Muslims favor stoning adulterers
70% of Jordanian Muslims favor stoning adulterers
42% of Indonesian Muslims favor stoning adulterers
82% of Pakistanis favor stoning adulterers
56% of Nigerian Muslims favor stoning adulterers

Ahhh. So a lot of illiteracy causes illiterate claims. Not surprising. Though what's interesting to note is that even in more developed countries religious simple-mindedness is not always avoided. Religious intolerance can be dealt with in two ways. Through the education of those who aren't familiar with their religion and with other cultures/faiths/peoples or with the annihilation of religion. 

&gt;WZB Berlin Social Science Center:
65%% of Muslims in Europe say Sharia is more important than the law of the country they live in.

Ok. If they want that then whatever. It won't happen though.

&gt;Pew Global (2006)
68% of Palestinian Muslims say suicide attacks against civilians in defense of Islam are justified.
43% of Nigerian Muslims say suicide attacks against civilians in defense of Islam are justified.
38% of Lebanese Muslims say suicide attacks against civilians in defense of Islam are justified.
15% of Egyptian Muslims say suicide attacks against civilians in defense of Islam are justified.

I gotta tell you that as a Muslims and as a Paki I've seen a lot of bad stuff said against anyone who's not Muslim in backward areas. People really like to create this us (muslims) versus them (da west) climate. Killing civilians is justified? I haven't heard that one before.  Also that poll was 9 years ago. In Palestine I can imagine that people are really upset. Anyone can make claims. You shouldn't be concerned with weather or not those claims are dominant but rather if those claims hold truth in them. Also note that this is being said by laymen. If you want a more scholarly opinion look [here](http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/international-relations-and-jihad/jihad-rulings-and-regulations/169768.html?Regulations=). Also note that they worded this very strangely. By making the very question into a us versus them scenario. In the defense of *Islam*? Like Islam is some sort of entity all of the sudden. 

&gt;World Public Opinion (2009)
61% of Egyptians approve of attacks on Americans
32% of Indonesians approve of attacks on Americans
41% of Pakistanis approve of attacks on Americans
38% of Moroccans approve of attacks on Americans
62% of Jordanians approve of some or most groups that attack Americans (21% oppose)
42% of Turks approve of some or most groups that attack Americans (45% oppose)

You know. That's pretty bad but America hasn't really made itself the most beautiful country in the eyes of the average Arab. In Islam because of this sense of Unity people in Pakistan feel affected by events that may be occurring in the mid-east. This plus the anti-America propaganda, shared sentiment and illiteracy can cause these poll results to be pretty understandable. Of all countries I think that America is the most hated in the eyes of general laymen Muslims.

The rest seem to be repetitions of common simple-mindedness. Maybe someone else could tell me how credible these sources are. There's not any surprising poll in here. We now realize that there are a lot of misguided Muslims. Great. Now we can finally move on. His argument seems to be that, no, a minority of Muslims don't hold favorable views. But the people who make these claims (claims that Muslims preach peacefulness) aren't referring to laymen Muslims. They're referring to educated scholars and shaykhs. Sure the laymen that you hate are, in the end, Muslims. But, if you want to understand Muslims, if you wanted to know what Islam is all about then no one would rightfully guide you towards a layman. People who deviate without justification to different position within Islam are known as the deluded. If these are the people you want to know as Muslims then you may just be deluded as well. There are certain things that define one to be a Muslim. Anyone can claim to be Muslim but if you want to know what Muslims are really like, its better for you to ask those Muslims you know of and of the known educated Muslim scholar. Ultimately, we don't know whom are true Muslims in their heart. So the best bet for us to understand Muslims is to go with the ones that adhere to their teaching in the most profound and understandable manner.

Except that the Jews did not force the 750,000 Arabs out. The majority fled either on their own it of fear the Jews might do something (thanks mostly to Arab  propaganda), or due to assurances from their leaders that they should leave so that they can return later and get all the Jewish land (basically what happened with Jerusalem and the Gush Etzion region). There were plenty of Arabs who stayed and did not get involved, and they got Israeli citizenship. 

Now even if you had been correct,  how is it reasonable that something happening in Israel should lead to the forced expulsion and confiscation of goods of nearly a million people in Morocco, Tunisia, Yemen, etc... (especially to nearly 20% more people) who had nothing to do with it. 

&gt;Good old Lord Balfour, promising land in the middle east he had never visited to a bunch of Jews who had never even seen the land so that he wouldnt have to let them move to the UK.  It never surprises me how supportive the most ardent Zionists were of keeping Jews out of their countries and dumping them on the Arabs.  

You clearly know very little about the situation if you actually believe that.

The battles are pretty neat. They are on a MASSIVE scale (tens of millions of combatants, massive space fleets, igniting a gas giant (yes I mean a planet) with nuclear weapons to destroy a fleet ,etc)  while oodles of political intrigue goes on behind the scenes. There are religious/political fanatics, revolutionaries, major economic players, murder plots, coups, corruption, personal vendettas, and all that good stuff.

There are also plenty **[little moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yauioxzb0fw)** that help make the massive cast of characters all memorable and feel more like people than just props in a battle.

Also, due to counter-counter-counter-counter-counter-counter technologies, the show manages to find an excuse that you're totally okay with to explain why the elite infantry boarding parties in this series **[fight each other with battle axes and crossbows in space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1VttN9sWpI)**.

Then why aren't Spain and Portugal openly helping the Greek ""revolt""? They have far more in common with Greece than any of the creditor countries and they would too benefit if a precedent was established of giving Greece more space.

Come on, let's pretend to not see the blindingly obvious. Before Tsipras made his ""controversial statement about the axis of Spain and Portugal"" everyone accepted as obvious that these countries would be reluctant to help Greece because they are entrenched in their austerity rhetoric and their supposed success stories. Only after Tsipras publicly stated what everyone was already saying did this turn into some sort of unthinkable conspiracy theory. Funny how that works, right?

Maybe it's because you're American and over there pretty much everything had to be made from scratch atop of the population growth that this is so impressive to you, but I've lived in several European countries of Christian majority, and I have a hard time recalling any church newer than 50 years old.

It's not surprising that they didn't need new churches in Turkey given the low Christian population and the number existing ones.

Compare Turkey with France (where I live now):

**Turkey**: 160,000 Christians, 349 active churches = **1 per 458 Christians**

**France**: 27,000,000 Christians, 45,000 churches (probably fewer active) = **1 church per 600 Christians**

It seems that French actually discriminate against Christians rather than the Turks.
