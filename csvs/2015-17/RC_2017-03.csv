,t3_5wqina,41,0,Aine_,1488327373,1488339762,WritingPrompts,0,,False,"I received my list on my 18th birthday, just as others had before me and others will after me. Each list contained the pains each person would endure and when. Deaths of loved ones, ruptures in relationships, misfortunes, and other emotional and interpersonal trials and sorrows were laid out before you, handed to you when you came of age by the Monks of the Order of Tempus Loquendi. You don't have to accept your list. You can go on blissfully living your life, taking each day as it comes. But I was too curious, and so I went alone, up to the dreary stone monastery on the Black Mountain, and stood before three monks, a scribe and two guardians, who would hand me the timeline of my sorrows. After what felt like an eternity, the scribe in the middle, seated between two monks whose dark brown hoods obscured their faces, announced he was finished. I took the piece of parchment from his hands, feeling the weight of my future in its thickness.  
  
Under the heading entitled “Sorrows and Tribulations of Adam Jolivet” I found nothing after your 21st birthday. My eyes widened and scanned the page fervently. Usually when someone was to die early, it was listed so that they could live out the rest of their short life doing things they loved or spending time with family. However, this was different. I looked up and stared at the hooded figures manning the printing press and sputtered that there must have been some mistake. Eerie silence was all that followed until the awkward and tense space between us was broken by one telling me that the monks make no mistakes. I swallowed and then asked what it could mean if I have no pain or distress past your 21st year, but I was greeted with silence.

My parents offered me no answers. They seemed just as nonplussed as I was, and my mother quietly suggested that perhaps I should just enjoy these few years I have until I reach 21. My father seemed quiet and tense, tried to argue that if I were going to die the monks would have printed it, but he soon conceded that perhaps I should delay university until it is clear what this means. He shook his head, and I hated the pity in his eyes when he looked at me. My mother took the list from my hands and read it aloud for the umpteenth time.

  
“Sorrows and Tribulations of Adam Jolivet”
* Death of family dog at age 18 years, 7 months, and 7 days  
* Relationship with girlfriend ends at age 18 years, 10 months, 21 days  
* Grandmother dies at age 19 years, 4 months, 19 days  
* Motorcycle accident at age 21 years, 10 months, 1 day    
* No further incidents.    
   
She sighed after reading it, and folded it neatly along the middle before leaving the room to place it in the safe with our family’s other important documents. I felt my mouth twitch as I saw my dog slowly padding behind her and realized how he had started to slow down lately. His 12 years really were beginning to show. I followed my mother and picked him up gently, realizing I only had 7 months left with him, my best friend. In a way, I was grateful for the list for making me appreciate him more, and I thought about the good times we’d had together as I rubbed my face on his soft fur.  
  
After that night, life returned to normal, somewhat. I decided I did still want to go to school, and at my parents’ insistence, I enrolled at the local community college so that I would be close to home should something happen. My parents were keen on traveling, and I admit they were a bit overbearing; however, wouldn’t you also be if you thought your son was going to die?  
  
I was grateful for the extra love, though, when my girlfriend Anna broke up with me. I made the mistake of telling her in our 9th month of dating about the strange end of my list. She promptly told me that hers told her that she would live to see 75, and she didn’t want to spend her life mourning me. I remember the corner of my mouth jerking a bit as my eyes began to burn. I tried to tell her that the list hadn’t told me I would die, but she didn’t want to hear it. She asked me what else my list ending at the age of 21 could mean, and I didn’t have an answer for her. She kissed me on the cheek and left me absorbed in my own thoughts.  
   
I think it was telling my parents what happened that infected them with the travel bug. Anna’s comment bothered them more than it did me, I think, and they wanted to make sure their only child saw as much of the world as he could before he died. We traveled through Europe that summer, seeing the churches of Rome, traveling across the moors of Scotland, wine tasting in Paris, and on and on, until we received the call about my grandmother while in Croatia. We were and were not prepared. Prepared in a general way, yes, because of the list I had received.    
  
My grandmother knew by her own list when her time was coming, as well. However, in the days of traveling, we had lost track of things, and we had forgotten about her imminent passing when we extended our trip the week before. My mother was inconsolable, but not for her mother-in-law. When my dad attempted to comfort her, I heard her sputter something that sounded like “only one more,” before my father hugged her and looked at me sadly. I had grown to hate that look.  
  
After my grandmother’s funeral, my mom was loathe to let me out of the house. I promised her that I wouldn’t ride or go near motorcycles, but that did nothing to help her fears. It was all she could do not to burst into tears every time I left the house, even with my father gently reminding her that the lists were never wrong and that we could only enjoy the time we were given. I always made sure to put on my bravest face for her. As my 21st birthday came and passed, however, even my dad was growing somewhat clingy. I couldn’t blame either of them; they truly thought they were going to lose their only child. Yet, I still couldn’t shake the feeling that the end of the list didn’t mean death for me. Every list I’d seen had said death and what caused it. I took this to mean that the motorcycle accident in my future would mainly cause emotional pain, not physical, even if it was vague.  
   
And just like that, it happened. While out grocery shopping with my mom, I was struck by a jackass on a Harley while in the parking lot of our small town’s only grocery store. The physical pain I felt was nothing compared to the emotional distress I felt at hearing my mother’s anguished scream. That sound and her pale and terrified face were the last things I saw before the black spots filled my vision.  
  
I came to who knows how many hours or days later. I was in a hospital bed with multiple IV’s sticking out of my arms, and, as I slowly began to move my fingers, I realized my right wrist was in a cast. I brought my hand up and felt the bandages wrapped tightly around my head, feeling my face to try to survey the damage. The area around my left eye was swollen and painful, but otherwise my face seemed alright. I tried to move my legs and felt a sharp pain shoot up both. They were in casts, I realized quickly, and I stopped my exploration there. I looked to my left and saw my parents, both asleep and slumped in uncomfortable-looking hospital chairs. My mother’s dark hair had fallen over her face a bit, and my father’s remained in a tense frown even while unconscious. I realized after a few minutes of studying them that…I felt nothing. No love, no concern, no comfort at them being there, just blankness. My mother stirred then, some instinct probably telling her that I was awake and staring at them. She smiled in relief upon waking and seeing my eyes open, and I forced myself to smile at her.  
  
A future with no pain lay before me, I realize now. I suffered a brain injury in the motorcycle crash, I was told, but I didn’t tell the doctors about this startling symptom. And so, I have been given future with no sorrow, no tribulations, and no pain. But that also means a future with no joy, no happiness, and no love either.

&gt;Sexualbrott är en brottstyp där det är relativt vanligt med upprepad utsatthet. Drygt en tredjedel (35 %) utsattes för två till nio händelser under 2015. Drygt en tiondel (12 %) utsattes för tio eller fler händelser. Av alla som utsatts för sexualbrott har alltså sammanlagt 47 procent utsatts minst två gånger under 2015. Antalet händelser uppgår uppskattningsvis till ungefär 482 000, vilket är avsevärt fler än något annat år. Dock har antalet händelser varierat kraftigt över tid, vilket visar att de årsvisa resultaten ska tolkas med försiktighet. 

This section from your link explains that sexual crimes are often repeated between the same offender and victim. 

Sweden count every single time a crime is repeated in the statistics unlike some other countries where a man raping his wife 100 times might count as one criminal act. This is often mentioned when explaining why people like to call Sweden the rape capital of Europe. 

Furthermore it says that a third of the victims in 2015 were victims 2-9 times and 10% were victims more than 10 times, with the same offender. I think it's pretty clear that these type of victims are couples with one abusive partner. 

Lastly, the paragraph explains that 2015 saw a big increase in the number of sexual crimes but this statistic should interpreted carefully. It goes without saying, if a husband rape his partner 1000 times and was convicted in 2015 that's a dent in the statistics that doesn't mean there are more rapists out there.",t5_2qofe,1489224170,t3_5wrds4,flag landskap-uppland,decg8wi,

Here's my take on it:

""Carnival of Light"" is probably already under copyright because they *did* broadcast it once back in 1967 (at a party, and party-goers had to buy tickets in order to attend).

But...all the White Album demos not released on *Anthology 3* have definitely *not* been released officially in any form, so they are *definitely* going to lose their copyright in the EU at the end of 2018 unless they get an official release.

And the year after that is an even bigger deal. Virtually *all* the material from the 1969 Let It Be rehearsals will lose its copyright at the end of 2019. And that's *all* been bootlegged in pristine quality.

So, my gut tells me they're either going to do a few ""Deluxe Album"" releases--perhaps a 2017 deluxe *Sgt. Pepper* followed by a 2018 *The White Album* and 2019 *Let It Be* along with the movie on Blu-Ray. 

Or, they're going to kill all those birds with one stone and have some kind of *Anthology* re-release on Blu-Ray with new bonus tracks.

Whatever the case, if they haven't released ""Carnival of Light"" or the White Album demos officially by the end of 2018, then I don't think we're ever going to hear any of that stuff on an official release, at least not until after both Paul and Ringo are dead.

They've had a good track record lately, so I am hopeful. I think Apple Corps is realizing that whatever they don't monetize now is just going to end up in the British National Archives or another museum, and it will all eventually get released for free once it inevitably becomes part of the public domain.

&gt; Other global evidence of similar large-scale permafrost changes have recently been documented in Siberia, where scientists with the Permafrost Laboratory at the University of Sussex are monitoring another rapidly growing scar in the earth.

&gt; University of Alberta scientists Suzanne Tank, who was not involved in the new study, said that the release of sediments from the new slumps in the Canadian permafrost has significant ecological implications.

&gt; Using satellite images from the European Space Agency&amp;#039;s Copernicus program, the Austrian researchers have shown how, similar to the findings in Canada, thawing permafrost has unleashed huge amounts of sediments below receding glaciers.

HE’s a player that supporters “pay money to go and watch”, but Sydney FC’s hopes of keeping playmaker Milos Ninkovic beyond this season remain in the balance.

Sky Blues boss Graham Arnold said the club would not know until the end of the season whether a contract pitch centred on living and working in Sydney would hold sway over multimillion-dollar offers from the Middle East, and persuade the former Serbian international to re-sign with Sydney.

Exceptional all year in Sydney’s charge towards the Premier’s Plate, Ninkovic has deflected all queries about his future — certain to be fielding offers at least equal to the US$800,000-a-year contract Qatari side Al Gharafa tabled before the start of this season, a deal to which Sydney refused to agree.

Ahead of Friday night’s clash with Melbourne Victory, that could carry Sydney to the brink of winning the minor premiership, Arnold said that Ninkovic was one of the finest players the A-League had seen, and acknowledged that his eight goals and 10 assists this season make him a hot property.

“We’re working hard on his wife and his kids — happy wife, happy life, etc,” Arnold said. “Ninko’s in a good space at the moment and he’s such a fantastic person. He’s enjoying life here in Sydney, he loves the club and sees what we do for him to be able to perform at the level he’s at.

“We’ve had discussions, and they are that he wants to wait until the end of the season. He’s got one thing on his mind and that’s winning, that’s all we’re looking at the moment.

“He’s definitely in the top five (players to have featured in the A-League) — he’s exceptional. He’s a player like Diego Castro at Perth that you’d pay money to go and watch. He does things on the pitch that are top European quality.”",t5_2s6c7,1489225372,t3_5ws25a,sydney,decir57,

The last trading ship in the British fleet had sighted white sails on the horizon, and all on the island now knew that the Empire was coming.

It had been 15 years since King Edward and his family had retreated to the small island of Saint Helena after the disastrous Treaty of London had ceded the last of England's territory on the isles to the Empire.  Evans, always a patriot, had sworn to follow his King to the last, but even he was beginning to waver.  By all reports, they were the last free nation in the world not yet integrated into the Empire.  What use was there in resisting the Emperor's endless armies?

Suddenly, all around Evans there was a flurry of movement as people began to flee into fortress.  A massive building, bristling with defensive points, it was the centerpiece of the island.  Grabbing a passing woman by the wrist, Evans managed to calm her enough to speak.

""What's going on?"" 

""On the horizon!  White sails!  The Empire has come to kill us!""

Evans swore.  They were here too soon, they weren't ready.  Letting the woman flee, Evans ran for his barracks to prepare for the coming battle.

---

The Imperial forces had settled in around the Fortress, their cannon lines had been pounding away at the walls since shortly before they'd arrived.  But the walls were thick, and angled, and the mightiest of the Empire's cannons hadn't so much as dented the walls.  Sergeant Evans gathered with his squad in the courtyard with the other assembled British forces, to hear an address from their King.

King Edward was young, but he'd won the adoration of his men at the battle for the gates of London.  In another life, he'd have been considered a match for the greatest generals of the ages.  But in the time of the Empire, neither Hannibal nor Caesar would have stood a chance.   

At last, the King spoke.

""My friends, my brothers, tonight we stand once more against the Empire of Ryukyu.  Last year they secured the final pockets of independence in Europe, and now they turn to us, once more.""

""Some of you may ask why we do not surrender.  We are but the last vestige of a fallen age.  All others have knelt to the Empire, so why do we stand?  We stand because we hold the hopes of all those the Empire has conquered.  For as long as we stand, the Emperor cannot claim victory.  As we still stand, we hold the fires of hope.  Across the world, the subjects of the Empire bristle at their overlords, dreaming of a free world.  We bear that dream, and it is our duty to keep that dream alive!""

""We will hold this fortress!  In the past fifteen years we have hollowed out vast chambers into the rock beneath this fortress.  We have grain and food plenty for years.  They will launch volley after volley, assault after assault, and we will throw them back.  And once our fire ignites a revolution across their empire, we shall be victorious!""

*3 years later*
---

The Eternal Emperor of the Grand Empire of Ryukyu sat staring utterly unbelieving at the news that had arrived at his desk.

**The siege has not yet broken, your eternal magnificence.  Our greatest seers deem that there is a 95% chance they shall break next month**

Ever since the Emperor had gained his powers, nearly 400 years prior, he had used them to aid his people as well as they could.  Able to alter his perception of time, including the ability to slow it to a perceptible halt, the Emperor had guided his armies with the utmost precision.  Able to transfer his will to his progeny upon his death, his singular vision had remained unchanged.  And finally, in the utmost of emergencies, he could revert the universe itself to what it was but a month hence.

But it had all come at a cost

*By January 21st, 1821, Ryukyu must rule the entire planet either directly or through its subjects.  Do this, or all shall be undone.*

After nearly a hundred resets, with the garrison on their last legs, the siege had failed to end each time.  And the Emperor could feel the source of his power had grown increasingly enraged.  But this was the tipping point.  As time ran out for the 100th time, the Emperor felt the ages roll back over him, and as he opened his eyes, everything was as it had been in November of 1444.

Though neither Edward nor Evans would be born to see it, they had won.

And, just to clarify, I didn't mean that collecting profit is easy. The point to me is the justification for the usual distribution of profits, if it's somehow justified by modern economics or not and, if it is, how they dismiss the marxist theory of exploitation.

What I usually see is that there is not much discussion about the reasons why profits are always appropriated by investors and workers don't have any _right_ to it. Companies sometimes offer shares, but it's left completely to the owners to decide. If mainstream economics doesn't have any justification for that beyond ""market power"", as /u/zzzzz94 suggested, then ok, at least we are being honest here. I'm interested in knowing if there are any topics in microeconomics, for example, that cover these questions or if it's simply considered ""how things are"".

Example: someone works and gathers some money to start a business. Then, he hires people to work in the business for him (including someone to manage it, and he himself remains just the original investor). Considering that he worked for some time to gather the money he invested, it seems fair that, if the business thrives, he receives his investment back plus some part of the profits as compensation. But, assuming that he deserves profits as compensation for his sacrifice to gather money in the first place, why is it that, no matter how long the people he hired work, they will never _deserve_ to receive part of the profits? They should gradually get shares of the business as compensation for their sacrifice, too, just like the original investor (""owner""), even if we discounted their salaries already received (which could be considered part of their profit shares given in advance).

you can absolutely be a nationalist without being a racist, it just depends on the type you are. political nationalism is actually pushed and propagandized for very hard in this country, but the pushers--the govt, the schools, the sports teams, the MSM etc--purposefully refuse to call it what it is. they just treat it as the normal state of being.

the 99% is almost always nationalistic economically, even if they shy away from the word because it has been conflated with racist-based anti-immigration sentiments since the 1880s. 

nationalist economic policy benefits workers and smaller businesses that cannot compete with large ones in terms of global rescource pricing and wages. it hurts large global businesses that rely on selling things made on the cheap abroad for larger profits back home, because it forces them to internalize the externality of their offshoring through tariffs etc.

the history and connotation of nationalism is interwined with populism and immigration in america, and highly propagandized in this motherland of global capitalism that is our country in order to kill it:

1860-1870--the west closes. all the land is now somebodies, if you don't have any, you aren't likely to get any now. unions and workers start making head way in their fights against their employers

1873--the panic of 1873 occurs, causing a global depression that lasts until 1879 (this was the great depression until the 1930s great depression changed it to the long depression).

1880-1890--native workers demand better conditions. a new flood of poor, unskilled europeans show up, filling every job left ""open"" by strikers. native born workers begin to hate them for being scabs. all gains made by workers in the previous decades are lost. 

propaganda extolling america's open borders policy and its open arms policy of welcoming of immigrants begins being seen for the 1st time, capped off with the statute of liberty in 1886.

european nations use america's open border policy  at this time to ""solve"" their over populated, poor people problem.

most immigrants are actively recruited by US steel, glass, and coal companies, who used them to ""solve"" their union, strikes, and ""high"" wages problem.

1893--the panic of 1893 occurs, depression lasts until 1897.

booker t. washington, a black man, pleads for the borders to be closed because cheap white unskilled FOB immigrants are taking the only jobs open to blacks, relegating them to lay about ne'er do wells.

the populist party is founded to take the country back from the robber barron capitalists and close the borders to protect native workers and their power to organize effectively against their employers for better wages, hours, and working conditions. the official name of the populist party is the people's party.

1890-1900--populist party begins having limited success with getting the govt to close the borders. 

the infamous chinese exclusion act gets passed to bar cheap, unskilled chinese immigrants, forever equating anti-immigration and populism with racism. the chinese exclusion act will be used as cudgel against all those calling for restricted imigration in the name of native workers from now on.

1921--the 3% quota immigration act passed limiting european immigration. millions of europeans wanted to immigrate in the aftermath of WW1. the policy has been condemned ever since as being racist and unfair to eastern europeans. 

1924--statute of liberty raised from just NYC statue, to a national monument. as FDR said, ""there are no coincidences in politics.""

1933--populism is rebranded by foes as political nationalism, linking it to the nazis and the facists. in the US, true/classic political nationalism was and is an oxymoron. 

political nationalism began in the late 1800s in europe as a movement by various ethnic/lingual minorities in countries throughout europe, but mostly eastern europe, to get their own countries based on their ethnic idenity. political nationalism is inherently racist and bigotted, by the very minorities demanding it as much as by the ethnic majorities inspiring them.

populists were pro-worker/pro-farmer economic nationalists. they were also fierce advocates for democracry and fierce foes of ploitical/govt corruption. they had absolutely no interest in creating little sub-nations for every ethinic group in the US (which even in the late 1800s included just about every group in the world). 

the facists in the US in the 1930s were literally all east coast WASP blue bloods like prescott bush. that's some powerful propaganda reality shifting right there. even the racist, political/identity nationalistic screeds were almost all written by ivy leaguers and in every case were arguing for the supremacy of the anglo-saxon. the populists and working class were low on anglo-saxon members.

immigration takes a back seat from the 1930s to 1946, then the drum beat for open immigration policy starts peeking up, but from 1945-1970 unions are too strong. even migrant workers under cesar chavez effectively unionize.

1970-1980--the neocon and neoliberal globalists start having greater and greater successes against unions, and a new statue of liberty imigration propaganda push kicks off again right in step with the 3rd way DLC democrat identity politics coup, which killed economics as the issue of the left, and replaced it with bourgeois identity sympathizing.

1980--reagan wins in a landslide (the dems had lost labor to reagan, because blue color workers didn't have the upper middle class luxury of making sure everyone received the dignity and respect they deserved. but joke was on them, reagan fucked them over in the end).

1980-1990--unions are in full retreat, rust belt keeps rusting. amnesty for current undocumented peoples already living here through the immigration act of 1986, which focused a large part on cracking down on those employing undocumented workers. 

the bill was attacked for discriminating against hispanics because potentially employers might refuse to hire any of them for fear they were illegal, so the fear of racism and discrimination was used to try to kill a bill that would help all workers, native and undocumented, by combatting the black labor market directly.

1990-2000--the NAFTA-WTO-GATTS-401k bataan death march of labor. all criticism labeled evil, naive nationalism. ross perot gets 19% on an anti-NAFTA 3rd party bid. is labeled a kook.

2000 to present--H1B visas, perenial talk about ""immigration reform"" that convenietly never does anything to help anyone on anyside, except businesses which employ black market labor.

dem party no longer even remembers the economic populism and nationalistic economics it was founded on. it is only concerned with identity politics now to the most absurd and granular degree. criticising black market labor gets one automatically branded a racist, with no discussion. no nuance is allowed (this worse now since the trump hysteria took hold). t.

he MSM pushes this meme relentlessly, silencing labor on this issue and shaming everyone who does not want to be labeled a racist into silence. unfortuanately, the ones who do speak out tend to be the actual racists, having no shame to silence. this is used as proof that economic nationalism is racist, neo-nazi facism.

you'll notice political/identity based nationalism in the US is never actually denounced. it's encouraged, even mandated--we are one the most flag waving, military cheering, pledge saying, war waging countries in the history of the earth. in fact, identity politicas is just a form of political nationalism writ small, saying that every possible affinity group, no matter how small, deserves its own ""country"" within our country. a house divided and all that be damned. or rather a house divided be easily manipulated.

what isn't allowed is economic nationalism, which is and always has been primarily an issue of economic survival, for both individuals and non-global businesses, and arguing this will get you labeled a racist and a nazi and a facist, by all who are not at least a few streets over from the actual racists etc

 there is no label for political nationalism, because they pretend they are the same thing, and pretend that there is nothing to see when true political nationalism rears its head.

why? because economic nationalism empowers people and cuts into globalist profits, whereas political nationalism makes people proud of their economic oppression,  and unsympathetic to all the other folk beyond their border that their country is fucking up the as twice as hard. 

it's very effective. most dem identity politic disciples don't care about black and brown people outside of the contiguous US. this is true of most bernie supporters as well--look how they went ape shit when it was pointed out that bernie has never opposed war while in congress on an humanitarian basis as pointed out by people like chris hedges and amaju barraka.

that's globalism at work, because globalist economies cannot exist in counties with nationalistic economies.

,t1_dec7shh,70,0,deimodos,1488335239,1488349183,explainlikeimfive,0,,False,"This answer is wrong. We can do this. ABB (the European version of GE and employer of 135,000 people) *is* doing this. Basically run a bunch of solar power panels in North Africa and use them to power Europe. It's called the ""European Grid Vision"" and, like all great death metal music, was conceived in the 1990's.

What changed?

The advent of production ready Hybrid HVDC breakers.

 Backing up, it's a common misconception that DC is less efficient for transmission than AC. At high voltages and currents, DC is more efficient but significantly harder to ""Grid"" - i.e. hookup a bunch of power stations in parallel and failover if one goes offline. 

As a very dumb ELI5 analogy: High Voltage AC is like a speaker at a rock concert. The energy travels pretty far (and fades off) and if you need to turn it off it's a simple switch - or you just stop playing. It's a million angry pixies dancing in a field. Music stops playing, the pixies stop dancing. High Voltage DC power on the other hand is like a freight train - it takes a lot of energy to get it going but once it's going it's trucking, it's not fading off, and it's efficient. The problem is you can't stop it on a dime. Imagine a million angry pixies sliding down one of those super steep water slides fast as they can, except the water slide is as wide as the Colorado River and they're all packed shoulder to shoulder and did I mention? There's a million of them. If the ones in front suddenly want to stop sliding? Well guess what. Not happening.

This ability for DC to not 'stop on a dime' meant you couldn't switch it, which meant you couldn't grid it - unless, well, you built mini-versions of power stations that popped up every couple of blocks in a neighborhood. To use one analogy, it's like throwing a spigot on your home's plumbing. Easy to turn the water on and off when it's 1/2"" pipe - throw a spigot on the Colorado and it's just going to get washed away. To use the other analogy, it's the equivalent of using a bunch of hand trucks to move power around rather than a freight train. The mini-station model was less efficient and meant investors did not choose to build the nation's grid with DC. It's a subtle nuance in the AC/DC efficiency debate - and part of the reason why Edison was so pissed at Tesla - he believed you could grid DC if you could solve the switching problem and scale it up it was the clear winner. Nobody really listened because all he had to show for it was an army of cute hand trucks and a dead Elephant. Nothing compared to Darth Tesla and Emperor Westinghouse and the unbridled firepower of the fully armed and operational Niagara Falls Adams Power Station. But anyways, whatever, that's ancient history. DC is more efficient than AC, it's why we use it to maximize our phone's battery life, and why (if we could figure out how to scale it up) use it to connect grids.

But starting in the late 1960's ABB began making strides in being able to switch high voltage DC. The original breakers were mechanical single stage devices that murdered people. Later we got two stage breakers. Fast forward 60 years they have perfected High Voltage DC switching by using a three stage DC breaker. Again, a very dumb analogy, but the idea is rather than force a freight train to stop on a dime by slamming on the brakes (1 stage breaker), you throw in a steering wheel, kind of it flick one way (1st stage), then quickly turn the other (2nd stage), and full on jack-knife yourself while shifting into second as your engine is banging off the limiter (3rd stage) and you come to a calm collected stop facing the other direction, parallel parked between a Fiat Campagnola and a Porsche 944 staked out front of the Olive Garden. If you're running booze illegally this is called a bootlegger's turn. If you're running a gigawatt of energy it's called a VSC-HVDC Netzentwicklungsplan and it takes 10ms.

That ABB figured out how to switch HVDC shouldn't have happened. (This was a couple of years ago in 2012 with some whispers in 2006) ABB gets such an epic scoop on GE, announces the Hybrid HVDC is production ready (something GE experts thought wouldn't wouldn't happen until 2030) and we are still reeling from the implications. Suddenly the unit economics of 100 year old grid have a whole new floor on long distance transmission cost. It's like ABB is Burt Reynolds and just perfected the handbrake turn in his 5.0L Trans Am while simultaneously lashed to Snowball in his eighteen wheeler and 352 eighteen wheelers behind it and GE is just standing there like Buford T. Justice gawfawing and jumping on his hat.

We can use solar from North Africa, wind farms in the Baltic, geo-thermal in Iceland to power the entire continent. The prevalence of large bodies of water makes 'right of way' pretty simple - you essentially couple the local AC grids to high voltage DC lines running under the Mediterranean or the Black or the North Seas. You can dam and fill up fjords using solar power connected during the day, and drain them to generate hydro at night. The idea that one alternative energy is going to win out suddenly doesn't need to be true for the technology to scale.

When we grid these grids we call them Supergrids. (Kind of like how we call a network of networks an internetwork or internet for short.)

The advent of supergrids means nations can trade on energy like brokers trade on stocks. That it simultaneously smooths demands, guarantees new income, and lets Europe backoff from their current largest supplier of energy and aggressor (Russia) guarantees it will be funded.

They also had other tribal groups like the Turks who would become Turkish and the Magyars who became Hungarians. The whole race mixing thing is funny when a made up imaginary spook  invented bigotry when it was formless so it didn't have a color and wasn't even a human being at all.

Well, you want to draw lines so let's draw them were they really matter at the start of season 5. The current dynamic of the game totally relies on keystone so let's look at season 5 and season 6.

At MSI 2015 FNC hashad the best Bo series that the whole west ever had against korea and even against SKT, they gave them a close series losing 3-2.

EU made it out of groups in season 5 while NA didn't and were able to beat EDG and Flash Wolves. Also Flash wolves and AHQ won when it mattered while C9 and CLG didn't.

Pretty much since MSI 2016 EU slumps pretty hard, CLG took second at that time and yet it wasn't even close to the performance of FNC 2015 with beating FW in semis but getting totally destroyed against SKT.

2016 worlds both regions looked weak with TSM being the strongest team in the tournament and yet they failed to perform again and got totally shut down by the still from their slump recovering chinese region.

So since the instruction of keystones, EU had pretty much the higher heights and the lower lows.

EU won't be a strong region as long as something like G2 is first place there and yet, that doesn't make NA a strong region.

NA is known for failing when it acutally matters and they never gave korea a hard series like EU did in 2015, (which was also way above NAs performance in 2014 even if we would include it, also 2016 TSM can easily be compared to 2014 Alliance) NAs best showing was CLG at MSI and they looked really weak compared to FNCs showing a year before that.",t5_2rfxx,1489227804,t3_5wdbue,team nox,decnszo,

I did not take the time to overthink everything so there may be some minor inaccuracies or things that may seem far fetched, but this is just for fun so what the hell. To summarize, after the battle of the Plains of Abraham, it is a little known fact that the French troops actually managed to regroup somewhere south of Quebec City. They would have had enough manpower and equipment to stand a reasonable change of taking back the city. However they chose not too for some reason I can’t recall. In this timeline, the troops did in fact retake Quebec City. France managed to negotiate a better capitulation treaty, therefore surrendering much of their North American holdings such as Louisiana, the Great Lakes region and much of the Midwest, but keeping what was then known as Canada (Quebec and Ontario) as well as Acadia. The French and Indian War lasted a few months more than it did in real life and was still a massive defeat for the Kingdom of France. Because of this, the French still supported the American Revolution and the French Revolution still happened as well. Due to the influence from the newly formed United-States and the poor administration of New-France by the French government, a Canadian separatist sentiment took foot in the colony. When the French revolution was at its peak in 1794, Canada declared its independence. Due to the turmoil going on in France and the massive support from the United-States, France offered very little resistance to the declaration of independence even though it did not recognize it until years later. Due to the lack of resistance from France, an all-out rebellion never had to happen. A few skirmishes did occur, but they were fairly limited. Canada adopted a Federal presidential constitutional republican system similar to the American one with a few differences. The newly formed Canada ended up being perceived as a land of opportunity for European Catholics, which led a lot of the Irish, Italians and other Catholic populations to choose Canada instead of the United-States as their new home despite the harsh climate due to the prevalent Anti-Catholic sentiment of the United-States. Because of that, the population of Canada ended up being similar to the actual population of that region, but much more concentrated in what is in our timeline known as Quebec and New Brunswick. Ontario remains highly developed, but due to historical reasons, it remained mostly rural.",t5_2vqof,1489228144,t3_5wso9m,,decoi4l,

North Dakota is not a person, it's an organizational concept of 757,952 individual people, and because of winner take all nonsense, the electoral college, and the states own inability to attract citizens to their location verses other states we are now in a situation where they are telling the states that actually generate most of the nation's GDP how that should be spent.

Should the person who earns least in a household set the budget?  Who would suggest yes to this?

If we voted in a national election, everyone's vote would be counted equally, regardless of where they live.  Drawing silly lines around Americans and suggesting somehow those people aren't getting a voice simply because MOST people disagree with them is patently false.

&gt; The Toy Dolls are a British punk rock band. They formed in 1979, playing their first ever gig at Millview Social Club, Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, UK, on 20 October 1979. After a couple of gigs, vocalist Pete Zulu left to form his own band. He was replaced by Paul ""Hud"" Hudson, who himself left after a single gig, leaving Toy Dolls as a trio with guitarist Michael ""Olga"" Algar to assume vocal duties. This was just the start of the revolving door of drummers and bassists that would characterize the Toy Dolls line-up over the years.

&gt; They quickly built up a local fan base and were initially grouped with the Oi! scene that was emerging at the time, although many would say that despite having the singalong choruses that are typical of Oi!, they are better classified as pop punk. Another reason they are associated with Oi! is that they were championed by Garry Bushell who was heavily involved with Oi! bands such as The Angelic Upstarts. In 1980 a local businessman financed their debut single, ""Tommy Kowey's Car"" with ""She Goes to Finos"" on the B-side. The single quickly sold out its initial 500 pressing but the band couldn't afford to press any more, making the single a collector's item.

&gt; In 1983, they released their debut album Dig That Groove Baby, by which time with Bushell's help they were beginning to attract national press attention, and in 1984 they burst into the charts with their punk rendition of ""Nellie the Elephant"", a classic children's song, which reached #4 in the UK charts and stayed in the Top 100 for no less than 12 weeks.

&gt; The Toy Dolls have since changed their lineup and record labels, establishing and cultivating fan bases in Europe, America and Japan, continuing to release new singles and albums.

They hold that white people should maintain their majority in mainly-white countries, maintain their dominance of its political and economic life, and that their culture should be foremost.[4] Many white nationalists believe that miscegenation, multiculturalism, mass immigration of non-whites and low birth rates among whites are threatening the white race,[6] and some argue that it amounts to white genocide.[6] According to white nationalist Samuel T. Francis, it is ""a movement that rejects equality as an ideal and insists on an enduring core of human nature transmitted by heredity.""[11] Jared Taylor, a white nationalist, claims that similar racial views were held by many mainstream American leaders before the 1950s.[11]

According to Samuel P. Huntington, white nationalists argue that the demographic shift in the United States towards non-whites brings a new culture that is intellectually and morally inferior.[10] 

They argue that with this demographic shift comes affirmative action, immigrant ghettos and declining educational standards.[12] Most American white nationalists say immigration should be restricted to people of European ancestry.""",t5_2cneq,1491107296,t3_5wqa2b,,decu7p7,

You are mistaken there. Judaism is both a religious and an ethnic identity. It is an insular religion that generally discourages conversion and cherishes descent from earlier Jews by blood. Secular and Atheist Jews/Israelis still usually consider themselves culturally Jewish - there's a lot to Jewish culture outside religion.

Well we don't share the same view here as in my utopia there would be no homosexuals, or at least there would be but they won't act upon their desires due to my religious background.

&gt; What I do know is that women are oppressed more frequently in Muslim majority countries than in others, and also more frequently in Muslim communities in my country than in the general public.

Of course because where do you find the highest percentage for illiteracy? the muslim world so of course their women would be oppressed. Our governments literally work against the society. Even if the armed colonization is gone, we are still controlled by the west economically, economically speaking, the west need a market to sell its products, if the arab world becomes independent economically who's gonna buy their products? The african market is very important to europe and the US, we are the consumer and they make sure that we always stay like that. 

Do you know that when France colonized Morocco they forced us to have a constitution and not use the sharia ? After they left the government didn't go back to sharia, until today we still use the constitution that was put in place by France, so how can we call morocco a muslim country? If the government doesn't even use the laws put in place in its holy book.

&gt; Can you criticize prophet Muhammad? Can you say that he wasn't a good role model in certain aspects of his life?

It depends on how you're going to criticize him, what i see in the west nowadays is they don't criticize the prophet they directly insult him and accuse him of certain acts. This is not what free speech is imo.

 **comment content**: This probably means two things, one is that American shipping is to some degree left alone by the u-boats and that Germany doesn't attempt to drag Mexico into the war.

The determining factor here is the Russian exit.  It was complete early in 1918, and this freed up a million German troops from the Russian front to come west.  Historically, this was about the time that American troops entered the fight.  None of the combatants on the western front were at the top of their game given 4 years of losses, but a million men is still a million men.  Germany had them (but not a deep pool of replacements by then), and France and Britain did not.

If Germany can make good on their spring 1918 offensive, they win.  It's probably not a crushing victory, but either the French army is functionally exhausted or Paris is taken or both.

The consequences for France, Britain, and Belgium are a loss of colonial territory but probably something close to status quo in Europe.  However, the consequences of the German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman empires existing postwar are significant.  Additionally, this almost certainly means that the USSR is strangled in its cradle and Russia either becomes an elected republic or a constitutional monarchy.

Should the German offensive of 1918 fail, it's almost certain that the Germans will stand on the defensive against a sizable new batch of British tanks in 1919 and lose.  The British had access to American munitions and other industrial imports, and were able to build tanks in significant quantity where Germany could not, and it would have to be industry that established a final leverage where manpower was largely depleted.

,t3_5wkdzc,3,0,0bsidian,1488350133,False,pics,0,,False,"I am a climber and because someone asked for an ELI5 on climbing grades, and in particular why climbing grades are so confusing and are not exactly sequential, I'm going to explain it with regards to its historical context:

Climbing grades exist to give climbers some kind of idea of the route's level of difficulty - you wouldn't want to start climbing something only to find that it's way above your pay grade. We come up with these grades through consensus between multiple people who have climbed the route, but it is still often arbitrary. There are many forms of climbing and many types of grading systems, and it also varies depending on region. In the art of *sport climbing* such as what Margot Hayes has accomplished here, Europeans mostly use the *French* grade system (9a+) while in North America we use the *Yosemite Decimal System* or YDS (5.15a). French 9a+ is equal to YDS 5.15a in difficulty. It's like taking measurements in inches vs. centimetres, the values change depending on the system but the distance does not.

YDS is a really old system that was intended to be used for mountaineering, but was adopted by climbers for a purpose that isn't exactly appropriate and is thus very confusing. YDS starts with a *class* value followed by a *grade* value, separated by a decimal point. In the strictest sense, YDS is a decimal system meaning it is bound by lower and upper values of 0-9, but more on that later.

In mountaineering terms, YDS starts off with a *class* value between 1-5 (historically there is a 6th class for aid climbing, but no one uses it since they have their own grading system and aid climbers are nuts and practically have their own language). Class 1 means flat terrain, class 2 means a slight incline, class 3 is a steep hill, class 4 requires scrambling with your hands and feet, class 5 means rope is considered mandatory or risk of death. As climbers, we are only interested in class 5, because we're climbing not hiking, so everything we climb is class 5.

Following the class value is a difficulty *grade* value, historically ranging between decimal values of 0-9. This tells us how hard the climb is. A 5.0 climb means rope is mandatory for safety, but relatively easy like climbing a ladder. For most climbers 5.0-5.4 is rudimentary and myself have even climbed low grade stuff like this without a rope (called free soloing)! For climbers in the 1950's 5.9 was considered the hardest possible, but they were climbing with hemp ropes wrapped around their waists and climbed with clunky hiking boots. As equipment improved and climbers got stronger, the closed decimal values started to show it limits. Records are meant to be broken, and it wasn't helpful to keep calling all the hard routes 5.9. So like a guitar amp, climbers ""cranked it up to 11"" and broke the decimal part of the YDS by adding a 5.10!

But soon, climbers found even 5.10 limiting but you can't go beyond 10, so they started adding letter grades to differentiate between an easier 5.10a and a harder 5.10b. You started to have in sequence: 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10a, 5.10b, 5.10c, 5.10d. The relative difficulty between a 5.7 to 5.8 is about equal to the relative difficulty between a 5.10a and 5.10b. Once again, we hit limits and you can't keep adding letters to the ends of our grades, so they caved and following 5.10d eventually added a 5.11a, followed by 5.11b, 5.11c, 5.11d, 5.12a, 5.12b, etc. Climbers now have a fully open system without limits, though having achieved this in a confusing roundabout way.

Why not just re-label everything with a system that makes more sense? In a way, some of the other systems like the French system makes more sense, but then you have to rewrite all the guidebooks and who has time to do that when there's climbing to be done? Serious climbers tend to try and do as little work as possible to spend as much time climbing as possible.

Personally, I consider myself an amateur athlete and train at least 3x a week consistently for the last 4+ years, having climbed casually on and off for a total of about 10 years. I have sent (having climbed a route from beginning to end without falling or resting on the rope) routes rated around the 5.12 level, and have projected (worked on the route with lots of falling) up to the 5.13 level.

Climbs get exponentially harder as the grade goes up. 5.10s are popular among normal climbers, the number of people who climb 5.11s starts to taper off sharply between 50-25% of most enthusiasts. I've been told that less than 5% of climbers can climb 5.12 and 5.13 drops down to less than 1%. 5.14 and 5.15 are reserved for the elite professionals, who are often sponsored, many of them making climbing their full time day job. The world's hardest climb has been completed by just two people and given an estimated consensus grade of 5.15c.

Anyway, congrats to Margo Hayes for hitting 5.15a! That photo shows true grit achieved through incredibly hard work, from bloody scraped up fingers to sweaty chalk covered hands and face.",t5_2qh0u,1491108586,t3_5wkdzc,,decwve8,

Oh, we have a lot more to offer Russia then Turkey does.  You might think you can play us off against each other, but in many things Russia and the US are oddly on the same page.  Iranian nuclear proliferation, AQ &amp; ISIS in Syria, continuation of Russian bases in Syria, shared policy on North Korea, Chinese containment in the pacific ocean, coordination of air forces in Syria, and so on.  No reason we cannot add Turkey to the list.

After all, both Russia and the US have bigger fish to fry then Turkey.  Part of the reason Turkey gets away with the shit it does is your just not important enough to be on the radar.  Start killing US troops, and I can assure you Turkey will have our attention.  With our attention, shifts the EU and most of Asia.   It will be imperial power along the lines of yesterday Turkey had an economy, today Turkey cannot feed itself or make its IMF payment.   When Turkey is begging US Aid for the next meal, perhaps we can discuss support for ISIS, AQ, the FSA, and killing US soldiers.

My sweet darling girl
At last you write to me! You must have given that naughty little cunt of yours a most ferocious frigging to write me such a disjointed letter. As for me, darling, I am so played out that you would have to lick me for a good hour before I could get a horn stiff enough even to put into you, to say nothing of blocking you. I have done so much and so often that I am afraid to look to see how that thing I had is after all I have done to myself. Darling, please don’t fuck me too much when I go back. Fuck all you can out of me for the first night or so but make my get myself cured. The fucking must all be done by you, darling, as I am so soft and small now that no girl in Europe except yourself would waste her time trying the job. Fuck me, darling, in as many ways as your lust will suggest. Fuck me dressed in your full outdoor costume with your hat and veil on, your face flushed with the cold and wind and rain and your boots muddy, either straddling across my legs when I am sitting in a chair and riding me up and down with the frills of your drawers showing and my cock sticking up stiff in your cunt or riding me over the back of the sofa. Fuck me naked with your hat and stockings on only flat on the floor with a crimson flower in your hole behind, riding me like a man with your thighs between mine and your rump very fat. Fuck me in your dressing gown (I hope you have that nice one) with nothing on under it, opening it suddenly and showing me your belly and thighs and back and pulling me on top of you on the kitchen table. Fuck me into you arseways, lying on your face on the bed, your hair flying loose naked but with a lovely scented pair of pink drawers opened shamelessly behind and half slipping down over your peeping bum. Fuck me if you can squatting in the closet, with your clothes up, grunting like a young sow doing her dung, and a big fat dirty snaking thing coming slowly out of your backside. Fuck me on the stairs in the dark, like a nursery-maid fucking her soldier, unbuttoning his trousers gently and slipping her hand into his fly and fiddling with his shirt and feeling it getting wet and then pulling it gently up and fiddling with his two bursting balls and at last pulling out boldly the mickey she loves to handle and frigging it for him softly, murmuring into his ear dirty words and dirty stories that other girls told her and dirty things she said, and all the time pissing her drawers with pleasure and letting off soft warm quiet little farts behind until her own girlish cockey is as stiff as his and suddenly sticking him up in her and riding him.
Basta! Basta per Dio!
I have come now and the foolery is over. Now for your questions!
We are not open yet. I send you some posters. We hope to open on the 20th or 21st. Count 14 days from that and 3 1/2 days for the voyage and I am in Trieste.
Get ready. Put some warm-brown-linoleum on the kitchen and hang a pair of red common curtains on the windows at night. Get some kind of a cheap common comfortable armchair for your lazy lover. Do this above all, darling, as I shall not quit the kitchen for a whole week after I arrive, reading, lolling, smoking, and watching you get ready the meals and talking, talking, talking, talking to you. O how supremely happy I shall be! God in heaven, I shall be happy there! I figlioli, il fuoco, una bona mangiata, un caffe nero, un Brasil, il Piccolo della Sera, e Nora, Nora mia, Norina, Noretta, Norella, Noruccia ecc ecc…
Eva and Eileen must sleep together. Get some place for Georgie. I wish Nora and I had two beds for night-work. I am keeping and shall keep my promise. love. Time fly on, fly on quickly! I want to go back to my love, my life, my star, my little strange-eyed Ireland!

&gt; French prosecutors opened an investigation in December 2015 into the graphic series of tweets by National Front leader Le Pen, which included a photo of the decapitated body of US reporter James Foley.

&gt; Le Pen has so far refused to attend a police interview over the investigation by police in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, citing her status as a Member of the European Parliament.

&gt; Foley&amp;#039;s bereaved parents John and Diane said they wanted the images removed immediately, accusing Le Pen in a statement of using the &amp;quot;Shamefully uncensored&amp;quot; image to her own political ends.

If you only go into the source I linked, it says 0.2% because that one number for 18 year old males. And if you look like 18-30 age range, it is still about 5'9''.

It still means ""you blind or racism has fucked your eyes up? Because that's about half of males in Beijing who are apparently invisible to you. You only see what you want to see or what you think it is true.""

---

&gt; I don't think all Asians are short, but to deny that the average height of Asians is lower than the average European, American or African height is plainly denying measurable facts. There are regional variations in height as well, of course, but we're talking averages with the greatest number of the population occupying the center of the curve.

That's absolutely not true though. Look at that average height world link. East Asians are taller than most African countries, for one. And middle eastern countries.

If you only look at younger generations of Asians, thus discounting famine factor, the height of Asians are basically equivalent to European countries of equivalent standards of living.

&gt; Same way the average penis size is greater among Africans and a propensity for obesity is more common among Caucasians, it's genetic variations that don't intrinsically mean anything about a person's worth.

Lmao. You believe that shit too about how African have bigger penis?

It shouldn't, but the racist western society have certainly made these stereotypes a thing that impacts lives. Do I even need to explain?

Japanese armour was made out of inferior steel compared to European or Indian armour (the best steel was usually reserved for blades) if indeed it was made out of steel at all; until the 1500s leather was very commonly substituted for at least a part of the scales.

However, it still provided perfectly adequate protection. Especially the true kozane are very resistant to piercing due in part to the cushioning effect of the lacing. The downsides are that the armour produced in such fashion is comparatively bulkier than steel plate, and cannot be fashioned into articulated assemblies to provide the type of full coverage associated with contemporary European suits of plate. Also, the silk lacing soaks up water like crazy, meaning that if it rains, your armour becomes twice as heavy. This is supposed to have prompted the development of reduced sugake lacing.

&gt;was European blacksmitting and metallurgy that superior that you can simply attack a Samurai armor with modern knives and it will easily pierce the chestplate and hit the adbdomen area of the wearer of Samurai arms?

Abdomen area on a samurai suit of armour is protected basically just by lace (*maybe kikko* underneath), so piercing that is not terribly difficult. The breast of the *do*, not so much.

You do need better steel to be able to draw out large plates without having to worry about them breaking, but the advances in metallurgy that made this possible weren't the sole domain of the Europeans, lion's share of them happened in India and in the Middle East and then just propagated.",t5_2qt1p,1491109784,t3_5wpm7u,,deczcq7,

Yes, it's understandable. After all, for most people history is a series of vignettes with pyramids/gladiators/vikings/knights/musketeers/Napoleon/trenches/Hitler. You have to check those points and have to be careful about going to far into unfamiliar territory if you want millions of people to recognize what you're doing. And tech tree is evil indeed. Plus at least in Civ5 everyone on those tech tree and unit icons was white (with a possible exception of Arab in Chemistry).

Paradox have their problems too. I'm from Eastern Europe so I know Russian history. Crusader Kings 2 completely ignores complex succession laws in Rus (basically they all were of Rurikovich dynasty and rotated through titles with elder person ruling over Kiev. Plus there were sort of republics like Novgorod who invited a ruler from other lands to come as a lord with some limited rights). And Europa Universalis 4 portrays Russia as a land of mass armies which may be true by the 20th century but is not right in the period: in wars against Ottomans and Eastern hordes Russians had technological advantage without numerical advantage; two greatest victories in the period (against Frederick the Great and Napoleon) were achieved without numerical advantage. So they follow stereotypes or ignore important things.

About Wu Zeitan: yep, I was surprised too. First, I didn't know who the hell was she. When I first heard China will have a female ruler I thought it would be Cixi because she's actually a female ruler of China you may know if you live outside of China. So it's not trying to find a famous person, not the case of enforcing gender diversity (Theodora as a ruler of Byzantium is still horrible), it's just I don't know why. Maybe cause Cixi doesn't have a good reputation, I visited that stone ship she made instead of an actual military ship. Plus, there *are* famous and more representative emperors everybody knows.

Kosovo is a bit like Turkish Kurdistan -- very high support for independence but low development level.  But net freedom across the two territories may still increase with independence.  That is, Serbia might be less free if it still had Kosovo, and Kosovo would most likely be even less free.

For Bosnia I see more hope, traditionally Sarajevo was a quite developed place, and its score here is more or less in line with the region, and still freer than Armenia.  Probably the score should be specific to the different entities.  Republika Srpska (the part that wants independence from independence) is less free.

(I know Serbia well, have been a few times to Croatia and Bulgaria, and to all regions (Catholic/Muslim/Orthodox) of Bosnia and Hercegovina, and speak those languages not too too badly.  And German, which is also important there.  Never been to Kosovo.)

In a parallel universe where Azerbaijan were in the Russian camp and Armenia in the NATO camp, CNN would have demonised Azerbaijan and Azeris, the CIA would have funded the Lezgin separatists, Iran would have backed a Shiite militia...  It could end up like Bosnia (still freer than Armenia) or like Iraq.

We complain that the world does not pay attention to this conflict, but often when it does pay attention to a conflict, the result is much worse, especially further from Europe and closer to the Middle East.  Armenia, Artsakh and Azerbaijan are still safe countries.  (Azerbaijan is the least safe, but it's still about as safe as the US.)",t5_3dwnu,1491110379,t3_5wt2do,,ded0l3s,

Do not use Japanese 100-volt equipment on American 120-volt power unless its label clearly states that 120 volts is OK.

To be blunt, though, mugwort changa changed my overall view on DMT. No other herb has allowed to me to see behind the veil of how DMT operates. The combination of these two slows hyperspace down to a remarkably comprehensible pace. I remember my very first mugwort experience - I ended up in an archetypal 'operating' room with an entity who was in something of a major panic. It felt as though the mugwort was attempting to expose hyperspace as an illusion, a projection on a screen, while also showing me how other forces work behind the screen. That specific trip clocked in at 14 minutes, well beyond the usual time frame of a changa experience for myself. 

Knowing it is an herb tied very intimately with earthly functions (medieval Europeans used it as a magical herb to protect against evil spirits), I sincerely could not tell if it was only influencing my perceptions of hyperspace, or if DMT had been 'exposed' in some way. Further explorations with mugwort has yielded similar results.

Then came the Habsburg occupation against which we fought two bloody independence wars. The Nazis exterminated 400,000 of us. And I won't tell you about the horrors of the Communist occupation by half-Asian barbarians, but trust me, you would've rather been a Native American in the US than an average Hungarian farmer during the Soviet occupation in the 1950s.

 **comment content**: I would take more pride in their impressive ability to travel and spread their culture.  The modern myth of the bad boy Viking is a Victorian falsehood institutionalized by the popular media of the early 20th century that did not get academically dispelled until the end of the 20th century and is still gripping the common man, though less so in the last decade. 

Pretty much everyone at the time was violent and nasty.  The Vikings were mainly scary because they could move quickly and up and down rivers unexpectedly and they were Pagan.  They quickly moved across practically every major coastline in Europe and even at one point seriously blockaded Constantinople after settling in modern Russia in the early medieval period.

Some Vikings were able to integrate well.  For example, Charles the Simple of France signed a treaty with a Viking named Rollo (unsure if it's THE Rollo of Viking legend but it's supposed to be according to Medieval histories), who became the first ruler of Normandy (The name comes from the North aka Norse Men who also made up a significant portion of the duchy around that time) to defend North France from other Vikings and whose line eventually spawned William the Conqueror (Rollo achieved this by sacking Paris and Chartres while Charles was unable to protect his people).  Dublin and the Pale was originally a colony of Norse settlers.  The Byzantines hired the Norse as the Emperor's personal warriors for several decades after their initial conflict (including the one of the most infamous, King Harald Hardrada who in his youth served the Emperor before the invasion of England).  The eastern third of England for a couple centuries was called the Danelaw because the Anglo-Saxon lords had to acknowledge special rights and privileges of Dane and Norse settlers and pay special tribute after several successful brutal  Viking invasions.  Cnut the Dane ruled over all of England in what was called the ""North Sea Empire,"" which consisted of England, Denmark, Norway, and bits of Scotland in what was considered one of the first ""post-Roman, post-Antiquity, early-high medieval"" whatever multinational empires. Vikings were the ruling class of the first major ""Russian"" (very loosely used) states in the East, notably the Novgorod and Kievan Rus for a significant period.  Vikings were also the first Europeans to settle in America, which I believe they called Vinland, for several centuries before what they think was climate change and isolation caused the colonies to die off.

Prices kept dropping for the uncut (until 750g/each) but then just popped up, back to 1k each. However, the cut version was only 50g(!) more than the uncut version.

Yes, exactly. That's my point. Harry Potter is essentially the story of a powerful villain returning from the dead, but because it's framed differently - because the death happenes in the 'prologue, and the character and threat we actually came to know as the audience is the 'returned' form, it not only gets a pass but, due also to the strength of the writing, he becomes an iconic character. 

The same can be said of Sauron from Lord of the Rings.

I'm not necessarily saying that you should enjoy Dark Empire's take on it, my argument has always been that dismissing the notion of the Emperor's return from death in and of itself is wrong because these things can always be written well.

I see too many people dismiss the idea in the case of the Emperor because they hear the brief that he came back in a clone body and automatically assume it's stupid and a cheap cop out, without ever actually reading Dark Empire.

&gt; I don't think anyone expected Jon Snow to stay dead in the first place. 

You're not wrong. But mostly that was because the books already took great pains to show that resurrection was possible (Berric Dondarrion, Lady Stoneheart), and the way it was written meant there would be a sudden, huge hole in the narrative if Jon were to stay dead.

But again, that's my point. It's not seen as a cheap cop out (well, it is by some - but broadly speaking) because it was well written and properly telegraphed. If you tell someone the brief that in this story the hero dies but is brought back very soon after, there's a strong chance they'd write it off as crap writing without seeing how that plot develops.

And my argument is that there shouldn't be a double standard for heroes and villains. If audiences can accept their heroes coming back from the dead, so long as the scenario is well written, why not villains?

Again, I'm not necessarily asking you to see that Dark Empire's way of bringing back the Emperor was good (though I would hope you would at least give the series another shot, and try and look for its many merits). I'm just arguing against the statement that ""it was a repetitive process and using the same villain after their ""death"" seems like a cheap cop-out to me when you can't think of another enemy.""

&gt;I'll be completely honest, I've never heard of the Crystal Star

You should be thanking your lucky stars, then.

&gt;Not to mention the easiest redemption ever after Kyp used it.

Something which I would argue was taken to task very well in I, Jedi, the Hand of Thrawn Duology and the New Jedi Order. Seriously, there were several other authors who basically openly criticised KJA's writing by including Kyp in their own stories and having others yell at him or about him.

&gt;I'm aware that most people like that Maul came back, but he's really starting to overstay his welcome, and I'll be surprised if they actually kill him off in his duel with Obi-Wan

I agree he's overstaying his welcome, although weirdly I also think he's been underused in Rebels. I think a few more appearances could have made him a much more interesting antagonist for the Ghost crew, and they could have tied him better into the ongoing arc. He's lasted way to close to the OT period, though, and at this point I think he needs to go.

I, however, am fully expecting he'll be killed off in The Twin Suns. It's the perfect time to do it, and I can't think of a more fitting end. 

&gt;I care, because its existence is a good excuse to make more overpowered or ridiculous characters/factions 

I disagree. In general, I don't think most EU content creators looked to the games for inspiration, or for guidance on how things worked. KotOR is something of an exception here, but only because it basically defined a historical era. I think everyone realises the games often did silly things in the name of giving the player agency, and a fun experience. 

If there is fault, I'd argue it lies with the relentless nature of the continuity database and it's bizarre need to treat *everything* as canon. But I also think Wookieepedia magnified the effect of that on fans. They go onto a messy article for Tyber Zann, see a note that effectively says ""Leland Chee and the Holocron continuity database says this was canon, yo, so we are too"" and flip out because in their minds this Mary-Sue organisation is now as concrete in canon as Darth Vader being Luke Skywalker's son.

Actual authors, I don't think, would have ever looked at it that way. Hell, in the pre-Wookieepedia days I don't think most fans would have assumed it counted for everything.

&gt;and was a prime example of what was wrong with the EU.

This, to me, is a very retrospective opinion as a result. The EU looks bad and inconsistent and full of Mary-Sues or whatever nowadays because we now have the ability to instantly look back over the whole catalogue and see these little third party tags that say it has to be treated 100% seriously. 

It's why I actually find the new canon approach, the one that says everything is created 100% equal canon, interesting. I think it's working great now when the scope is small enough that everything is controlled and contained. But give it a few years and I think the cracks will show in a way that never would have happened if they'd just said at the beginning that some of this stuff will rely on more artistic license, rule of cool and what ifs than others.

What I said:
 &gt;secession is illegal

What your jurisprudence says:

&gt; In Texas v. White, the United States Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession unconstitutional, while commenting that revolution or consent of the States could lead to a successful secession.

So, short of specific consent, it is illegal.I never claimed that advocating for it is also illegal, just that it's a more extreme conversation to have than leaving the European Union, which has a specific channel for that to happen. I don't quite understand why you went on to ramble about the definition of treason btw, that hasn't come up anywhere in the conversation.

As for the EU's hypothetical misbehavior, I don't understand why you're missing the key point in this discussion: *Le pen did break the law.* The EU is not making up charges against her.

Even more scary they are all extremely boring and don't have to play up to any political audiences at home. Meanwhile everyone with an insight into the EU who could've been helpful in giving an honest picture has been sidelined. 


I'm likely biased as I work in Germany these days as a Brit but reading British media (even the non-brexit cheerleaders like the guardian etc) there seems to be a massive bubble in our media where they simply don't understand what the EU's goals are, let alone what their tactics will be. The political culture is different and when an EU politician who doesn't even control the final deal says ""we won't be vindictive"" - referring to not being actively malicious. this is taken in British media as ""they're rolling over and we're going to get special deals"". There is 0 understanding on what it means when Verofstadt says something versus what it means when Tusk says something versus what happens when Merkel says something etc etc, they're all just ""the EU"" as a homoegenous blob to our media. 


E.g there was this big assumption even from way back in the campaign that ""Germany needs to sell us cars so they'll give us everything"". Which is true, Germany does want to sell stuff to the UK, but a) Germany doesn't control the EU to nearly the extent they claimed b)  if  the single market collapses in order to save 5% of their trade then they've screwed the rest of their european trade. At the domestic level any Chancellor is going to lose an election 100% certain if they let the single market and the EU get screwed whereas a minor loss to car manufacturers isn't really going to do much more than lose some votes in a couple of areas.




This was held up as some trump card in Brexit campaign assumptions but is a relative side issue for the Germans and even more peripheral for the EU as a whole many of the countries within it (who all get a vote) barely trade with the UK and don't give a fuck about German cars only about the integrity of the market they trade with. A lot of those countries meanwhile are pretty pissed off about the UK playing silly buggers with the lives of their citizens in the UK and are not going to breezily let that slide so another own goal there. 


TL:DR they sidelined anyone with experience who could assess their strategy realistically and improve it to target real existing weak-spots. We're walking into this negotiation blind on what the other side wants and no-one important dares say anything. ",t5_2qh13,1491111778,t3_5wsrjf,,ded3h86,

Of course, it's entirely possible this could be more than coincidental, and that those chosen for the Presidency of the United States are selected in part due to their genetics, however that would be entirely hypothetical, with zero proof or evidence beyond the aforementioned and overall expected series of coincidences to support such a theory.

Para mim seria interessante acrescentar do clube que cada um herdou a performance dos cinco anos anteriores e assim fazer um delta do impacto que conseguiram ter. Porque ser presidente de um clube já dominador e depois ter os mesmos resultados é diferente de transformar um clube num de sucessos.

Eu não conheço a politica do Sporting por isso estas contas podem estar erradas mas, para ter mais ou menos o mesmo número de jogos, somei a performance dos dois últimos presidentes (191 jogos, 88 vitórias) e comparo com o actual (182 jogos, 115 vitórias) e percebe-se uma melhoria de performance (de 46% para 63%)

GDP is completely relevant because the benefits you will receive come out of tax receipts.  Less GDP = less taxes = you having less benefits and likely less forgiving tax rates too, making your life even harder.

If this is such an issue why don't we do some of it right now.  Nothing is stopping us.  We could have implemented controls on EU immigration.  It all comes down to this government, whether you are wrong or right about immigration.

My guess, based on my vague recollection of his 2.6.0 video, is it roughly neutral for European players.  (However, all of the European streamers I have seen thought it was a good improvement, but I have only seen a few). 

But for me in Australia a 75 MS improvement is a 30 - 40 % improvement (200MS minus 150MS due to server in Sydney vs. US, plus 75MS for degradation of movement = net 75MS improvement / 200 MS original = ~30% - 40% improvement)

But they *are* travelling. And I think this is a key point.  Just as the Holy Family were forced to relocate: first by the edicts of a power-hungry emperor, and then to flee violence, so to is *movement* a commonly shared experience among billions of people today.

Over the last few decades, a significant percentage of the world's population has [migrated](http://www.citiesalliance.org/node/2195) from rural locations to urban ones.  Today there are [244 million](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2016/01/244-million-international-migrants-living-abroad-worldwide-new-un-statistics-reveal/) people like me, who are living in countries other than where they were born.  As industries and agricultural environments rapidly change, as political systems experience upheaval, more and more people are finding it necessary to move from one location to another.  

And in addition to this, there are [65 million](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-crisis-migrants-world-day-un-a7090986.html) people who have been displaced by conflict - refugees, asylum seekers or those displaced internally. One for every 113 people on the planet.

And so we're entering into a world where *movement* is becoming a normal human experience.  Some get to do it by jetliner, some have to do it on foot in the dead of night.  And as an immigrant myself, I take comfort in knowing that the Holy Family *knew* what it was like to be forced to relocate because of circumstances outside their control.

Whatever this weeks political discourse in America is about, it's good to be reminded as a church that we follow One who was an internally displaced person and a refugee.  That Mary walked 70 miles whilst pregnant with our saviour, because she had no choice.  And that Jesus reminds us that 'I was a stranger and you welcomed me in.'

*Sigh*

Are there any liberals even worth debating in this world?

Yes. When you make it illegal to not have health insurance. More people are going to (against their will) invest in healthcare.

This is why Obamacare was technically considered a tax by the supreme court. Because you're forced into it.

You should be ashamed that it's not 100% of people insured. 

&gt;Even republicans are now talking about ""remove and replace""

No conservative ever wanted to pull the rug out from the people we made promises to. 

Thanks a lot by the way by creating a new group of people dependent on the government.

Explain to me how that's moral? Is serfdom moral? 

From what I can remember mankind was pretty happy to have those shackles taken off. To be free from the government deciding who gets to eat and who gets to live. For the people to have control over their own well being.

You seem to want to go backwards though. So much for being a ""progressive.""

&gt;because then they'll realize that the ACA was actually helping them and we cant have that can we?

Helping?

No. People are dependent on it. Like a child is dependent on their mother to shop for them.

&gt;It seems like the right thing because we have quantifiable evidence that it works the best for the most people

What the hell are you talking about?

No seriously. The ACA works the *best* for people? Like, out of ALL possible systems? Is that what you're saying?

We should just stop at Obamacare? Can't get any better than that?

You're talking nonsense.

&gt;and could actually reduces the amount of money that healthcare costs the country compared to our current system.

Can?

It didn't. It did the opposite.

It made healthcare *more* expensive, and less varied. And less reliable.

On average of course. 

https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=average+increase+in+premiums+under+obamacare&amp;*

There. I'll save you the trouble of typing it into google. 

&gt;But because we have proof that it works in the form of multiple other examples of it continuing to work, to this day.

Okay we're in full on liberal fairy tale land.

Tell me. Are you comparing the American healthcare system to European ones?

Please stop wasting our time comparing apples and oranges.

Look at the history of these countries and tell me how the quality of their healthcare progresses as the government gets more involved.

Go ahead I'll wait...

&gt;Competition in healthcare does not incentivise reducing costs,

Okay I'm done. 

This is like hearing a crazy person scream about how plants are actually people and can think.

That's how crazy what you just said is. I can't even get beyond it.

&gt; Beyond all the complexities of it that could take hours to discuss, how could you ever imagine that it would be cheaper to provide a service with more middlemen?

Health insurance is a completely voluntary thing. Well it used to be before Obama. 

It's not a middleman. It's an alternative way of paying. They *help* people pay for their healthcare costs.

That's like saying people that give out loans are getting in the way of people buying houses.

Dude everything you say is so ass backwards I honestly can't imagine where you even come up with it. 

&gt;If you want to even mention the national debt you should be worried about the military budget, not just these kind of comparatively tiny social projects.

The Military Budget makes up 15% of the budget.

And that's to defend the entire planet. 

Medicare and Medicaid combined take up 20%

Add in Social Security for another 20% 

And one more set of 20% for other mandatory entitlements (food stamps, welfare, all that)

That's 60% of our budget dedicated to entitlements. Gee. I wonder why the debt has been ballooning out control.

Be patient, first of all.

Next step: buy an old gods pack, that will guarantee you C'Thun. That lets you make a decent basic or budget C'Thun mage deck (or other classes), which will let you play and earn gold. This one for example: http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/503285-budget-cthun

Next step: always roll your 40g quests. The average quest gold is 53, so even 50g ones can be rolled if you have two other that are 60 or higher. If you get a quest that requires you to win with a class other than mage you can look up a decent basic/budget deck for it and play it in casual. ""Play x cards"" quests are obviously the easiest ones. Or just make a deck with your C'Thun for that class as well.

Next: Don't trash your whole collection just for one meta deck. If you know cards are actually shit it is ok to dust them, but other than that don't. Just buy classic packs until your classic collection is decent and make do with what you have. You'll get most commons and rares from packs anyways, so don't craft those either.

Next: If your classic collection has reached an ok size you can start looking at either buying packs from the newest expansion, unlocking adventures or playing arena.

Adventure upside: you know what you get and can unlock an adventure every like 2 weeks if you play efficiently.

Arena upside: at 3 wins you already get what you pay for. At 4 you have a small net gain. So if you can average at least 4 wins you will have a constant small net gain over time. If you average higher you can potentially play it infinitely to get unlimited packs. 7 wins guarantee your gold back in a single reward.

New packs upside: They often contain the strongest, meta-defining cards besides adventures. If you are not confident in your arena plays or simply haven't studied it enough yet, it may be wiser to just buy packs for now. Adventures&gt;packs overall.

If you have any more questions ask away or feel free to add Nynth#2606 on EU or NA and ask ingame.

Nope.  I am blaming the EU for apparently drafting legislation that allows companies to do things that the legislators probably didn't want them to do.

&gt; Which?

As I said... you didn't provide the imaginary legislation you wanted me to interpret.  And, by the way, in your scenario the ""invited"" an then ""uninvited"" person is never said to have entered the other guy's property at all.

&gt; Of course he can. The moment he utters the words 'You are uninvited' then the person in question is uninvited and thus a valid target.

Says you.  What the law says might be different, and since you didn't provide a legal text to interpret, we don't know what the law says. 

Arguing purely on the english semantics, since that is all we have in the absence of a law, it's worth noting that the online version of the OED doesn't even recognise ""uninvite"" as a verb.  

If I don't have an invitation to enter your property, but I enter it anyway, then I am entering it uninvited.  Even without your invitation, I might still have lawful reason to do so - I might be acting on a search warrant, or putting out a fire, or something.

If I do have an invitation to enter your property, but then you change your mind and would prefer me to leave, then we rely on the quality of the legislation as to whether or not you have the legal right to shoot me (an invited visitor) dead simply by preceding the shot with the three words ""I uninvite you"".

If you have that legal right, then whoever drafted the law fucked it up, and made your action legal.

If you don't have that legal right, then you should face appropriate charges in court.

Drafting laws means you have to think about stuff.

While world markets might take a hit, the reality is that Europe, Asia, Australia, Latin America, and (slowly) Africa have grown tremendously as consumer markets over the past decade, and overseas exporters will be able to absorb a lot of the damage as a result. 

While you are correct that we are capable of producing the majority of what we import, there is one major issue: we lack the facilities, equipment, and the trained workforce necessary to produce most of those goods, let alone to meet the demand. While I don't doubt that we would eventually rise to the occasion, the time it would take is measured in years, and the costs in the billions, if not trillions, by which point our economy would likely be pretty deep in the gutter.

This is why you see fairly good players at the likes of Southampton, Middlesbrough, Swansea and so on.  It's money yes, but also playing in the premier league that players want.   Another factor is Conte being previous Italy coach and knowing him well, and David Luiz seems to get on with him really well.   

None of that means he will move or even if he did it doesn't mean he will move to Chelsea.  However to say Chelsea can't sign superstars or high quality players isn't entirely true.

So, the region's wealth is, in many ways a by-product of Franco-german and Anglo-german trade. The same is true for a lot of the region's infrastructure, and banking system. Which is just fine and dandy until France, Germany, and England decide to go to war with eachother. (again).

I mean, they're these little countries with little influence and yet we sent a bunch of guys over to get killed and maimed, for what?

Korea and Vietnam were basically front wars against the USSR. After WW2, the world was basically divided into the US and our allies, the USSR, and the remaining territory that wasn't yet completely under the umbrella of either side (this is where the term 3rd world originally came from, though it's morphed in meaning since then). You have to remember that global communism was seen by most (or at least many) as great as a threat to the western way of life as Nazism. You can make a case that Stalin was worse than Hitler. He did kill more people.

The USSR was expanding. Russia didn't ""own"" the territory in eastern europe, but after WW2, the red army didn't leave. And then china fell into control of the communist party. Imagine the most hyperbolic version of what people are saying about Putin right now in Russia. This was worse than that. Ukraine, the crimea. Those places were held by the USSR. They were explicitly opposed to the American way of life. Think of if ISIS if it basically controlled the entire middle east, and you're getting closer to the scale of what we're talking about.

So people were looking at a globe and saw more and more of it going red. Sometimes explicitly being annexed by the USSR, but other times they were just helping the local communists and stirring up dissent in those governments. In Korea, the deomocratic government was being under attack by communist revolutionaries. The important political question for western politicians was what to do? You can't just keep giving ground. But you also can't just start another war. We dropped atomic weapons on Hiroshima just 5 years earlier. People were still shellshocked from WW2. The next war was going to be a nuclear war, and nobody wanted that, USSR included. 

So the public justifications for war got really weird. We basically stopped admitting that we were in wars, because if we were in wars, then why aren't we using the most powerful weapons we have? And if we do that, then the USSR will return in kind, and boom, now we live in Fallout.",t5_2w2s8,1491113752,t3_5wuxxl,,ded7jzp,

Its a ""company town"" - downward pressure on salaries - &amp; its a ""destination town"" - upward trend on housing prices/very low vacancy rate. Westchester money &amp; rust belt wages. 

Its also rather impossible to live a sober, mature adult life without a car. Even as a  25 year old who worked on campus, I was alienated from the majority of the peers I attended high school with. You need a  car to access the nature which the region is so famous for &amp; the people. 

I used to have to walk/bike down one of those hills to work at Wegmans in highschool....Don't underestimate february. You wont die, but you don't really see people walking with shopping bags late at night. Or..ever. Its very cold. 

The bike lanes suck, the hills take awhile to master (but once you do, worth it), unlike Europe you'll be 100% cut off from being able to take a train or bus into another city. If you're  riding TCAT as an adult, you're going to dissappointed with service on routes that don't get you to cornell. And there will be a...big huge normal american stigma to being a carless adult on the bus. 

Ithaca is a great place to party. If this guy is 24 and has a sense of adventure, sweet. 

But....from an  urban planners perspective....the town isn't that simple. The sprawled lansing / dryden suburbs are experiencing growth. Student housing is experiencing growth. But the town itself is having some pretty serious issues providing employment &amp; housing to non-student non-trust funders.

JD wants to nominate people to congress that pledge to take zero money from corporations or special interests. They also want to reform election procedure to get rid of the electoral college, first past the post voting, and the two party system. If successful, the latter would allow something like the Green Party or the Socialist Party to have a chance at winning seats in congress, maybe even presidential elections.

If there were no EU as such, only a greater EFTA, that would surely be the British dream scenario.

Leave only won by a small margin; if this plan had been the expected future Europe put before us, I think Remain would surely have won. But instead Leave won; as a result, for all that we liked the single market, now any attempt to keep that by means of EFTA will be rightly seen as an attempt to dodge the referendum result, to sneak back in by the back door.

I _do_ actually suspect an attempt will be made to sneak the single market in by the back door, but it'll need to be _very_ sneaky. There has been talk of transitional arrangements. It wouldn't surprise me if those amounted to EEA arrangements, justified as a temporary affair pending the negotiation of a comprehensive trade agreement. May can then issue everybody with blue passports and trumpet the progress of US and Commonwealth trade talks in all the papers, boasting of the success of Brexit; meanwhile talks in Europe slow down and stall, for the status quo really suits both sides reasonably well...

Even last year's TSM who was praised for their individual players didn't come close to SKT,ROX or even Samsung individually.

ROX had better players than TSM everywhere but midlane with none of the positions being a close call.

SKT had better players than TSM everywhere but jungle.

Samsung had a better toplaner, an equally good jungler, a slightly worse midlaner and a much better botlane.

Master Xul,t1_ded92qb,1,0,dented42ford,1488379564,False,heroesofthestorm,0,,False,"&gt; How does that work exactly?

By actually *living in Spain* and traveling around the EU a bunch.  I was talking about experience, not statistics.

&gt; I think my piece was pretty clear on this.

I think your piece was a bunch of self-serving drivel, but to each his own.  The original poster claimed that *all* europeans, in *his* experience, had little trouble communicating, notably *in English*.  He said that with an admitted bias towards northern Europe - him being Dutch, his examples Nordic and eastern EU.  My experience differed.

&gt; That's all true and fair, but how is this related to English classes, the part you brought up? Answer: It isn't.

Pedantic at best.  Sure, I quoted that part, just to quote something.  What do classes have to do with proficiency, or the experience of trying to communicate with those from these places in English?  Nothing.

&gt; Calling official EU statistics misleading but guessing the age of the playerbase. Not to mention 2008 is 9 years ago, so the people who these statistics apply to are now in their mid 20's. Means they'd fall under your guestimated average age. You're going to have to do better.

There *are no statistics* about the average age - there are plenty about *gamers in general*, and those track with my supposition, but that goes against your narrative (not that I'm quite sure what  is supposed to be).

What, exactly, is your beef with my statements?  All I was trying to say is that English proficiency in southern Europe is much worse than in northern Europe.  Nothing you have replied with has addressed this, other than trying to claim that studying English in secondary school somehow makes a population proficient in the language...

Which is idiotic!

Go to Texas or California and try to get by on *only* Spanish.  There is a *compulsory* 12 years of Spanish education there, too - regardless of the quality of the education, which your point didn't address, so this amounts to the same thing.  In my experience - I grew up in Texas - the level of English proficiency in Spain is about equal (maybe a tad better) as the level of Spanish proficiency in Texas.  Which is to say **BAD**.  Regardless of schooling.  Same goes for France and Italy, but not Portugal, Denmark, or Holland.

Nobody campaigned for it, and by actually forcing it as part of the narrative Grassroots actually succeeded in bringing VoteLeave into the immigration argument with a few weeks to go in the referendum.

At the end both Leave campaigns were campaigning on both Control and Immigration.

We can have both trade and immigration controls.  Maybe not as full and as free as what being in the Single Market meant but certainly a trade deal and with means to domestically offset shortfalls.

&gt; Without the headlong rush over immigration there could've been an EEA or EFTA type relationship where we agree to freedom of movement

I agree, but that was David Cameron's fault more than anything.  He gambled it all when his renegotiation fell flat.  And it did.  If at that point he'd said this clearly wasn't good enough, that he'd campaign to leave but remain in the Single Market, then given the margin of victory the Leave campaign had he'd have probably won.  He'd have still had to argue the immigration debate but would have nullified the fishing, right to negotiate our own free trade, and much of the reduction of bureaucracy/regulation argument.  He had of course ruled this out in October the previous year even before his renegotiation.  He desperately tried to steer his own cabinet members and senior Conservatives that wanted to leave away from the Grassroots Out campaign and into the then non-immigration based Vote Leave campaign.

We'd have left the EU but remained in the Single Market had he been bold enough to walk away from the renegotiation package.

As it was he didn't and the Leave argument on both Control and Immigration won, and exit from the Single Market was all but ensured.

May indicated in her nomination to lead the party that there could be no half measures and they'd have to acknowledge the immigration controls argument.  It had ultimately played a focal point in both the Remain and Leave arguments.

She had to say it to secure her own Eurosceptics in her party.  David Davis gave his endorsement as a Grassroots Out campaigner, and effectively she unified most of the party and its membership behind her whilst at the same time flanking UKIP.

Religious rules like islamophobia laws are false constructs of the International Institute of Islamic Thought, a Muslim Brotherhood affiliated group (http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=777) and coordinated to divide nations to conquer them through thought police management of language. This is not new or unknown and the US woke up to this issue a few years ago, which is one of the reasons why Trump was elected. Islamophobia is a term created by the IIIT to control the criticism of Islam in the west.

These are the same types of motions being passed by IIIT members and agents in every European country to shut down discussion about their motivations and exposing the agendas -- the Muslim Brotherhood is active all over the world and very secretive.

The false attacks in the news are used to eventually coerce sick members of society to invoke real ones by being manipulated through social media and urging by agents to perform horrific acts and then used by the IIIT affiliates to justify to further an agenda through these divisional tactics. Only fools fall for their narrative but the narrative is compelling. There are agents used to create these scenarios with grand objectives that are only know to the IIIT members.

Our slippery slope is started by falling for and allowing a motion like this that furthers the agenda of a caliphate state.

From what I'm reading here, He doesn't.

&gt;Is there a connection to the Indoaryan/protoeuropean/whatever sky god common to various cultures? 

Definitely not. One, language isn't THAT much a carrier of culture/religion that it does the equivalent of pickling deities like pig fetuses and bats in jars of formaldehyde, especially across oceans of time and between cultures that didn't have direct and prolonged contact. Two, languages like Egyptian do not belong in any way to the Indo-European family of languages. All stages of Egyptian language form the Afro-Asiatic family of languages together with the Berber, Cushitic, Chadic, Omotic, and Semitic language sub-groups.

&gt;My interaction with the divine has been focused on gods from my ancestral origins. This is kind of throwing me for a loop to suddenly feel a connection to a god from a different culture's pantheon. I suppose I am asking if anyone has similar experiences and how you folks think I should proceed in my study and practice if I want to include Horus. 

I think you should proceed, if you are genuinely interested in Ancient Egyptian history / culture(s) / religion(s) and ""doing justice"" to its respective Gods, by cultivating a genuine understanding of Egyptological matter. [I maintain a list of recommended textbooks concerning Ancient Near Eastern Studies](https://warboar.wordpress.com/recommended-reading/) more broadly, and within that, there is a section dedicated to Ancient Egyptian history, culture(s), and religion(s). These aren't the only works one ought to read -- I don't include articles, because most of those I would prefer to recommend are behind paywalls, and I assume most people who wind up on my blog aren't students/scholars with online database access. It wouldn't be fair to everybody to list the inaccessible. I'm also adding new titles to the list every few months as I get around to personally reading and evaluating decently-accessible texts. But, the works I list and their bibliographies will get you decently far in understanding the basics about Ancient Egyptian-anything, to the point where you can begin to distinguish reliable information from suspect information on these and related subjects.

One must also understand that there's not simply one Heru (Har / Hor / Her)-God. There aren't simply two, either. There are literally dozens of ""major, basic"" Heru-Gods, and hundreds more in the way of ""circumstantial"" Heru-Gods relegated to specific hours and events in the Duat, to celestial cycles, to individuated ritual moments -- the Late (Persian) Period temple of Hebet in the Khargeh Oasis alone has walls throughout its sanctuaries covered in both well-known, easily visually identifiable Heru-Gods and highly obscure Heru-Gods of perplexing forms wholly unrecognizable except to those who can read the inscriptions. Moreover, at Hebet Temple, *the God Set is shown in monumental relief as a Heru-God. Set is also a sometimes-Heru-God.* (See also De Garis Davies, Norman, *The Temple of Hibis in El Khargeh Oasis. Part III: The Decoration.* Publications of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Egyptian Expedition, Vol. XVII. 1953.)

Some of the basic and major Heru-Gods include: Heru-Nekheni. Heru-Behdety. Min-Heru. Heru-Buheni. Heru-Meseni. Heru-pa-Khered. Heru-sa-Aset-sa-Wesir. Heru-Sopdu. Shed. Sematawy. Re-Horakhty. Heru-em-Akhet. Harwyfy / Bawy. Heru-Shu. 

And *all of Them exist concurrently. They are not all ""phases"" of one-another. They are not ""past-form"" or ""current-form"" of one-another. They all exist as individuals together.* 

**In short: You need to figure out ""which Horus?"" before you ""include Horus."" They're not ""masks of the same God"" or whatever similar nonsense.** There are indeed outright syncretisms and tacit associations between Heru-Gods, between Heru-Gods and ""other"" Gods, but **this does not make all or even most of Them the self-same deity.**

There are a number of papers here and there on individual Heru-Gods, such as Shonkwiler's dissertation entitled [*The Behdetite*](https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/research-archives-library/dissertations/behdetite-study-horus-behdetite-old-kingdom#.WLNBNOHWbQ0.facebook), but others are addressed throughout core Egyptological works, including some of those I mention in my ""recommended reading"" whatnot. Above all, Their varied roles and functions and how They fit into the grander scheme of Egyptian religion(s) are addressed. It's infinitely more important that you first understand the *religious contexts* of these deities, as opposed to learning about the individual deities Themselves. Understanding Them individually comes a lot later -- which I mean in both in an academic sense and in a mystic sense.",t5_2rmnm,1491115622,t3_5wq2bp,,dedbf7v,

Well, concerning my zone, I live in Porto, Portugal (that's south-west Europe, by the Atlantic coast). How would that be categorized? 

As for available space, I have a small apartment with a small balcony. However the city does give people a few square meters of land in designated open areas for anyone wanting to garden. The thing is though I thought that before applying for that I should first get minimally familiarized with gardening and related stuff. That way I'd know I can succeed at ""Level 0"", if you will, before taking the public space someone else more experienced could be using. I don't even know how to work the soil. So my plan (and I welcome new suggestions or criticism) was to start with something easy at my apartment and then gradually progress. I guess container gardening would be the way to go at the beginning.

I have taken your point that the turnout in the AV referendum was low so that means that it sort of dilutes the ""mandate"" the referendum provided. 

However the turnout of the Brexit referendum was 65% and the 1975 referendum was a turnout of 64%. Roughly the same proportion of the entire population living in the country at the time voted, and in 1975 delivered a bigger mandate based on the proportion of British people that actually existed at the time. 

The only reason to insist the bigger number still matters in the face of that evidence, is to be disingenuous and attempt to fool people with misleading statistics. You're not technically lying, more people did vote, but that doesn't mean shit when only 20,000 more people voted for Brexit than to stay in the EEC but there were 14m less people living in the UK at the time.

From far Left to far Right. Any other model is based on bullshit identity politics and virtue signaling. Liberal, Conservative and Republicanism are the Centrists(sorted for which is more Left and which is most Right).

The Democratic process of voting is not a bad thing but a purely Democratic government can range from free to tyrannical depending on what the people vote for as the vote of the people is the highest power in the purist Democracy. Adding a set of rules that the vote must follow adds Republicanism to the Democracy deviating it from a pure Democracy. Generally a purist Democracy is going to be more authoritarian in nature; your Democracy isn't going to gather to vote on nothing. There is going to be some action that someone will wish to be voted on.

Equating Nazism with the Far Right is a clever strategy of Authoritarians to forever associate absolutist freedom with darkest villainy. It worked out for them that the Monarchists and Socialists of Europe at the time considered Nazism right-wing compared to their own politics.

Evangelical,t3_5ww3mj,-1,0,tomb523,1488383579,1488383818,TrueChristian,1,,False,"There is a lot of entire books written on this subject and I would encourage you to study in more detail than I or anyone could possibly answer here.

The modern day bible as we know it was essentially canonized under the guidance of Constantine, the first Roman ruler to recognize Christianity and make it legal.  Constantine was a pagan prior to his conversion and, even with his conversion continued to allow and participate in the continuance of pagan temples and practices.  There is evidence to suggest that many of the practices of the modern Church were a blending of pagan and christian practices.  Here are a couple of sources about his influence on the early Church:

http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/issues/issue-27/controversial-constantine.html
http://www.nationalgeographic.com/lostgospel/timeline_10.html

The OT is essentially the 3 Hebrew texts combined into one.  The Pentateuch (5 books of Moses) or the Torah,  The Prophets or Nevi'im and the writing or Ketuvim (Psalms and Proverbs).  The NT are comprised of Gospels which give an account from 4 witnesses of the ministry of Jesus as well as the events surround the Pentecost and a collection of letters written to the various churches and other apostles/disciples guiding the early development of those churches.  This collection is generally referred to as the epistles.  Most of these epistles were written by Paul who was the apostle chosen by Jesus to lead the gentiles.  This was most likely due to the bible being canonized by Constantine and what became the Catholic Church, a primarily gentile organization. Paul, being a former Pharisee probably was a more prolific writer due to his higher educational status and that, since his work was within the Roman empire, his writings were more accessible.

In and around the 6th century, the early Church determined that they were best suited to guide their members and so they made it illegal for a commoner to own a bible.  This was known as the biblical dark ages and gave rise to various institutions such as the inquisitions.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.  It was around the 15th century when the reformation occurred and men such as Wesley, Martin Luther, etc wanted each believer to be able to read and understand the bible for himself.  Tyndale was one of the first translators of the bible from the original Greek and Hebrew languages (Under Constantine, the bible was translated into Latin (which is why Latin is an integral part of catholic services)) into English.  Tyndale; however, never quite finished the OT translation, but the practice morphed into what is known today as the Geneva Bible or the Pilgrims bible as it was the bible brought to America by those fleeing religious persecution in Europe.

Again, there is a lot more detail on this subject than I can possibly convey here.  If you combine biblical history with secular history of the same period, you'll get a pretty good picture of the events surrounding
  

Edit:  The Apocrypha was primarily included in the Lutheran bibles, but also in some Geneva bibles as additional readings for historical understanding.  But they were never canonized as part of the bible. ",t5_2u489,1491116442,t3_5ww3mj,Evangelical,dedd4bl,

The company **boasts of having collected up to 5,000 data points on over 220 million Americans**. Secondly, it uses a unique method of analysis that doesn’t rely on traditional information, such as an individual’s geolocalisation, age or profession.

&gt;Instead, Cambridge Analytics creates a psychographic profile for each person. **The controversial practice allows the company to gauge a person’s intelligence and behavior through both objective and emotional information.** This data is used to draw conclusions about an individual, such as whether he or she is conservative, liberal or undecided, enjoys socialising, is easily upset, has a sexual preference, is recently divorced or is nervous by nature.

&gt;A campaign can then use this information to woo voters by **personalising the advertisements and videos that appear on their social media feeds**. For example, black voters in some states were targeted by content appearing to show Trump’s rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, referring to African-Americans as “sexual predators”, according to the website Motherboard. “Pretty much every message that Trump put out was data-driven,” Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander James Ashburner Nix told the publication.

&gt;In the UK, the Leave.eu campaign targeted prospective supporters by drafting dozens of emails that responded directly to their concerns based on information gleaned by Cambridge Analytics, The Guardian reported.

I remember being little and the dog being in a fenced yard and being really scary towards anyone going by the fence. My uncle told him to settle down and let us pet him, as long as we swore to never make a fist near the dog, as that was his hand signal to bite. It was a weird time. He no longer keeps protection trained German shepherds.",t5_2qhhk,1491117415,t3_5ww49x,,dedf567,

Everyone talks about promotion relegation but this would allow every decent sized city to have a team and bigger cities to have a couple. You would have less travel and more local rivalries.

And that is why blacks must be going around rubbing it into every white person's nose they see. The more they will rub it, the better they will be off. Or so they think.

&gt;For some reason I doubt you would consider a hypothetical Ango-Saxon history month to be racist.

Is ""Anglo-Saxon"" a race now?

&gt;  saying black lives matter also is not nearly as good

All lives matter. Somehow black lives seem to mater more to those who push this idea. Black racist movement that it is. You accuse me of ""repeated use of whites and blacks as though they are just groups of feuding tribes"". Though you are fine with BLM doing so.

&gt; your refusal to use the term African American

""African American"" is a bullshit PC term. Its use is invalid as long as ""European American"" is not used on equal terms. There are Americans. Or Blacks and Whites, otherwise.

&gt; The only people that have every seriously conjectured that ""blacks"" as eternal victims are racists 

Oh, come on! Black racism is the thing. Just replace white with black and black with white in the news and you will experience such a cringe. Black racism is rampant, it is just overlooked because of Liberal PC.

&gt; I do not understand your repeated use of whites and blacks as though they are just groups of feuding tribes.

You say this to me and then you go ranting about  whites and blacks as though they are just groups of feuding tribes.

&gt; ""whites"" do not have some unified culture

No absolutely unified culture exists anywhere. There always is diversity in any group. But speaking in relative terms, Whites indeed do have unified culture. The European culture. Which is not a surprise, taking into account how small Europe was. You can even find the same songs sung all over Europe in different languages. The Europeans and their ancestors DO HAVE a unified culture, thought with their local modifications. Take a Polish person and drop him in the white society of South Africa or Australia. He will feel at home.

&gt;  if you were to look at European culture in the same way that I showed African culture you would see a landscape just as diverse

No. That is not true.

&gt; cultures of Central Europe are so different from those of Western Europe

They are different. Certainly. The Dutch are different from Germans, Germans from Poles, Poles from Swedes. Still they are so much more similar to each other than to any culture outside of Europe. The analogy would be a family, where each kid looks different from the others, but they look even more different from their neighbors next doors.

The funny detail here is that the European culture has splashed outside of Europe and over the last 100 years or so become the global culture, so today everyone is a bit European. Which means that today you can find a black man who is ""more European"" in the way of culture than, indeed, some white man from Central Europe, but that does not mean there is no White European culture. It is just that individuals of different origin had been assimilated into it. And that is why BLM and other rabid black racist movements are so outrageous - they have been assimilated into the White culture but are trying to maintain their ""originality"", in the way of confronting the same culture they now are part of. The blacks would do better to either go color blind and forget about ""muh racism"", as Morgan Freeman once suggested, or get the fuck back to Africa and build their very own black African culture with mud and manure, as it used to be the tradition before the White men came.

Full disclosure: as an officer in the military, I see a lot more of the organizational and budgetary side of things than most, so I wanted to share my two cents on military spending and let you decide on whether we actually spend too much.

There's a lot of metrics people use on US budgeting. Let me explore some of these issues in detail and hopefully bust a few myths, give you a historical background, and tell you what we currently peg spending on.

**Military Spending - And Its Myths**

Yes, the US spends $600 billion dollars on defense. And yes, that's more than the next 7-8 countries combined (assuming China's budget is honest, which we believe is not). And yes, the US spends about 36% of the worlds total spending on military. 

But, as OP also mentioned, as a function of GDP, the US is at 3.3% - lower than some nations (like Russia) and a far cry from the 5.6% the US spent in 1988 near the tail end of the Cold War. [Source: World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS).

In the post WW2 world, this is at an [all time low per the CFR](http://i.cfr.org/content/publications/July2014/010_national_defense_1948.png) with it having peaked at 16% around the time of the Korean War.

So which metric is better to use?

Well the issue with looking at nominal spending is that nominal spending **doesn't correct for cost of living.**

Take into consideration what the military actually spends its money on. You can use [Table 5.1 of the GPO](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?granuleId=BUDGET-2015-TAB-5-1&amp;packageId=BUDGET-2015-TAB&amp;fromBrowse=true) or this nifty [Official DOD Budget Request 2017](http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2017/FY2017_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf) (yes, all this stuff is *public*) to see the pretty breakdowns. 

Per the GPO, for 2013:

* Personnel Wages - 25%
* Operations and Maintenance - 43%
* Procurement - 16%
* R&amp;D - 10%
* Atomic Energy Defense Activities - 3%
* Other - 3%

So right off the bat, we need to kill the myth that buying new equipment costs us the most money. It simply doesn't.

Why did I bring up cost of living? Let's take a look at personnel wages and benefits shall we. Per the DOD budget request, [this chart](http://i.imgur.com/rBRbrwH.png) shows that:

* $130 billion was requested just for military personnel wages for the 2.1 million active + reserve
* A total of $177.9 billion was requested on just military personnel wages + benefits 
* Another $72.9 billion was requested for civilian pay and benefits for the 760,000 civilian FTEs in the DOD
* A full $250.8 billion or 48% of the DOD base budget is allocated to JUST pay and benefits

What does this mean? Consider that a Chinese soldier is paid roughly a tenth of the wages of a US soldier. So sure, if we went to a Chinese pay scale, we could save $120 billion *overnight*. But that's neither feasible, wise, nor is it a good indicator of relative strength with China.

This is further exacerbated by the fact that both China and Russia have huge domestic arms industries producing goods at domestic prices. Furthermore, the world arms industry isn't an open market - the US doesn't compete with China or Russia directly as nations only buy from other nations they trust. The US buys domestic or buys from close allies like Belgium and Germany, who have comparable costs of production. End result? The US often pays 2-4x as much for a fighter jet than the Russian equivalent because US wages, US suppliers, and US maintainers all cost US prices, not Russian prices.

As a side note, this also irks me about the whole ""arms trade"" statistic and how the US is the number one exporter. Sure, by dollar amounts, we are - but our goods are magnitudes more expensive. The fact that Russia and China - producing goods at Russian and Chinese prices - are even close, should tell you who is exporting more physical quantity of goods, but I digress.

In sum, using nominal spending gives you eye popping numbers, but it tells you little about relative strength between nations. If anything, it should tell you how little Europe actually spends on defense (especially in comparison to Russian strength), and that China is a lot closer to the US than most people realize. 

**Waste Exists - But It's a Complicated Issue**

One of the top issues everyone talks about is waste. Let me first bust one budgetary myth though: use it or lose it is not a DOD only thing. It exists in all federal agencies (e.g. NASA, NOAA, etc.) because the budget is done annually. Money not used one year isn't seen again.

It DOES NOT mean you need to spend it to get it again next year - the budget request is done annually and things change based on need and what not. Admittedly though, it does make it harder to justify getting budgeting if you don't show need, so alas, the system is very flawed. Short of a congressional change to how budgeting is done though, we're in a tough spot.

Does waste in the military exist? Absolutely. Thankfully, people are noticing and paying attention - there has been a considerable shift in mindset in the past few years towards saving money. Of course this has to be balanced: you don't want to skimp on maintenance or training, as lives are on the line when things go wrong.  

In some areas, waste is also balanced by operational necessity. For instance, aircraft routinely dump fuel. In carrier aviation, we dump fuel because we have max landing limits - too heavy, and we can snap the arresting gear on the carrier or permanently damage our plane. Thus, if we arrive at the boat too heavy, the choice might be to dump thousands of pounds of fuel... or jettison even more expensive bombs. To the layman, it seems like we're burning fuel for no reason - but there's a rhyme and reason for it no matter how much it sucks. (And for the environmentalists, jet fuel is kerosene based - it's nothing like gasoline)

**Inefficient Spending Often Comes from Political Sources**

One of the big issues with the annual budgeting is that there is little long term continuity in a field that necessitates long term planning. For instance, the new class of aircraft carrier has been in the works for over a decade - and was planned out two decades ago. And yet, funding for it has oscillated year by year.

I'll give you an example of how political grandstanding has royally fucked military personnel and arguably cost us more money in the long run: sequestration.

During sequestration, a stop was put on training new replacement pilots for the fleet. Hundreds of replacement pilots were put on hold for a year. Well, since they just got their wings in training (costing roughly $1-2 million to train, each), you don't want to cut them from the military, but you still need to pay them.

But here's where the long term effects come in: every pilot in the Navy serves a 3 year operational tour before going back to become an instructor of some sort for 3 years. Whenever a pilot in the fleet is done with his first 3 years, a new replacement pilot comes in to take his place. Suddenly, the fleet had a shortage of pilots, and too many instructor pilots with no one to teach. And once pilots are done with their commitments, a lot get out to pursue other interests in the civilian world. Talk about a waste of human resources.

But this balloons further: a few years later, that shortage of pilots means fewer pilots available to be instructors. Fewer instructors mean fewer replacement pilots. Surely you can balance out how many pilots you bring in right? But ROTC and the Academy projects how many graduates they need from 4 years ago: suddenly, you have too many pilots-to-be and not enough instructors, and the fleet may need more pilots.

I could go into more detail, but the point is this: seemingly small disruptions have BIG ballooning effects on how the military operates.

Likewise, a lot of 'inefficiency' comes from conscious decisions to save money, believe it or not. Take for instance, the fact that much of US equipment is old. In the 90s, with the Cold War drawdown, we stopped a lot of acquisitions programs. Equipment in the military is designed to typically operate in 30 year lifecycles - the notable exceptions are things like capital ships (aircraft carriers). 

However, in the 90s, a lot of early to mid Cold War stuff was up for retirement - and instead of replacing them, their lives were extended.

This does, however, have an unintended effect on Operations and Maintenance - the US now has very old equipment to maintain. Some of our equipment is from the 1950s. I'm not even exaggerating - we have over 370 KC-135's, last built in 1965(!). For a long time - particularly with the Cold War drawdown - we put off replacing old equipment, but suddenly with a resurgent China and Russia, we've stretched a lot of these airframes lives out while in the late 2000's we finally sought replacements in the form of the KC-46.

All across the board you can see this happen. The F-22 was to replace the F-15 in the 90s/2000s, but was cut short and now the F-15 has had increasing costs rise to keep an airframe from the 70s and 80s flying. The A-10 was last built in 1984 - it was due for retirement years ago, but Congressmen (like McCain) have kept it alive long past their expiration date.

I hope this all gives a little insight into how a lot of spending issues do exist in the military, but the situation is far more complicated than a simple comparison of nominal spending with other nations, and how waste and inefficiency are complex issues within themselves - sometimes by design, sometimes by outside meddling.

First, there is a caveat though: The history of the Jews of North Africa under German and Italian occupation is not a very strongly researched subject for a variety of reasons. On the one hand scholars have long regarded North Africa as a side show for the Holocaust. On the other hand, access source material has been and still is restricted and/or hard to come by. As an example, the files of the German consulate in Libya were not accessible to foreigners during Gaddafi's rule and if they haven't been destroyed during the Civil War, it has gotten much easier to do research in Libya.

What is clear is that both in Libya and Tunisia, forced labor camps for Jews, who build fortifications for the Wehrmacht and Italian Army, as well as concentration camps existed, like those in Jado and Beghazi. Furthermore, Wehrmacht soldiers of the Afrika Korps took part in a pogrom against the Jews of Beghazi that left 67 people dead.

In Tunesia, the situation is more clear. Here the DAK collaborated closely with the Einsatzgruppe North Africa under Walter Rauff of gas van fame. Rauff  and the Wehrmacht collaborated closely in using Jewish forced laborers to build fortifications for the German army and in constructing over 30 concentration camps in Tunisia where more than 2500 Jews perished during the German presence there. Furthermore on July 20, 1942 Rommel issued instructions to Rauff and his Einsatzgruppe that once the Germans had conquered Palestine, it would be the Einsatzgruppe's task to kill the Jews of Palestine. Also, he allowed a Judenrat being established in Tunis and watched on when Wehrmacht soldiers plundered Jewish Ghettos in towns like Tunis and Susse.

In general, as Mallmann and Cüppers show in their article [Elimination of the Jewish National Home in Palestine”: Thee Einsatzkommando of the Panzer Army Africa, 1942](http://147.236.242.122/tomer/Mallmann-Cuppers2.pdf), the Einsatzgruppe Egypt under Rauff was slated to see action in Palestine, where it is very likely, that they were charged with murdering what Jews they came across there in the style of the Einsatzgruppen in the Soviet Union.

Where Rauff and his men didn't succeed with regards to Palestine, the Germans as a whole did at least succeed partially in deporting North African Jews to Europe and to their deaths. Albeit only numbering around 5000, many of them did perish in Auschwitz and other camps. Some of them also were deported as hostages to Bergen-Belsen, as this [list accquired by Yad Vashem](https://portal.ehri-project.eu/units/il-002798-o_41-1377#desc-eng) shows.

As far as can be told, the Nazis did not differentiate between Mizrahi and other Jews, especially since among those deported, there were Mizrahi. As for Ethiopia, I have never come across any reference to them in relevant literature or sources. It is my strong impression that the members of Beta Israel never really figured in Nazi plans, in large part because they could not get a hold of them. It is my educated guess that if they had come across them, they most likely would have started killing them off too. I base this largely on the episode concerning the Juhuro or ""Mountain Jews"" of the Eastern Caucasus and Crimes, which were killed indiscriminately by the Germans when they first came across them. Though the Germans later relaxed that policy on the basis of some pseudo-scientific findings about the supposed origin of the Juhuro and stopped the killing en large (as the only group where this was the case as far as I am aware), they still managed to kill more than a fifth of that group.",t5_2ssp3,1491118587,t3_5wq6hh,europe,dedhkmi,

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;(my scale is out of batteries)

First order of business: Replace the batteries.

It focuses this whole thing in your mind - a signal to yourself that you mean it. You shouldn't leave it like that any longer.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Thanks to medications I have to take, I don't feel full after eating a normal meal until 40 minutes afterwards. 

After you have eaten your meal, get into a habit: *Get out of the house.* Stay out of the house for 40 minutes.

For example, go for a walk around your neighborhood. Leave your money at home.

When you come back, you no longer have that ""free pass to eat whatever you want because of the medication"". This way you are doing something *deliberate* to take control of the situation, instead of just becoming a victim of the situation.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Also: how do I get more disciplined in not eating everything in my house?

I couldn't have stuff in my house either, like syrup or butter or anything else that I would quickly whip up into some sort of delectable dessert (the curse of knowing how to cook from scratch I guess) or just mix and eat.

In my case I was stuffing my face so I wouldn't have to feel my emotions. I felt bad about myself. Eating helped (temporarily) and then of course things got worse.

I don't know if you're having some similar thing going, or is it just physical hunger?

You mention drinking alcohol also, which might also be a means of escaping your emotions. What would happen if you didn't drink or eat, what emotions would come up?

Is there a way you can just sit down and let the emotions take over? Stop running?

&amp;nbsp;

That's basically what I did, I allowed myself to feel the discomfort without running away anymore.

I also removed all those yummy ingredients from the house. Later on I could handle it much better (I became better at handling my emotions without food or alcohol, I had started habits and noticed I could actually stick to something, which made me feel less like a victim and more like I could take control of things. This would probably happen to you too if you implemented the ""walk after dinner"" habit and stuck to it.)

&amp;nbsp;

Also... Alcohol will make you lose your inhibitions and go to town on everything in the cupboard. :P

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But how do I cook for 1 person? Everything comes in big packages.

Well, just buy enough for one. If you were in the U.S. I would believe that everyhing is in a huge package (because holy crap their packages) but since you're in Europe (like me) I don't think everything is.

Pay a little more for the small packages.

It's a small price to pay for your health.

&amp;nbsp;

Another suggestion:

* Buy single servings of the calorie dense ""big"" ingredients like meat, potato, etc

* Buy larger amounts of ingredients with less calories, like vegetables. You're not going to chow down on a raw onion. If you are still hungry after dinner, you're not going to break the calorie bank by eating celery, carrots, tomatoes, baby corn, lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, etc etc. Go for it.

About 783 million people don't have access to clean water, and about 6-8 million die a year from ""the consequences of disasters and water-related diseases"" which can be anything that is simply solved, such as dehydration or diarrhea. If larger economies wanted to do anything substantial about it, they could. But they don't. 

In fact we're coming to a point where we may not be able to do much about it at all. Water scarcity is continually going up, yet the demand for agriculture (which is where is where over 70% of freshwater can go towards) is expected to raise by about 19% by 2050.

Quality of team compared to last few years: We had to cope with players coming from our youth academy for some years due to financing of our new stadium which resulted in quality players such as Fekir, Lacazette and Tolisso. So we have a better team than we had for the last three to four years

Bells Eccentric Café 355 E. Kalamazoo Ave., Kalamazoo, MI 49007 https://www.bellsbeer.com/eccentric-cafe : The granddaddy of breweries in Kalamazoo, and Bell’s was on the forefront of the American craft beer movement.

Kalamazoo Beer Exchange 211 East Water Street, Kalamazoo, MI  http://kalamazoobeerexchange.com/ This is often voted as one of the most unique bars in the country because of its Stock Market style pricing.  The Kalamazoo Beer Exchange is populated with 28 incredible draught beers at unbelievable prices. Up-to-the-minute popularity determines pricing for each brew and in the most exciting moments, a Market Crash plunges prices lower than you ever thought possible!

First, it lost out on the musical chairs of the mega merger era.  Historically Peat Marwick was actually one of the larger accounting firms, usually #1 or #2 in the Big 8 era.  It is the only firm besides AA that didn't merge with another Big 8 firm.  It tried though, they had a merger agreement with E&amp;Y that EU anti-trust regulators killed in the late 1990s.

Second, they were embroiled in a nearly decade long criminal investigation into tax shelters.  Basically a handful of tax partners at KPMG were indicted, and the DOJ were considering indicting the firm as a whole, which would have led to its collapse.  This was right after AA collapse when it was indicted and the passage of SOX.  

Third, while the other firms were undergoing an era of prosperity due to the new work related to SOX, KPMG was fighting for survival.

There are many legitimate criticisms to be made about Churchill, but as a historian, I can tell you that this oft-cited one is overblown at best. I think it would be more accurate to say that even had Churchill been fully aware of the true extent of the crisis, there was actually little he could have done. 

Also, I don't think Churchill actually wanted to start a war with the USSR in 1945, he just considered it, and if ever you were going to start a war with the USSR, it should have been July '45, when the UK, US, and other Allies had superb armies on the continent of Europe, the US had The Bomb and the USSR didn't, and the USSR's industries were still largely in shambles, the USSR economy was totally dependent on US Lend Lease and food imports, and the USSR manpower pool was just about totally drained, not to mention their supply lines, which were badly overstretched.

Ramane doar sa iti solidifici increderea de sine. Eu am trecut prin scoala cu brio dar acum la 30+ realizez ca nu conteaza rezultatele, banii ti-i va aduce skill-ul. Cand e si skill si pasiune, e bine, deci da-i inainte cu ce-ti place. Despre facultate, nu trebuie sa te limitezi la Romania. Si nici macar la facultatile din domeniu neaparat. Ideea e sa faci o facultate usoara ca sa ai timp de treaba adevarata in timpul liber. Exemplu: am facut UniBuc Info, era cat pe ce sa imi mananc tineretea cu Automatica (dodged that bullet), dar acum imi doresc sa fi facut ASE Cibernetica pentru ca se zice ca e mult mai usor, etc. Recomand strategia asta.
Altfel, nu lua scoala prea in serios, ca e oricum outdated si pe duca sistemul actual. Daca treci esti bine. Also: fuck fizica predata in sistemul nostru comunist, protip: invata mecanica de pe vreun site online ca e super simpla prin comparatie cu manualele de fizica din a 9-a pe care le avem. Eu eram tot de 5 la fizica, desi olimpic la mate si info. Mai tarziu am invatat fizica in occident de 10, atunci am realizat ca de fapt nu am avut nici manual, nici prof, nici sistem bun.

Well actually, I think he tends to sexualize his female characters a little too much. I consider Murakami a guilty pleasure... :p It's also an interesting story when you consider that he really seems to like Western culture himself.

You're right, it could be interpreted a number of ways. It could even be as simple as Murakami showing the broken psyche of a white-worshipping Asian woman or bananarang haha. Could even be his version of the comments we write here? 

I think a lot of what he writes in this chapter actually would resonate with the crowd in this sub. There are a lot of connections between Miu's story and things I've read on here. For example, her hair turning white (after being ""defiled"" by a white man), her thinking of her Asian father (albeit positively) before she gets on the ferris wheel, her meeting a blonde german man in the park - one she says made her think of ""security""; the transactional nature of what was ""taken"" from her. 

When I read Miu's story though, it was before I found this website and its many asian subs. It kind of stunned me at the time, and it was an emotional read. As an Asian woman, I felt that the way Murakami sets up Miu's experience with racism in that little town was very relatable - maybe because I have also lived alone in a small European town. Anyway, sometimes men are able to let you know what is playing in their minds about you - even without saying anything explicit about it at all. I think this feeling is very well described in the chapter. My opinion is that Miu really did sleep with Fernando, and her ferris wheel tale about watching herself through her window is mostly made up. I think she is just having to look back objectively at an event she feels ashamed of. Isn't this pretty similar to how we think of past events or past regrets - almost like a third party objective viewer that's better able to consider all of the facts? For any on-the-fence-about-their-white-boyfriends Asian women, this chapter might change their perspectives, but I don't really know. ",t5_3amv4,1491120251,t3_5wseov,verified-AF,dedl0i5,

What would they do about balancing the budget? Good question and kinda similar questions being asked of the UK now re the EU I guess.

All I would say is actually, Ireland did run a deficit for years prior to joining the EERM and had to borrow quite a bit and the state nationalised quite a few industries, all compounded by the economic war. That said, pegging to a much stronger currency ensured stability for the fledgling Ireland as well as simplifying trade between the two islands. If Scotland does get independance (not on either side of the coin here, just saying if), they do have the advantage of having their own currency already pegged to sterling but of course could opt to ditch and join the Euro and perhaps devalue hugely between.

Muito do que me afligia estava ligado em como esses meus motivos não pareciam aplicáveis à *vida real*. Na maior parte do tempo era como se minha mente me dissesse que eu estava na trajetória correta mas ao mesmo tempo algo não parecia *encaixar*. Era um tanto quanto frustrante não me reconhecer nos ideais dos quais tudo indicavam serem os ""certos"" (em âmbitos financeiros, de relacionamentos, etc). Desde sempre nunca vi necessidade de buscar um caminho que me gerasse rios de dinheiro, ou que eu deveria ter como ideai alguém 'capa de revista', coisas do tipo.. e não só isso, mas coisas pequenas.

Pois bem, quando comecei a ler sobre budismo comecei a assimilar a forma da qual tudo era apresentado. Em como não temos controle do que nos é externo, em como não podemos no culpar/pressionar/martirizar pelo que não está nas nossas mãos. Saber que toda nossa experiência está diretamente relacionado ao nosso posicionamento em relação à nos mesmos e em como esse autoconhecimento nos habilita a sermos pessoas mais felizes consigo mesmo e, de tabela, uma pessoa que exerce um papel mais positivo e construtivo na vida dos outros.

Tudo isso me ajudou bastante em diversas situações típicas de dia-a-dia. Me guiou em um caminho mais empático (comigo e com todo o resto), tornou minha vida mais agradável. Antes, muita coisa me era confusa.. por exemplo, já tive diversas brigas com ex namoradas por elas se queixarem de eu não ser ciumento, de não ser um desse caras psicóticos, como se isso fosse sinônimo de amor. Era confuso argumentar nesses casos, me questionava se eu realmente estava correto de respeitar o outro ao ponto de confiar dessa forma. E até hoje sou assim, aprendi que essa queixa está mais relacionada a como as pessoas se sentem valorizadas do que de fato ""eu estar errado"".

Não comentei no post mas li bastante sobre a psicologia de alguns desses conflitos interpessoais, em especial relacionamentos abusivos. Todos essas coisas das quais influenciavam de um jeito ou de outro a minha vida eu fiz questão de entender melhor. No fim tudo foi se encaixando aos poucos. Aprendi a entender melhor os outros e a mim mesmo, o que eu deveria procurar e o que evitar.

Como comentei antes, abstraí a parte mais avançada por não ser o que procurava. Não quero me tornar um monge, não sinto a necessidade de me afastar de tudo que é terreno. Porém todo o resto me ajudou consideravelmente a melhorar e formalizar tudo o que eu sentia e também de entender e tratar as causas de várias coisas que me incomodavam nesse âmbito existencial.

He was attending culinary school in arizona and started hit it off with one of his female classmates.  They hung out and eventually it started looking inevitable that they'd start to date.  He made her an amazing dinner from scratch, they drank some wine, and they ended up in the bedroom where, apparently, everything went well.

Its VERY important you keep this a secret.""  he assures her he can keep a secret.   She then tells him an incredibly convoluted story that i'll have to paraphrase...   she claimed that she was the secret crown princess of a small european country called ""Genovia,""  she had been spirited away when she was a child to America because her evil uncle had usurped the throne.  She had a secret bodyguard she referred to as ""The Mark,""  who was always nearby, even if she couldn't see him.

I do think the FDA goes overboard. So many drugs work just fine in Europe and other places and never get approved here for very little reason. Clinical trials take much longer than they really need to, things that are 99% the same are treated as totally different. The best example is insulin pumps ""this pump is 99% the same as the older model with this one added feature"". These kind of things should just get a quick review from an expert not employed by the company and go to market. Instead the FDA dicks around for years getting them approved.

A good analogy I'd make is helicopter parenting. Just because one out of every 100 million helicopter parents happens to catch bowel cancer because they routinely examine the stool of their 10 year old doesn't mean the practice is healthy. Just like with parenting, I think there needs to be a balance between regulation and not impeding innovation.

Well I think here, he is being silenced because they're forcibly taking his sign, and looking very physically threatening. And I think I even heard outright threats from one o the guys saying he's red (that means communist I think?). I'm not saying people on the other side don't do this too btw, I know they definitely do.

I haven't seen all of bill maher's stuff, but I have seen some of it. There's one incident [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vln9D81eO60), which I think is a classic example of silencing coming from the left, where it really ought not to come out. In this clip, we see sam and bill well within the limits of what should be very acceptable debate, and Ben affleck attempts to in a sense silence them with the word racist, where it clearly doesnt apply. I know ben can't really silence them, its bill's show and he could have him kicked off any time, but this kind of attack, just reaching for the buzzword, would actually crumple a lot of people's confidence, and make them scared to ask questions like bill and sam are doing.

As i'm writing this I'm more aware of how non-black and white this issue is. You probably want to try to ""silence"" really dispicable ideas like the anders brevik followers. (I'm not abandoning my favourite little sign guy though, just gimme a minute). But I think maybe why the sign guy feels the need to be there is because of examples like this ben affleck one, and here in the UK, the immigration debate, which has been largely stifled for a long time by what I'd have to call some form of ""political correctness"". I'm not talking about the political correctness that stops youcalling a black guy the N-word, I mean the type of political correctness that essentially bars certain opinions from being allowed into polite debate. For a long time it seems like it just wasn't really acceptable to say you are anti immigration in the UK, then in comes Farage, sweeps up all these silenced people and Bam, we're headed for the Brexit. So I think sign guy is there in protest of all this in part.

"" You strike me as someone who isn't super involved in the leftist political world, because you're perception here is very much one-sided."" - I'm so happy you said this, and I'm really happy you have just broadened my mind. I have some super SJW friends (whom I absolutely love, and one of whom definitely would agree witht he ACLU classifying majid nawaaz as such, but yeah based on this, and Sam Harris' and Majid's complaining about it, I guess in my own mind I allowed the left to build up into a caricature. 

I don't want Obama to contribute to any fear mongering either. I think there probably is an issue in Islam at the moment, which largely isn't present in the other major religions, and I think that issue needs to be handled by very thoughtful intelligent people who can delicaltely dissect it, while remaining well and truly in the real world about it, and taking care to not stoke xenophobia in the process. Now that Obama, someone who looks like a lovely compassionate guy, and who is very intelligent and probably well meaning, has ducked the challenge, Trump has been the only one wanting to speak about this. I'm not saying trump has got the issue understood, but his saying ""there's something going on"", seems to resonate more than hillary or obama's obscurantism. Here is where the real meat of the debate lies: What is tht ""something going on"" that trump's identified? Sam Harris would argue that its partially down to the actual theology and structure of Islam as a religion, saying that the doctrine of jihad make members of the religion more prone to engaging in violence on behalf of faith, and that the lack of a designated leader of the whole religion (ie. they have no pope), makes it harder for a broad reaching message of unconditional condemnation of religously driven violence to be proliferated. Some people would blame geopolitical circumstances: they'd basically say: we've been bombing the shit out of muslim middle eastern countries for so long, this on the back of the historic conflicts of the crusades, means that religion has become merely a facade on the front of a reasonable want for retaliation against foreign military violence.

Maybe it's not so bad in the USA, but when people see all the terrorist attacks which have happened in europe (paris nightclub shooting, the nice truck attack, 7/7 bombing in london just to name a few) it puts people on edge, and i'd argue that their questions need to be addressed by an investigator who we all trust to be a fair and wise questioner, who deals in reality: AKA. Mr. Obama if he had done it. Now we have Mr. Trump to investigate these questiosn, and I'd argue if Obama and hillary had been more honest, we wouldn't have him in the white house today.",t5_2yrq6,1491121125,t3_5wgdpb,,dedmtt3,

Imagine if the USA was a small country with all the hoopla of the Hillary vs Trump. If you are up against a much larger foreign country with virtually unlimited resources and with a secret police that is happy to spend millions, if not billions, to make sure a coup happens, then it's likely going to happen IF that larger country has the motivation to do so.

That is certainly what the US State department and friends accomplished in Ukraine.  I don't know exactly how responsible USA is for the civil war to happen in the first place, but I do know the vast majority of 'rebels' are going to be foreign mercenaries trained and armed by USA and it's allies in the region.  This, of course, is the origin of ISIS (which is the sort of unintended consequences that result from this sort of behavior) 

USA Federal involvement in Syria was motivated by a number of different issues. Primarily among them are:

* The massive natural gas deposits (Leviathan gas fields) discovered off the coast of Israel, Lebanon, and Syria. This was discovered in the early 2010's.  It's critical that Israel has uncontested 'ownership' of the field so that USA corporations can gain access to exploit it.  This was successful.

* Stop the Iranian pipe line that was planed to run through Northern Iraq and into Syria. This was successful.

* Shutdown the last naval base for Russian operations in the Mediterranean. Since Russian fleet is non-nuclear this will cripple their ability to undermine USA 'gunship diplomacy' in the area and even out into the Atlantic.  The naval base is still open even though operations were heavily disrupted. 

* Syria is the last major Arabic secular government. USA allies in the region are essentially theocratic dictatorships and they want to make sure their brand of Islam is the dominate form of government for Arabic people.  This is not going to be a big motivation for USA Federal government directly, obviously, but I expect they are happy to let this happens if it keeps it's allies happy. This is why the 'rebels' have a propensity for targeting populations of Christians, 'incorrect' Islamic sects, and other religious minority groups.

The ultimate goal here is to shutdown, or at least severely diminish, energy flowing from Russia and into Europe. Which is also likely the primary motivation for USA involvement in Ukraine. With the push for 'green energy' it leaves Europe with natural gas as the only real way to provide electrical power for it's economy.  This puts USA (and it's allies) in a position to increase/maintain significant political and economic control over Europe as well provide significant profit center for USA-based energy companies.",t5_2qh63,1491121284,t3_5wwmx7,,dedn5oa,

&gt; Right-wing groups continue to represent a serious terrorist threat.

...

In the 1980s, however, the fortunes of the leftist movement changed dramatically as law enforcement dismantled the infrastructure of many of these groups, and the fall of communism in Eastern Europe deprived the movement of its ideological foundation and patronage.

I fully support the urge to not buy into echo-chamber talking-points and blindly regurgitate partisan rhetoric, but in this case it's a hard fact that left-wing terrorism has been a relatively negligible problem in the USA for 2-3 decades now, and right-wing terrorism is a significant problem, ~~since 9/11 *outweighing even deaths from radical Islam*, and officially making it the deadliest form of terrorism the FBI has to deal with.~~

&gt;As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I’m most often asked is ‘How fast would that SR-71 fly?’ I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It’s an interesting question, given the aircraft’s proclivity for speed, but there really isn’t one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute.

&gt;Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed.. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual ‘high’ speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn’t previously seen.

&gt;So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, ‘What was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?’ This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and I relayed the following.

&gt;I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England, with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refuelling over the North Sea, we proceeded to find the small airfield.

&gt;Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field-yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn’t see it. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren’t really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane levelled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass.

&gt;Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn’t say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet’s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of ‘breathtaking’ very well that morning and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach.

&gt;As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn’t spoken a word since ‘the pass.’ Finally, Walter looked at me and said, ‘One hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?’ Trying to find my voice, I stammered, ‘One hundred fifty-two.’ We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, ‘Don’t ever do that to me again!’ And I never did.

&gt;A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer’s club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, ‘It was probably just a routine low approach; they’re pretty impressive in that plane.’ ",t5_2qhsa,1491121640,t3_5wvm7x,,dednw48,

1.) The conquest of Iberia was, I think, a war of aggression, and thus morally and Islamically unjustifiable. 

2.) There is no comparison between the Muslim conquest of Spain, and the Reconquista.

Muslims, like they did most everywhere, displaced only the ruling polity, letting the local population carry on unmolested, and after a period of centuries, the locals peacefully adopted Islam. 

The Reconquistadors didn't just displace ruling elite, they killed, expelled, and forcefully converted EVERY SINGLE non-Christian, regardless if they were ethnically Arab or Iberian. 

3.) There is also no comparison between European colonization and Islamic Spain, with regards to treatment of minorities. 

European colonization, as an intentional rule, was violent, repressive, and exploitative. That was the inherent nature of the business, not a unfortunate by-product. 

Islamic rule in Iberia was a centuries-long, varied experience. Generally speaking, it was a tolerant experience for minorities, even relative to modern times. Yes, we can pick out an instance of a anti-Jew mob in 854, and a guy being killed for blasphemy in 923, but these were isolated instances. 

The problem however, is that Islamic rule dragged on, and the threat of Christian encroachment grew, we had the splintering of Spain into various Islamic-polities, with the added chaos of Almo-Muslims conquering parts from other Muslims. Here tolerance faltered depending on the polity/time, but even in the worst areas, anti-minority repression wasn't an ""all the time"" thing. 

4.) When I think of a Golden Age of Islam, I think of a time not when Muslims were necessarily super-tolerant/smart/powerful, but a time when Muslims were masters of their own destiny. Our fortunes were not dependent on the whims of Europe, our cultural/political intrigues not viewed through the lens of Western judgement.

For example, the hours of operation, the pay, etc, are all decided on by the workers.

&gt;The likelihood and magnitude of adverse labor market e§ects for natives from immigration are substantially weaker than often perceived. Within the large empirical literature looking at the e§ects of immigration on native employment and wages, most studies found only minor displacement effects even after very large immigrant flows. On the other hand, some more recent studies have found larger fects, and many studies note that the negative effects are concentrated on certain parts of the native population. **The parts of the population most typically affected are the less-educated natives or the earlier immigrant cohorts that is**, those who are the closest substitutes to the new immigrant to currently experienced by Europe

Of course immigration is a new win for the middle class and wealthy on paper. However they do little to create demand, services or jobs for the poor. Can you quantify decades of chronic joblessness in the African-American community for example? No you can't. We all know that mass low skilled immigration has made those jobs harder to get though. 

&gt;For the United States as a whole, immigrants’ share of total output was about 14.7 percent over 2009–2011. Note that this is actually larger than immigrants’ 13 percent share of the population.

What's your point? They are getting work because they work for cheap.

&gt;There are many ways to debate immigration, but when it comes to economics, there isn’t much of a debate at all. Nearly all economists, of all political persuasions, agree that immigrants — those here legally or not — benefit the overall economy. “That is not controversial,” Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, told me. Shierholz also said that “there is a consensus that, on average, the incomes of families in this country are increased by a small, but clearly positive amount, because of immigration.”

I posted this NY Times article to play ball with you buddy. Even that paper (though it vastly tries to minimize it) admits that low skilled workers are hit hard by immigration. It's a net positive, so what?! So *reality*. Our ""net postive"" has resulted in 11.1 million illegal immigrants, Have they factored in costs of deportation? What about the actual solution (like amnesty or the wall)? I don't think so. Economists are often brilliant folks, but fail to quantify social costs and hidden costs regarding complex systems. How could they quantify the cost of a drug gang like MS-13 on society? How do you quantify a dead border guard? An entire culture of depression? A broken home? I often support ""wonky"" approaches to policy, but this is woefully undersupported. The blatent attempt to minimize the economic problems associated with low wage labor is baffling! A wage depression on me or you isn't that bad. A wage depression for a family on the poverty line is devastating. There are not equal.

&gt;tl;dr - Economists have been studying immigration for some time. And thanks to the internet, you too can read their conclusions.

You straight up cherry pick data that says ""it's a net positive"" and tell me I'm wrong. Even though your own sources validate exactly what I""m saying ""We don't know enough"", ""Poorer folks get hit harder"", ""No we haven't factored in potential costs down the line"".

It's detached from reality! Have you been to emergency room recently? Have you ever had construction done? Have you worked with farms? There are 11.1 million people illegally in this country. 7 million are from mexico. You can't possibly think that that's a ""small net positive"" on our society. We wouldn't be having a debate if it wasn't. 

No it's not racism btw. Hispanics have been in the US for over a century. Hispanic cultures have been here for over a century.

tldr: Damn it already – let us filter!

A couple of questions:

Do we need to speak to City Officials or our MLAs?  It’s my understand that municipalities have the jurisdiction delegated by the province to control their roads.  For example, Burnaby could institute a filtering by-law, but Vancouver would not – which would make things very confusing for both drivers and riders.

I often thought about this as a two-step process.  A good start in the lower mainland is for the Province to institute a congestion law for filtering on BC highways.  If we could shoulder/lane filter during congestion on 1, 7, 7A, 10, 15, 17, 91, and 99 that would be so huge.  It would allow the drivers of the Lower Mainland to quickly becoming aware of filtering and what it is.

Filtering on other streets in the Vancouver might be hit and miss for the benefits – especially with the highly uneducated drivers we have.  That said, I am all for it as well.  For me personally I believe that someday a soccer mom is going to rear end me at a stop light in her Land Rover while on her cell phone ordering pizza for dinner.  It would have happened a couple of times already, but I’m very conscious of the driver behind me and always trying to assess whether they are on their phone or not.  Being able to filter at a red light would be such a benefit.

Are there some global resources we can look at for filtering to strengthen the arguments to Aldermen and MLAs?  Studies from the UK and Europe would be very helpful.  Also, it looks like there is a lot of action in the US – I would be good to have a list of what states are pushing this and the lines of evidence they have presented.  A dedicated website page with all these resources plus the proposed legislation would be awesome to point people towards.

Also, would we be able to get the support of the VPD motorcycle police?  They have always been so great when you meet them while riding your bike.",t5_2qi6d,1491122869,t3_5wranu,ca,dedqfkf,

They didn't and they don't.  You presented no sources of Orthodox Jews claiming this to be the case.  All you presented was baseless connections between a Greek legend and Moses (as I've shown), a misunderstanding of statements in the Hebrew Bible (as I've shown), and poor research you found on the internet claiming the Sabbateans have a connection to Neoplatonism (which reading scholarly writings will help with).

&gt; 2) Why did certain gnostic Jewish sects like the Sabbateans think Plato's idea for a philosopher king ruling class applied to ""people of Jewish descent"" even though they rejected Judaism and the God of the Torah, who is the only actual source of the idea of Jews being a divinely favored race that I know of?

Like I said, they didn't.  Go and read a book by a scholar rather than ravings on the internet.  Perhaps read Scholem and Idel, I assume you have not.

&gt; 3) And if that God was simply knowledge or gnosis, then why would knowledge or gnosis favor the same race as the God of the Torah did, when the Sabbateans would consider those things opposite? In Biblical terms, it sounds like the Sabbateans basically worshiped Lucifer, God's adversary. So if God chose the Jews, but the Sabbateans worshiped Lucifer, then why would the Sabbateans still believe their God, Lucifer, also favored the Jews, when Lucifer is supposed to be opposed to God, and God is the one who favored the Jews? Did the Sabbateans really believe both God and Lucifer favored the same people? Or how does that work, and what does Plato have anything to do with it, the ""aristocratic torah of Plato--the higher wisdom, of Kings and Priests"" and all that?

This question is based on aforementioned misunderstandings.  Additionally, Jews don't believe in Lucifer.

&gt; 4) How have Platonic ideas of a ""right to rule,"" or of superiority and supremacy, been infused within Catholic and/or Protestant Christianity?

There seems to be no evidence of this.

&gt; 5) Were those Platonic ideas ever applied to British royalty, French royalty, or other European monarchs throughout history?

No.

## A esquerda que aprovou a publicação das listas de devedores ao fisco e à Segurança Social, recusa agora informar quem deve aos contribuintes, via CGD, porque são os empresários amigos dos governos PS.

Comecemos por agradecer às divindades terem bafejado o nosso retângulo com tanta perspicácia. Nos últimos dias fizeram-nos obséquio de noticiarem que os homens heterossexuais desejam mulheres, perdão, que houve transferências, dentro do sistema bancário e com todos os registos, entre Portugal e *offshores* durante o governo PSD-CDS. (A propósito: se tiverem um assomo de rebeldia, sintam-se à vontade para noticiar o montante das transferências semelhantes ocorridas já no tempo novo da geringonça.)

A notícia de que a melhor lição sobre assobios veio de Lauren Bacall, desculpem, de que há transferências para paraísos fiscais, e a maioria dos comentários sobre esta magna questão, vieram em tom apropriado. Foi dito e escrito que milhões, ‘escaparam ao fisco’, que ‘fugiram’ para *offshores*. Fugiram, tal qual os meliantes que há dias fugiram da prisão de Caxias pela janela. Marotos dos milhões, que saíram à socapa (os registos todos não interessam) do sítio onde tinham a obrigação ética e legal de se manterem sossegados. Pior: estas transferências não foram tratadas pela AT, apesar de terem sido ‘denunciadas’ (juro que li num jornal) pelos bancos. Denunciadas – assim como se denuncia um vizinho que bate na mulher.

Políticos de esquerda não quiseram que uns poucos jornalistas fizessem más figuras sem companhia, e comentaram o dinheiro que saiu como se, em vez de dinheiro de privados, fosse dinheiro tirado às contas do Estado. (E ainda dizemos que Trump é que é viciado em mentiras.) O sempre infeliz (e desleixado com a verdade) Costa também falou em milhões que ‘fugiram’. É que nem é necessário, para estes lunáticos, verificar se as transações são legais. É dar ideia de que é mesmo dinheiro tirado aos serviços à população carenciada, para engrossar contas anafadas de corruptos de direita. Vergonha na cara e medo do ridículo, RIP.

Bom, digam lá: não tinham saudades, já há uns tempos, de incentivos deste calibre à inveja, à ignorância e ao ressentimento social?

Regressemos dos meandros de, no mínimo, açúcar em excesso onde estas conspirações fervilham. Até agora, e certamente não foi por falta de investigação jornalística (ou será que depois de feito o alarido perderam o interesse?), as transações para *offshores* não indiciam fuga aos impostos (escrevo antes das audições aos SEF). (Quem fugiria aos impostos através de transferências bancárias claras, cujo registo fica lavrado no sistema e são declaradas aos serviços fiscais?)

Pelo que, segundo o que até agora se viu, tratam-se de transferências legítimas de pessoas e empresas que movem o seu dinheiro licitamente ganho de um lado para outro, e de empresas que pagam a fornecedores com contas bancárias em *offshores*. É, para mim, intolerável que movimentações destas, aparentemente legítimas, sejam apresentadas como crimes de lesa-pátria só porque sim, porque somos um país pequeno e mesquinho que odeia pessoas ricas e torce o nariz socialista ao capitalismo. ‘Denunciar’, para repúdio generalizado da populaça, estes ‘milhões que fugiram’ é um perigo público vindo de quem pretende restringir a liberdade de cada um dispor do seu dinheiro como lhe convém. É defesa de uma ideologia proto comunista onde o dinheiro pertence ao coletivo, ao Estado, em vez de ao proprietário, pelo que não pode ser transferido para fora do país. Só se pedirmos encarecidamente e nos derem, com ar reprovador, autorização.

O que interessa investigar, nos responsáveis políticos como nos burocratas, é o apagão da AT com estas transações, tendo em conta que importuna os contribuintes (sobretudo quem não tem dinheiro para pagar a advogados e ripostar) por tostões. Ou por que razão o governo Sócrates tornou supostamente obrigatórias estas estatísticas, se afinal não eram obrigatórias mas sim dependentes de validação política? O gosto nacional por quinze patamares de vistos burocráticos não espicaça a denúncia? Nem os abusos das autoridades fiscais e dos políticos da tutela? Legislar de forma confusa para permitir todo o tipo de interpretações também é pacífico?

Já as transferências para as *offshores*, em si mesmas, parecem tão inquietantes como um comprimido de valeriana. E a não publicação das estatísticas sobre elas foi tão rotundamente grave que ninguém reparou que não apareceram.

Claro que este não-assunto *offshores* é muito mais escandaloso (desmaios, se faz favor) que a recusa de se dar informações dos devedores em incumprimento à CGD (i.e., aos contribuintes), apoiada em peso pela esquerda. Se os jornalistas das *offshores* quiserem, eu dou explicações sobre isto. A esquerda que aprovou (com Sócrates) a publicação das listas de devedores ao fisco e à Segurança Social, recusa agora informar quem deve aos contribuintes, via CGD, pela razão óbvia: quem deve à AT e à SS são contribuintes da ralé e PME indiferenciadas; já [quem deve à CGD](http://observador.pt/2016/06/14/caixa-tem-23-mil-milhoes-de-euros-em-risco-quem-deve-mais/) são os empresários amigos dos governos PS, incluindo [aqueles](https://www.publico.pt/2008/01/04/economia/noticia/joe-berardo-e-aliados-compraram-accoes-do-bcp-com-credito-da-caixa-1315596) que votaram na administração do BCP engendrada por Sócrates depois da CGD lhes ter financiado [compras de ações várias](https://ionline.sapo.pt/428731). Se os devedores fossem revelados, ainda ficávamos a saber para que serve um banco público.

Quantas calorias tem uma pizza. Se ousarem um registo mais sério, podem noticiar que temos eleições legislativas de quatro em quatro anos.

Whilst I was writing my dissertation on the theological formation and history of angels, demons, and exorcism, there were a few poignant texts, both from Jewish and Christian sources (mostly Catholic) that my supervisor and myself found to be quite fundamental. A good place to start, I found, was indeed at the beginning: 1 Enoch. This text (and yes, although it is not canonical, that doesn't mean it isn't right or true, at least in part) does seem to inform or influence Jewish and Christian thought, from the OT,  NT, medieval theology right to contemporary times. You would be surprised how much scripture there really is concerning angels and demons. As I go into in my dissertation, exorcism is a healing sacramental rite which was starting to take form way before its formal institution by Christ. We can see this in Tobit, where he exorcises a demon from a woman under the direction of the Archangel Raphael. In the Genesis Apocryphon, Abraham heals,  through exorcism, a Pharaoh. Jesus' healing ministry was principly made up of exorcisms, and he frequently teaches about it in the synoptic gospels. Anyway, I digress, other than the actual rites of exorcism, and commentaries on 1 Enoch and the Gospels, the below texts are a very select few from my bibliography, but were a good place to start (the texts by Tamm, Hauke, and Slyke are available as PDFs online if you google them):

 **comment content**: **Sickness/garbage bags:**  Yeah.  From the other comments, it sounds like giving away combination sickness/trash bags may be better than installing actual bins on buses.

**Public toilets:**  Wikipedia has an [article about pay toilets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_toilet).  I looked at it.  Here's some of what I learned:  Pay toilets can be found on the Paris metro, as well as in bus and rail stations in the United Kingdom.  It sounds like it's fine to install pay toilets in Europe, but politically unacceptable in parts of America.  In fact, it's illegal to install pay toilets in certain American jurisdictions, including Chicago.  I dunno about Salt Lake City.

[@AucklandUni's tweet](https://twitter.com/AucklandUni/status/836834245771472896) announcing the statement.

If you're wondering why University of Auckland issued a statement, I think people probably thought this is controlled or allowed by the University as opposed to being an AUSA (ie student association) activity. There is some truth in that because the University has a policy for [Zero tolerance for discrimination](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/eo-equity-office/zero-tolerance-for-discrimination.html). 


Background: 

* There's many clubs and societies at University of Auckland as there are at other campuses and even outside campus.  
* A club is part of the Student Association activities and during orientation week (or start of Academic year) there's stands set up for clubs to sign up members. 
* Clubs can be all sorts including political, cultural, around an community, religion, issue, sport, hobby, topic or activity.
* Here's the University of Auckland's page on [How to start a club](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/on-campus/life-on-campus/clubs-societies/how-to-start-a-club.html). It lists steps to be taken and provides a list of what benefits official recognition allows the club.
* If approved they can [apply for funding available to Clubs and Societies](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/on-campus/life-on-campus/clubs-societies/clubs-societies-funding.html). Next round closes on 2 April 2017.

But honestly I kind of like that about him? The usual Swedish stereotype is a tall, blonde, blue-eyed supermodel-looking woman with p0rn boobs who aloof and often super sexualized/slutty, and in Overwatch that means she probably would have just looked like Mercy but with double Ds and showing more skin, and I would have been asked every time I played her if I looked the same (instead of just getting the usual ""oOoOo a SWEDISH WOMAN WHO PLAYS VIDEO GAMES"" reaction that I thankfully only get once in a while now). I'm a lot happier being represented by Torbjörn tbh.

And he does have a Swedish skin, his basic skins have Swedish names and he has a voice line about being Swedish (which sounds like he's correcting someone who got it wrong, which would make sense with him sounding not-very-Swedish!), along with the IKEA spray, so to me it's not that bad.

China/Tibet is a great example.  But, there is no way for the UN to stand up to china, without causing a world war.

Syria is another great example.  The problem is, BOTH sides are committing war-crimes, and there is a SEVERE split, of opinion(Unlike with Israel, which has been nearly unanimously condemned).  

Kosovo is another example.  Once again, the UN has no power over Russia's actions, without causing a potential world war.

Israel isn't a world superpower, like the USA, Russia, or China.  Thus, the UN feels they can ACTUALLY force them to comply with the law(unlike the USA, Russia, or China).  

Is Israel being persecuted, because they are the worst nation out there?  Not even close.  I'm not arguing that.  They're being persecuted, because they're the worst nation out there, that is reachable to the UN.  If ANY smaller country started taking land from a country, they would similarly be persecuted.

Why would every nation in the UN(including a majority of nations in the Western Alliance) criticize their ONLY ALLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WHO PROTECTS THEM AGAINST RUSSIAN EXPANSION TO THE MIDDLE EAST, if they didn't have reason?

Israel is INVALUABLE to Europe, and America.  I, personally, don't think they would be throwing their relationship with the only western nation in the middle east away, unless it was with good reason.  Israel could easily side with Russia and China, instead of the West, and I'm sure the west is aware of this.

It comes down to politics.  5 nations have PERMANENT veto power at the UN.  China, France, Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  These nations, REGARDLESS of whatever the UN says, can self-veto any measure.  Israel does not have the same veto power these nations have.

This fits perfectly of course into the colonial narrative of the 'decadent' influence of the Ottomans who brought the Arab world into decline whilst the 'light of civilization' was transfered to western Europe. The West would then use said narrative to depict colonialism as a reinvigoration of the Arab world released from the grasp of the Ottomans. 

Unfortunately, many Arab nationalist movements bought into this interpretation as they tried to legitimate the 'long-encumbered essence' of their nation that was overridden by various foreign rulers (thereby establishing a continuity between Western colonization and the Ottoman empire). Of course, Ottoman rule was nothing like European colonization : throughout the Arab world there were various local forms of government that had a significant degree of auto-determination vis-a-vis Istanbul.",t5_2qt0d,1491124282,t3_5wx42k,VAT,dedtcp0,

&gt;&gt;Over the course of three albums for Warner Brothers in the 1990s, Mr. Bungle created music that defied description. Borrowing from avant-garde jazz, ska, metal, and pop, the Northern California band intrigued critics and created a large cult following. Ernest Agbuya in Chart Attack described ""the baffling vocals of Patton who, by turns, wails like an Eastern-European gypsy, [and] croons, screeches and gurgles,"" and suggested that this was a band that fit in no category. Mr. Bungle also entertained audiences by wearing masks and costumes, and gained a reputation for its bizarre stage shows. ""It's hard to describe Mr. Bungle's music,"" wrote Adam Levy in Guitar Player, ""any other way than 'bizarre.'""

In many countries, especially in Europe, the question was ""We have a country, how do we govern it?"" That is, the existence of the country is taken as a given and the constitution simply describes how the government should be organized. In countries like these, when there's enough unrest that they decide to adopt a new constitution, those in power get to stay in power (mostly) and the government can hobble along until it can regroup.

The United States is different. When the 13 (former) colonies wrote the US constitution, the question was ""We need to create a country, what form should it take?"" The United States of America DID NOT EXIST as a nation until the constitution was ratified and crated it. In a sense, you could say that the constitution IS the United States of America.  The US constitution can be changed via the amendment process, but if the USA ever decided to throw it out whole cloth, the federal government would immediately lose all power. The President, Congress, the Supreme Court, and all of the supporting institutions would lose all legal power they had and all government responsibilities would revert to the States until (and if) a new constitution could be ratified.

The reason that the US constitution is treated as sacred text is because in a sense, it is. The government is not allowed to pass any laws that contradict it (and it's the Supreme Court's job to enforce this), and if they ever tried to throw it out they would all immediately be out of a job.

Limburg,t1_dedb7ax,1,0,silverionmox,1488402376,False,europe,0,,False,"&gt; Yes Bilaterism is impractical when it comes to the amount of countries you mentioned. As I said, a few countries with similar visions should pilot the whole thing outside the EU. If interested countries reach a certain threshold, it can be made mandatory by the EU, abolishing the whole bilateral stuff.

The problem with that approach is that other countries may want a say in the organization, so it would just postpone the discussion, and necessitate costly reorganization to accommodate the changes.
Worse, you can get different groups that become entrenched in their different approaches (path dependency) and you end up with a schism. If there is a frontrunner group, there should be only one.

The benefit is that it makes things go forward and incentivizes to be part of the frontrunners. 

So I still prefer a complete approach where everyone is on board from the beginning, with smaller groups being less preferable the smaller they are. Of course, bilateral initiatives is pretty much where we are now, so anything larger would be progress and I agree with you on that.

They also are just doing politics. More and more people have been eating up the propaganda of how Israel is literally the worst country in the world. So if you are for Israel, then you would lose votes and no politician would want that.
