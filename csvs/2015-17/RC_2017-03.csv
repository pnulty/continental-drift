Sexual crimes includes everything from showing your genitalia in public and saying inappropriate sexual things to rape and buying sex and human trafficking. 

&gt;Sexualbrott är en brottstyp där det är relativt vanligt med upprepad utsatthet. Drygt en tredjedel (35 %) utsattes för två till nio händelser under 2015. Drygt en tiondel (12 %) utsattes för tio eller fler händelser. Av alla som utsatts för sexualbrott har alltså sammanlagt 47 procent utsatts minst två gånger under 2015. Antalet händelser uppgår uppskattningsvis till ungefär 482 000, vilket är avsevärt fler än något annat år. Dock har antalet händelser varierat kraftigt över tid, vilket visar att de årsvisa resultaten ska tolkas med försiktighet. 

This section from your link explains that sexual crimes are often repeated between the same offender and victim. 

Sweden count every single time a crime is repeated in the statistics unlike some other countries where a man raping his wife 100 times might count as one criminal act. This is often mentioned when explaining why people like to call Sweden the rape capital of Europe. 

Furthermore it says that a third of the victims in 2015 were victims 2-9 times and 10% were victims more than 10 times, with the same offender. I think it's pretty clear that these type of victims are couples with one abusive partner. 

Lastly, the paragraph explains that 2015 saw a big increase in the number of sexual crimes but this statistic should interpreted carefully. It goes without saying, if a husband rape his partner 1000 times and was convicted in 2015 that's a dent in the statistics that doesn't mean there are more rapists out there.",t5_2qofe,flag landskap-uppland,decg8wi,t3_5wrds4,

 &gt;Dear [insert senator/representative name],

&gt;During an interview with Fox News' Brian Kilmeade, President Trump revealed that he has no plans to fill approximately 600 vacant positions in the State Department. This is both ludicrous and irresponsible.

&gt;As I am sure you are aware, the State Department is vital to our country's relations with foreign nations. The United States needs a robust and well-functioning State Department to ensure the safety of Americans both abroad and at home. Additionally, a State Department manned by competent and qualified personnel, with an emphasis on diplomacy, is integral to preventing international situations, such as war, and encouraging peace, prosperity, and understanding both in the United States and around the globe. Failure to recognize the importance of the State Department is grossly irresponsible and will harm American prestige and endanger American lives and economic interests.

&gt;With tensions around the world rising, particularly in Eastern Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East, the mission of the State Department is more important now then ever. I beg you to encourage President Trump to take his duties more seriously and to reverse this dangerous and reckless decision.

 **comment content**: Japan in the springtime was lovely, I enjoyed seeing the cherry blossoms.

Anywhere in Europe is always a plus. I enjoyed Paris a lot. Madrid and Barcelona were great (and the men - *damn* ... I'm sure the women are nice too if that's your preference). Rome was a lot of fun. I enjoyed Riga more than I thought I would. Vienna was great, especially if you're a culture buff. Pretty much anywhere else that I've been in Europe has been good.

Bali was great, but I think I was there at a different time of year. Unsure what late spring would be like or the weather patterns in that area. Thailand is great to visit, the best beaches I ever saw. Singapore was a bit of a letdown, but could be nice if you like to do a lot of shopping.

I enjoyed Egypt a lot, but that was back in... uhh... like 2009/2010... and a lot has changed since then. 

You can bungee jump from Victoria Falls, which was a hell of an experience... and then go on Safari in Zambia.

South Africa was beautiful, Cape Town especially. I wish I had just gone to Cape Town and not Johannesburg.

In Israel I spent all my time in Tel Aviv and was not sad for it. The same comment I made for Spain ... the men... oh my god, the men...

Costa Rica had some really cool ecotourism stuff that I heard about but didn't get to do (I was there doing primatology research, so didn't have a lot of tourism time). But I found the people to be warm and kind, and that's always a plus.

I don't think I've ever regretted visiting a place. In my opinion, throw a dart and go. There's good food everywhere. There are great people everywhere. There are incredible experiences to be had anywhere. You have the chance to go, so just go anywhere!

&gt; The Blind Boys of Alabama are a gospel music group from Alabama that first formed at the Talledega School for the Deaf and Blind in 1939. 

&gt; Although the Blind Boys of Alabama have been singing gospel music for more than five decades, it's only recently that the group has had the benefit of a major record company behind them. The founding members were Clarence Fountain, Johnny Fields, George Scott, Ollice Thomas, and Vel Trayler. The current group consists of Eric McKinney,  Billy Bowers, Jimmy Carter, Joey Williams, and Donald Dillion. 

&gt; From their inception in the 1930s, when all were boys, all members of the group except one were blind. They began singing when all were students, in the glee club, at the Talladega Institute for the Deaf and Blind in Alabama, but didn't begin recording until 1948. As a youth, Fountain heard the legendary Golden Gate Quintet on the radio; the early Five Blind Boys of Alabama took their musical cues from that group. The group began singing professionally as the Happyland Jubilee Singers, and for years only toured the Bible Belt in the Southern U.S. 

&gt; Since 1948, they've recorded for a variety of small record companies, and had gospel music hits in the 1950s with ""Oh, Lord Stand By Me"" and ""I Can See Everybody's Mother But I Can't See Mine"". In 1950, after the death of one of their members, the group renamed themselves simply the Blind Boys of Alabama. 

&gt; The group recorded first for the Newark-based Coleman Records label. Between 1953 and 1957, the group recorded for Art Rupe's California-based Specialty label. In the 1960s, the group's hard-driving gospel sounds were imitated by people like Bobby ""Blue"" Bland and Marvin Gaye. The group recorded extensively for the Vee Jay label from 1963 to 1965. In 1969, Fountain left the group for a decade to try to make it on his own, and the group re-formed with all the original members in the late 1970s. 

&gt; They gained widespread success in 1988, when they starred in an Obie Award-winning Broadway show. According to Fountain, the group's high point was being on Broadway for 15 weeks with the musical Gospel at Colonus. The musical opened up new avenues to bookings for the group, and they began touring theaters and larger churches in the early 1990s, embarking on their first European tours as well. The group was awarded a National Heritage Fellowship in 1994. In 1994 and 1995, the group played festivals including the Philadelphia Folk Festival, the Beale Street Music Festival and the King Biscuit Blues Festival. The group also toured in Melbourne, Australia  and the World's Fair, in Brisbane.
 Mid-1990s television appearances included Black Entertainment Television's On Jazz, and even a cameo on Beverly Hills, 90210. 

&gt; Since the turn of the century, founding members, George Scott (2005) and Johnny Fields (2009) passed away. Clarence Fountain remains the only living founding member.   The group is still performing, under the vocal leadership of longtime member, Jimmy Carter. Releases by the group in recent years have been favorites at the Grammy Awards — they have won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album every year since 2002. The Blind Boys of Alabama were inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2002. Their cover of the Tom Waits song ""Way Down in The Hole"" was featured as the opening theme for season one of HBO's The Wire. In 2008 they released Down in New Orleans, on which they were accompanied by such Crescent City legends as the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and Allen Toussaint. Read more on Last.fm.

I'm sure FSG will sell if they think it's necessary. But I worry, the best owners in Europe have bought clubs as projects to satisfy their egos. We look more like an expensive cash cow that needs austere measures to be properly milked than a desriable project. And I don't think we are being milked quite yet, just growing the overall portfolio of FSG. Also TBH, a super rich owner would rather have their teams in London, Paris or Milan than Liverpool.

I have extreme doubts we'll find any one in the world who wants to buy us for a billion pounds and then immediately spend another few hundred million on players. We are just in a tough position, plain and simple, neither rich enough to compete nor desperate enough to be a project. We probably have to work through it, grind it out, year after year.

That was one of the ideas that has been considered but is generally thought to be incorrect. They were/are a shared culture that arose among various communities and societies. Trade routes and to a lesser extent migration probably connected them. Britain was much more insular, though, than the continental Celts.

They also spoke different languages and dialects depending on region, even within Britain. (British Celtic languages are often referred to as Insular Celtic.) Atleast this was true later on, as Bede references in the 8th Century various Briton groups being unable to understand each other very well and that a Gael named Columba needed a translator to speak to a Pict.

There's some legendary references to pre-Celtic Britain in Lebor Gabála Érenn, but it's very difficult to verify what is mostly fact and fiction and it's considered pseudo-history. It was written in the 11th Century AD and features stories from the preceding centuries.

Honestly, I wish I could give you more information but there's nothing very solid, if anything, about pre-Celtic Britain's culture and language on historical record. 

There's various archaeological records, though. But I don't think that really pertains to the scope of your question.

It's possible that some studies on Insular Celtic Languages and their development could interest you. There's a lot of ideas floating around about the development of Britain's Celtic cultures and languages. Common ancestors among ICLs that are not apparent in Continental Celtic languages have been proposed.

HE’s a player that supporters “pay money to go and watch”, but Sydney FC’s hopes of keeping playmaker Milos Ninkovic beyond this season remain in the balance.

Sky Blues boss Graham Arnold said the club would not know until the end of the season whether a contract pitch centred on living and working in Sydney would hold sway over multimillion-dollar offers from the Middle East, and persuade the former Serbian international to re-sign with Sydney.

Exceptional all year in Sydney’s charge towards the Premier’s Plate, Ninkovic has deflected all queries about his future — certain to be fielding offers at least equal to the US$800,000-a-year contract Qatari side Al Gharafa tabled before the start of this season, a deal to which Sydney refused to agree.

Ahead of Friday night’s clash with Melbourne Victory, that could carry Sydney to the brink of winning the minor premiership, Arnold said that Ninkovic was one of the finest players the A-League had seen, and acknowledged that his eight goals and 10 assists this season make him a hot property.

“We’re working hard on his wife and his kids — happy wife, happy life, etc,” Arnold said. “Ninko’s in a good space at the moment and he’s such a fantastic person. He’s enjoying life here in Sydney, he loves the club and sees what we do for him to be able to perform at the level he’s at.

“We’ve had discussions, and they are that he wants to wait until the end of the season. He’s got one thing on his mind and that’s winning, that’s all we’re looking at the moment.

“He’s definitely in the top five (players to have featured in the A-League) — he’s exceptional. He’s a player like Diego Castro at Perth that you’d pay money to go and watch. He does things on the pitch that are top European quality.”",t5_2wgd6,Brosque,deciswo,t3_5ws2ed,

Mithraism, on the other hand, was a mystery cult, perhaps comparable in operation to Freemasonry or Scientology today. Even the lower ranks were only available to a small amount of people, and the ""more advanced truths"" would have been withheld. These cults seem to have existed throughout pre-Christian Europe due to the inherently decentralized nature of polytheism, but once they had to compete with an intolerant universalist force like Christianity their low membership made them extremely vulnerable to persecution and assimilation.

- Christianity seems to have offered a much clearer theology. This is part of why many Germanic and Celtic tribes converted to Christianity early on - the idea of one God and one set of stories written down in a book was much more potent than the idea of many different gods and regional spirits with their own quirks, myths and legends.

- Christianity did not demand the kind of sacrifices that other religions demanded. It was enough, especially for the poor, to believe in Jesus Christ as the gateway to the one true God and for them to behave as the church wanted them to behave. Christianity typically did not demand human sacrifices or payment-for-truth, whereas the Germanic and Celtic faiths demanded human sacrifice and Mithraism - like the Oracles and Priests of the Greek and Roman pantheons - seems to have had an element of payment-for-truth.

- Christianity added something that most of its competitors at the time did not: a view that everyone who behaved in a way that even a lowly farmer could behave with the right amount of effort could earn life eternal without pain, suffering or fear. If we look at the Germanic polytheistic afterlife in contrast, some of the violent/brave who died in battle could look forward to an afterlife of perpetual battle and feasting until the end of time (when they'd be called on to fight in one apocalyptic battle which they were fated to lose), the less brave/violent but moral and healthy could look forward to living in the fields and more moderately apportioned feasting halls (purgatory, essentially) and those who misbehaved or died of frailty or dragging diseases could look forward to spending the rest of their days in more misery. Of Mithraism's proposed afterlife we know preciously little, and mere initiates probably wouldn't have been told about it anyway.

- By the time Mithraism was 'defeated', Christianity - which was a very intolerant belief due to its monotheistic, universalist nature - had gained the support of the most powerful state in existence - the Roman state, which sought to eradicate Christianity's competitors in the same way it had once sought to eradicate Christianity. By the late fourth century, sacrificing in superstition (to pagan gods) in Italy carried with it the death penalty, and Mithraism would have been considered an unlawful superstition.",t5_2qh4j,,deciwtg,t3_5wogjo,

Will there ever be enough legislative progress that we can take a sigh of relief and say ""finally, we won; we have a right to privacy?"" It's amazing to me that Privacy International, the EFF, ACLU, and others have to fight so tediously and expensively in court when the Fourth Amendment (in the US) and other constitutional protections in other countries should so obviously settle questions about domestic warrantless surveillance, smartphone encryption, etc. Do you ever get feelings of complete exhaustion, like it's always an uphill climb and the system is rigged?

I 'm with reason, and that requires a lot of skepticism, especially when the subject matter is an idea that can easily stoke populism (e.g. eugenics/racism).  I think the current polarization is counterproductive and should come to pass in a few years. There are some 'leftist' ideals that one can subscribe to  like atheism , or a social safety net. I don't understand when the left became the party of ""homosexuals, no borders and gender quotas"" only. Those are marginal issues alien to older leftists, and of course irreconcilable with TRP.

Para fazer exatamente as mesmas provas, seu filho do homeschooling teria que aprender exatamente o mesmo assunto que foi dado na escola. Agora me diga por que diabos um pai ou mãe da ""elite educada"", que trabalha 8 horas por dia, iria gastar outras 5~6 horas para ensinar exatamente o que a escola já ensina? Metade do trunfo do homeschooling, que seria a liberdade do que ensinar, vai por água abaixo quando seu filho tem que ir para a escola da mesma forma que antes e quando você tem que seguir o mesmo currículo que a escola. Pergunta aí a qualquer pai com filho se ele estaria disposto a fazer isso se fosse permitido e você já sabe a resposta.


Aluno não presente em sala de aula também não pode participar de trabalhos, seminários, discussões, testes, e outras tarefas avaliativas, o que implicaria em ter provas diferentes para eles. Escola não se resume a provas, como você deixa a entender. Por isso seria uma carga extra para os professores. 


Fora as outras atividades que o aluno ficaria excluído, como excursões, debates, rádios, esportes e todo tipo de interatividade que a escola promove para melhorar o bem-estar dos alunos e a relação entre eles. Tudo isso juntando crianças de diferentes etnias, regiões, classe socioeconômica e outros perfis que um pai/mãe comum não tem tanto acesso quanto uma escola tem. A escola se foca nisso, enquanto igreja e família não tem essa função nem obrigação.


E por mim vou parar a discussão aqui porque o ponto principal já foi dito e não adianta ficar discutindo detalhe a esse nível. O tópico perguntou o que eu acho, então tá aqui meu pensamento. Homeschooling não é o capiroto e eu entendo seus pontos positivos, mas mesmo assim sou contra.

This organization soon lapsed into inactivity, only to be revived by the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP) and Hồ Chí Minh in 1941.[1] The Việt Minh established itself as the only organized anti-French and anti-Japanese resistance group.[2] The Việt Minh initially formed to seek independence for Vietnam from the French Empire. The United States supported France. When the Japanese occupation began, the Việt Minh opposed Japan with support from the United States and the Republic of China. After World War II, the Việt Minh opposed the re-occupation of Vietnam by France and later opposed South Vietnam and the United States in the Vietnam War.

Also just because they were communist does not make them part of the USSR 'empire' even if they were allied with/supported by the USSR. From the ICP's own objectives:

&gt; MEPs have voted to lift Marine Le Pen&amp;#039;s parliamentary immunity to allow French prosecutors to take legal action against the far-right leader for tweeting gruesome images of killings by Islamic State militants.

&gt; The decision to end Le Pen&amp;#039;s immunity has still to be confirmed by MEPs at a European parliament plenary session on Thursday, but this is seen as a formality after the approval of the specialist committee.

&gt; MEPs enjoy immunity to protect their freedom of speech, but the right is linked to their work in the European parliament and can be lifted after a request from a national authority.

This eventually formed the basis of a European standard for coinage in the 19th century, the standards of the Latin Monetary Union.  These standards were used even by countries not in the Union; standardized coinage had a lot of benefits, and given that coins were still precious metal this was a lot easier than an international fiat currency like the Euro.  So people across Europe got used to 20-cent coinage.

2020 - Land a decent job, maybe start dating my future wife

2025 - Get a job that's not intro level

2026 - Turn 30. Hike the Appalachian Trail (or at least a significant part of it) by now. Hopefully engaged/ married by now.

2030 - Would like to have my college loans paid off by now and at least own a home by now. I have very low expectations and am very thrifty so I'd like to think I'd be about half way through paying off my house by now. Prefer living in a medium sized town (population between 25k~150k).

2035 - Travel a lot more by now, I'd like to see Australia, Iceland and go back to Europe. I'll be 39 by now so I feel it'll be my last chance to go out while I'm still pretty active and healthy (not that I can't later but I know it does start to go down hill around then.

2040 - Hopefully have my house paid off or very close by now, move up in my job again by now or sooner. Consider selling my house if it is paid off to buy some land and a smaller home as my possible kids move out and move out to a more secluded place (population under 10k).

2046 - 50 now, I don't want kids but if I do have them my youngest will be at least 18 by now. Even if I did have kids, the oldest I'd try for is 32, I don't wanna be in my 50s with my kids still in school. I'd want to be healthy and active enough for them to have me around for them.

2055 - Hopefully retired by now, I'll be 59 but again I'm very thrifty, don't want kids and have a higher earning potential (Comp Sci).  

2060s - Do a lot of travelling/ exploring. If I have kids they'll probably have kids by now, enjoy time with my family when I can. Maybe live out of an RV for a while.

2070 - I know the point of this sub is making it 100 years but I honestly don't plan on living past 75 barring some major improvements in quality of life for the elderly. Kill myself in some way, planned out ahead of time. How to Die in Oregon style.",t5_3ip69,,decomwa,t3_5wlw5h,

Here's why:
Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

Ok here goes :


&gt; It's higher prices for UK consumers like me and presumably you who wish to purchase non-EU goods and services, and reduced trade for our exporters.

This isn't the case though, we are already seeing price rises which will increase once we are paying EU tarrifs on food and such after leaving the single market. I don't understand what makes you think prices will go DOWN when we leave the single market, every expert in the county of note says otherwise.

Yes we pay tarrifs on stuff we produce in the EU, like farming (which also leads on to the CAP). The fact is though that even if we leave the EU it is highly likely we will subsidise farming in a similar way and most likely we would have tarriffs to protect our own food production. This isn't for economic reasons but for food security reasons, if we don't we risk going back to WW1 levels of vulnerability in food production. There again, our government is mad so who knows.



&gt; Free trade is usually good for the economy which is usually good for employment, living standards, real wages etc.
In any case single market IS the best trade deal, so this point is shite as well.
Agreed, but should we take single market with 16% of the world at the expense of trade deals with 84% of the world?

This doesn't make sense to me, trade deals are not free trade, trade deals are protectionism agreed between countries . If you are a free trade advocate you should be in favour of being in the largest free trade area in the world. I don't think you really understand what trade deals are for or why they came about to be honest.

You seem to think that trade deals will offset the additional costs from leaving the free market and there's nothing to indicate that will be the case. The biggest barrier to imports isn't tariffs, IIRC average tarrfis across products on WTO rules is 2%. By far the biggest barrier to trade with china or US is transport costs when it comes to goods and we sell them relatively little in the way of services because of regulatory barriers, most service exports are to europe.

I think this is a huge assumption on your part that any trade deals will necessarily be befifical to us byond what we have already with EU negotiated trade deals. In fact I don't see how it's possible we can negotiate anywhere near as effectively on our own,  this is before you get into the fact that May wants a bit of paper to wave after she gets off a plane so she isn't going to be as picky as she should be, just look at the recent shambles with the US visit.





&gt; Well it's not loads in the grand scheme of things no - £13 billion in 2015 if you're interested, but it should be virtually nil.

&gt; I don't need to give an example, it's about the principle of the thing, mate. UK voters should ultimately have a say in how they are governed. As things stand, UK laws are overriden by EU laws when they conflict, this is inherently wrong IMO.

Yes you don't need an example and I'm gonna consider this my point unless you give me one. Otherwise you're just objecting to nothing at all.


Dude, from your own link : The UK pays more into the EU budget than it gets back.

In 2015 the UK government paid £13 billion to the EU budget, and EU spending on the UK was £4.5 billion. So the UK’s ‘net contribution’ was estimated at about £8.5 billion. I don't even know why you put that in there when you have the correct number just below...

The benefits we get back in terms of all that free trade you like so much is MILES more than 8.5 billion. We export something like 200bn of goods and services to the EU for fucks sake.

&gt; Well that's just factually incorrect. In 2015, the UK's ‘public sector receipts’ amounted to £4.5 billion. So overall we paid in £8.5 billion more than we got back, or £23 million a day. The Treasury figures note payments the EU makes directly to the private sector, such as research grants. In 2013, these were worth an estimated £1.4 billion, so including them could reduce our net contribution further still.

Dude this is nothing LIKE the only benefit of single market membership. We do 200bn in trade with europe for one thing, have access to a massive labour pool and we can send our own people to work over there or expand business into europe easily and all our regulations are harmonised, the benefits of this are massive.  Some reading : https://www.ft.com/content/1688d0e4-15ef-11e6-b197-a4af20d5575e


&gt; The way the EU works is that it takes UK taxes, skims off a slice to fund its administrative costs, then redistributes the rest, and does a poor job of doing so - as I said have a google on what the EU spends its money on, there is some shocking waste.

That's not at all how it works, there's loads of projects from research to social projects, the arts and the EDC and it's really just your opinion that it's wasted. I feel the EDC has been invaluable for investing in areas which would see fuck all from our government (say hellow Cornwall, Wales and Northumberland!). So I simply disagree it's all wasted and as you are making the claim you can provide me some evidence before I take that claim as read.


&gt; Are you saying the UK has full control over its immigration policy?

Yes you can be refused entry for any number of reasons, don't you recall Geert Wilders being banned?


&gt; Not being funny mate but you've made some straight up incorrect arguments here. Tariffs put up prices for UK consumers, we are prevented from making trade deals with the rest of world and there is no evidence that we won't be able to make them just fine on our own.

No mate, it's you who is incorrect, you are assuming that trade deals will be better than the single market and you've submitted nothing to make me think that's true. Tarriffs do not necessarily increase prices for goods here, they only increase the prices for *imported* goods we don't already produce here, like food. 

In any case, it's not me you are arguing with on this point it's the economists who really know this better than you and I (I would suggest at least!)

&gt; Reducing trade barriers between the UK and the rest of the world is a laudable aim and would
be likely to increase trade and raise UK income. But it is not an adequate replacement for EU
membership. The best-known fact in international economics is that international trade and
investment fall substantially with distance (Head and Mayer, 2014). Doubling the distance
between two countries roughly halves the trade between them. The UK is much closer 
11
geographically to the EU than to other large economies such as the United States or China
and, therefore, it is not surprising that roughly half of the UK’s trade is with the EU
(Ottaviano et al, 2014).
Put another way, it is geography rather than policy that makes the EU the UK’s most
important economic partner. Simply reorienting the focus of the UK’s trade policy away from
Europe will not change this underlying reality. Whatever agreements are reached with
countries outside Europe, the most important decision facing the government following
Brexit would still be the future of the UK’s relations with the EU.

I guess I fit as your study subject.

Came from eastern europe about five 5 yrs ago, came in my 20s.

You could only notice an accent only if you had a long discussion with me. I'm white but you can see that I'm not German or from central europe, where most people in K-W are from.

Came here with the idea to study because I already had a clear idea that I wanted to be a researcher. 

Planned to get a job until I started studying, tried all sorts of places like Mcdonalds, Tim Hortons. Was only contacted by a selling agency that was basically conning people into selling their products. Got really depressed because I thought that, unlike back in my home country, it all depended on you to make a decent living. Was very dissapointed. Turned to people that came from the same country as I came(for a job), but they treated me horribly, made me think only the worst come here(from that country). They also informed me that you need ""references"" to get a job around here, a thing that's basically considered as part of ""eastern european"" corruption back in my home country. Couldn't really make friends within this community because most people in it are middle aged or older. They are way more fucked up than the youth in my country, way more narrow-minded, I got exactly what I ran from.

Stopped working and contact with the aforementioned community because I got in UW, but the school is really not for research, been to the counselor(the mental one) and she confirmed that  ~ 75 % of students are in for a degree. Was very disappointed in the school, mainly because I had teachers that literally could not speak english and expected from you to replicate material from class, instead of accepting alternative correct solutions to say problems(in maths). Chinese students are very very unwilling to have anything to do with you, which leaves you with very limited options. Regardless, made some friends, mainly from eastern europe(some grew here). Generally speaking, students here are way more narrow minded compared than the youth back in my home country, so I was used to speaking my mind and received negative feedback(meaning in terms of libertarian thinking not that I wanted to invent rules or laws, rather in the sense that if I did not agree with a teacher's perspective I was discouraged from criticizing him/her). Anglo Canadian students seem to be quite xenophobic, similar to Chinese ones. I expected a world like you see in the American movies with race not being a barrier, but could not be further from the truth. Even when you walk on the streets, you are way more likely to see groups of same colour/ethnicity rather than mixed ones.

Osap did not cover the tuition and I heard Canadians got more than needed. My parents did not earn enough to cover the fees(they had minimum wage). 

Had trouble with money, went to Lutherwood Employment to get a job. Their programs are for people with disabilities but they crammed me there anyway, I don't know why. With all the schooling and technical skills I have, all I got was a plywood cutting job and a job where I was supposed to come up with ideas of how to teach disabled people to use computers, so not even Bestbuy  wanted me. They kept bringing the reference thing as if it's something normal but if your an immigrant clearly it's going to be unfair. Was thrown all kinds of subtle racist shit from the coordinators at Lutherwood like: ""Why didn't you contact your community?"". When I told them  that my problem is that I don't have references and that all I needed was an opportunity to show that I'm capable of doing the type of jobs I was looking into, was told in front of the whole group(this came from a redneckish guy in the group):"" I can be your reference if you mow my lawn"". I just smiled and did not react, anyway.

The regulation in general is harsh for immigrants, like the car insurance is really high, even if you have 20 years of driving back home.

I got my driver's license back home and it's harder to get it back there because of the way older cities are(and they're with manual transmission). Took some in car classes with an instructor anyway. First thing the examiner did when she saw me was to yell:""Say your name"". Me:""Do you want me to spell the name or pronounce it my native language?"". She screams again:""Say your name"". That's how I started the drivetest. She talks all the time I was in the car. I read the whole Driver's license book, I know she was supposed to not talk. Failed me. So what bothered me was that I had to pay for classes again in one month(won't let you book earlier) and pay the fee which all amounts to a lot of money.

It's like the whole k-w system imposes immigrants to scrap shit(do manual labor) for a few years regardless of anything. This mechanism got better through the years I guess.

I guess every thing's harder because people tend to not be cooperative with you. Think of prisoner's dilemma - they tend to deflect.

There's a big issue and I say you should not bring immigrants at all.

&gt; The Toy Dolls are a British punk rock band. They formed in 1979, playing their first ever gig at Millview Social Club, Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, UK, on 20 October 1979. After a couple of gigs, vocalist Pete Zulu left to form his own band. He was replaced by Paul ""Hud"" Hudson, who himself left after a single gig, leaving Toy Dolls as a trio with guitarist Michael ""Olga"" Algar to assume vocal duties. This was just the start of the revolving door of drummers and bassists that would characterize the Toy Dolls line-up over the years.

&gt; They quickly built up a local fan base and were initially grouped with the Oi! scene that was emerging at the time, although many would say that despite having the singalong choruses that are typical of Oi!, they are better classified as pop punk. Another reason they are associated with Oi! is that they were championed by Garry Bushell who was heavily involved with Oi! bands such as The Angelic Upstarts. In 1980 a local businessman financed their debut single, ""Tommy Kowey's Car"" with ""She Goes to Finos"" on the B-side. The single quickly sold out its initial 500 pressing but the band couldn't afford to press any more, making the single a collector's item.

&gt; In 1983, they released their debut album Dig That Groove Baby, by which time with Bushell's help they were beginning to attract national press attention, and in 1984 they burst into the charts with their punk rendition of ""Nellie the Elephant"", a classic children's song, which reached #4 in the UK charts and stayed in the Top 100 for no less than 12 weeks.

&gt; The Toy Dolls have since changed their lineup and record labels, establishing and cultivating fan bases in Europe, America and Japan, continuing to release new singles and albums.

Protein
Carbohydrates

The carbohydrates come from sugary substances. You can use fruit but I'd recommend you either make honey water or sugar water, put it in a syringe and feed your ants that way. This way, you can give them a perfect amount of food and suck it back into the syringe if you give em too much. 

Protein has to come from dead animals/insects. I know you mentioned that you hate to see animals dead or hurt but that's kind of part of keeping ants. Ants need protein for the production of eggs and so the brood (baby ants) can grow. Without protein your colony will not get very far. I use a whole variety of foods such as crickets, fruit flies, mealworms, etc. if you can, try mixing up what you feed your ants. They really need variety in their protein intake. I would also try to stay away from feeding your ants meat. I find most ants dislike meat in general. Maybe offer it as something extra? If you want to, you can collect bugs from outside to feed your ants. Make sure they are free of pesticides and you MUST freeze them for a minimum of 30 minutes but preferably longer. Insects are great hosts for a number of damaging parasites. Freezing them for a significant amount of time will kill these parasites.

Onto our last topic, your choice of ant. I know you mentioned Lasius flavus but, as someone who is currently keeping Lasius flavus, I would not recommend them. They are very timid and easy to smush. They're a great second or third ant but not a first. Being that you live in Europe, I would really recommend Lasius niger as your first colony. They're extremely cheap and not too timid. This way, if you decide you don't like keeping ants you can cut your losses and not have an empty bank account. There is a whole plethora of reasons that Lasius niger is great for beginners but I'm not going to go into detail here. If you are not interested in Lasius niger for a particular reason let me know. I'm sure I can come up with more species.

Everyone's version and timeframe of a correction is different. There are also ""sideways corrections"" where the market doesn't necessarily go down, but it remains stagnant for a long time, effectively being a correction. Your friend timed his exit expecting a 2008 sized correction when I think there was only a 5% or so correction at the beginning of 2015.

I do think a correction is coming in the next 3-6 months. If not because of the delay or inevitability of Trump's corporate tax cuts, then because of the debt ceiling hitting 20 trillion on March 15. I think the round number of 20 will be a big psychological hurdle for congress to increase over and Trump won't help things. If not because of the debt ceiling, then because of the European elections and potential an ""Italeave"" or I think there is also talk of France leaving the Eurozone. And if not because of the European elections then because of the Euro region debt, and if not that then some other geopolitical tension. There are a ton of things that could go wrong.

P/E ratios haven't been this high since the 2008 recession, and before that, the 2001 tech bubble. I think retail investors and index funds are buying the market up. There have been a lot of cases of the market popping in the last half hour of the trading day after being flat all day. This is from the index funds and ETFs buying in close to market close in order to get a price close to the closing price in order to reduce index tracking error. Retail investors aren't going to sit on their thumbs when the market starts to pull back...they'll run for the exits.

I really like Tesla but I sold it a couple of weeks ago because it was overbought. It was run up because of optimism because of the CEO Elon Musk's relationship with Trump. When Tesla released financials, reality set in, and the stock crashed. I think the market will drop for similar reasons that Tesla did.

That said, the opposite happened to First Solar. Solar stocks crashed last year because of fear that Trump would get rid of solar panel installation tax credits. When First Solar released it's financials, reality set in and the stock jumped because things weren't as bad as they were expected to be under Trump.

I've sold all my stocks, but I'm still early on to FI (and I've already been beating the S&amp;P anyway) so I don't really have a ton to lose if one of the 45 reasons for the market to correct don't actualize.

26. “Skiing among palm trees? … For this reason I would advise no one in the Berchtesgadener Land to invest in a ski-lift. The probability of earning money with the global warming is getting less and less.”
Hartmut Graßl, Director Emeritus,
Max Planck-Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, page 3, 4 Mar 2006

****

27. “Climate warming leads to an increasingly higher snow line. The number of future ski resorts that can be expected to have snow is reducing. […] Climate change does not only lead to higher temperatures, but also to changes in the precipitation ratios in summer and winter. […] In the wintertime more precipitation is to be anticipated. However, it will fall more often as rain, and less often as snow, in the future.”
Hans Elsasser, Director of the Geographical Institute of the University of Zurich, 4 Mar 2006

 **comment content**: This probably means two things, one is that American shipping is to some degree left alone by the u-boats and that Germany doesn't attempt to drag Mexico into the war.

The determining factor here is the Russian exit.  It was complete early in 1918, and this freed up a million German troops from the Russian front to come west.  Historically, this was about the time that American troops entered the fight.  None of the combatants on the western front were at the top of their game given 4 years of losses, but a million men is still a million men.  Germany had them (but not a deep pool of replacements by then), and France and Britain did not.

If Germany can make good on their spring 1918 offensive, they win.  It's probably not a crushing victory, but either the French army is functionally exhausted or Paris is taken or both.

The consequences for France, Britain, and Belgium are a loss of colonial territory but probably something close to status quo in Europe.  However, the consequences of the German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman empires existing postwar are significant.  Additionally, this almost certainly means that the USSR is strangled in its cradle and Russia either becomes an elected republic or a constitutional monarchy.

Should the German offensive of 1918 fail, it's almost certain that the Germans will stand on the defensive against a sizable new batch of British tanks in 1919 and lose.  The British had access to American munitions and other industrial imports, and were able to build tanks in significant quantity where Germany could not, and it would have to be industry that established a final leverage where manpower was largely depleted.

t1_dechqdp,10,,0,harminda,0,1488348679,False,HistoryWhatIf,False,,1491108221,"&gt; Hmm. I suppose at the point you can put a satellite on the orbit you will discover all major land masses you didn't know about. Can we delay the discovery of the Americas that far?

Something to consider here- the march of technological advancement in Eurasia will be much, much slower than our timeline if the Americas are never discovered. Our world's technological level has its foundations in the 500+ year economic supremacy of Europe, which was only made possible due to the pillage of the New World's vast resources. 

Without the New World, Spain, Portugal, or England can never hope to become the world powers that they did- nor would the world be affected by the United States (which can obviously never exist in this scenario) So in this sense, it's conceivable that technological levels in 2017 might even be similar to the 17 or 1800s. I very much doubt there would have been anything close to an Industrial Revolution.

China, over this period, was technologically stagnant even as Europe explored and conquered the world. There is no reason to believe this would change, so there's little hope in thinking they'll invent satellites or computers or gas engines or anything of the sort. Europe, without the New World, will remain what it always had been- a backwater region far from the main developments of the world.

Anyway. On to the meat of the question. Assuming the Americas are never discovered, what does the course of their history to 2017 look like? First off- the Nahua Triple Alliance (Aztec Empire) is likely to fall even without Spanish influence. People overestimate Cortes' forces- it's true that he only had a few hundred men, but he only had 12 guns. The most important factor in his overthrow of Tenochtitlan was the 80,000+ native auxilliaries that joined him. These peoples will likely rise up at some point regardless- their grievances against Tenochtitlan were many.

The Tawantinsuyu (Inca Empire) is likely to survive a long while. They had a strong state, a powerful military, and no real competition locally. I forsee them, at some point, establishing at least a cursory maritime presence and establishing trade with Mexico- whatever state solidifies there after the collapse of the Triple Alliance. 

In any case, I doubt either civilization is going to advance much over the next 500 years. The main issue is they simply do not have the resources to trade goods on a large scale over great distances- for this requires both wheels and pack animals. Because of this, their economic capacity is limited. 

Llamas and alpacas are their only hope, and I don't know enough about the animals to speculate whether they could adapt. They will be very poor substitutes for horses and mules in any case- I don't believe they can be ridden effectively.

As for the rest of North America, it's harder to speculate. The Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) had a lot of good ideas about government, but at the end of the day they were a Neolithic people with no metallurgy. Certainly they could potentially enter the Bronze Age perhaps absent European influence, but how far that gets them, I'm not sure.

**TL;DR:** I'd guess that, if the Americas were left untouched until 2017, they probably would not be much different than they were in 1492. I think even the technological and political advancement of Europe from 500 BC to 1 AD would probably be a period of much more drastic change. ",t5_35koa,,decw4ew,t3_5wr3ly,

A european military can be pushed, but not via the EU. It needs to be bilateral between participating countries, most likely Benelux, France, Germany and maybe Denmark and Sweden. If these can pilot project the whole thing without impacting the rest of the EU, interested parties can follow suit and when a threshold is reached, it can be made mandatory via EU. Everything else is damaging the EU.

All 3 have a good build, had jet black hair growing up, but the other two brothers had more olive skin and my granddad had fairer skin and those wolf blue eyes. I'm also mixed with a shit ton of European genetics. I know a good chunk is French, and I have to assume there's some type of Romanian something or another in me because if I try to pull some Princess Leia hair I look like some fat Romanian housewife that needs to hang the laundry on the line and call hubby Boris in for supper.

I'm thankful for the eyes, they are pretty awesome, and my daughter's eyes are even more piercing. They look like ice. My son got a bit more of his daddy's genetics so there's a fierce battle being waged within him since his birth, between my redhead genes and the misters Italian/Native American/Polish genes. Some days I have a paler skinned, redheaded-ish, blue-ish eyed baby, and other days he's an olive skinned, darker haired, darker eyed baby.

Speaking of Desert Storm, The single air frame which accounted for the most loses on the US side was the A-10. And that was using 30 year old SAM's. The A-10 is a deathtrap against any foe who has manpads or any sort of air defense. But beyond that the A-10 air frames themselves are just worn out. They need to be replaced. 

But given sequestration and limited resources the DoD has much bigger problems. 2/3rds of US naval fleet of hornets are inoperable. They desperately need to be replaced by the F-35.

Meanwhile the future no longer appears to be limited to just religious extremists armed with AK's. Russia annexed land in Europe and has been modernizing. China has been placing SAM's in the middle of the world's more traversed Shipping lane. Optimizing per hour flown isn't helpful when the platform itself is worthless against serious adversaries.

As he was originally from Europe, he said when he first came to the U.S. to work, it was like a ""learning curve"" for him in terms of the racism involved in the porn industry, because it wasn't like in Europe where they cared less and only cared if he had a big enough dick and could perform. When he first came to the U.S., he was often presented with extremely stereotypical roles, like nerdy Asian loser, and after the initial shock, he would often have to just walk out and refuse to perform until the producers/writers took out the stereotypical aspects. It's amusing in a way to describe a porn star as such, but he definitely seemed to have a lot of integrity and unwillingness to back down in that regard and he came off as a very intelligent, confident (but not cocky), and overall chill guy in the interview.

The whole purpose of a carrier is to be a presence, akin to an air base, anywhere it is needed. Not arguing for or against America's strategy and global use of this tactic, but don't confuse purpose. 

Worth noting, no NATO power can stage an air war more than 500 miles from it's shores except if the US is involved. They don't have even the refueling tanker fleet to do it. All of the EU literally relies on American air power to function in the event of a coalition strike against anything. Carriers bring that force to bear, and air bases, forward deployed in host nations, make it possible to wage a campaign. 

Things they do: 

Stop wars. 

How? 

Free trade stops wars. Carriers have made open ocean travel pretty safe compared to historical dangers. They also take part in search and rescue missions, and ensure places like North Korea cannot intimidate other countries in the region with weapons unopposed. An air base in SK can be targeted by artillery. A carrier cannot be easily targeted by artillery, if at all, and would require a multi-faceted use of force to remove it from the fight due to the escorts and battle zone it demands. 

All this to say, there are advantages, but if you only view an air force / navy as being needed to defend one's own shores, then sure, an aircraft carrier serves little to no purpose. They are not designed to. They are designed to do a lot more and you are well within your right to decide the cost to do all those other things is too high, but don't keep harping on defending shores when that is not at all what they are used for.

She is a well-known advocate of open borders and often stated, that Europe has the duty to give every single one of these refugees from all over the middle east, rarely warzones, asylum and welfare. Everyone who represented a different opinion was viciously attacked by her, and she is not alone. Many other multi-millionaires and billionaires seem to be fond of virtue-signaling about refugees. Since she is a sheltered member of the rich elite, we think that it is time for her to show some true solidarity. J.K. Rowling has 18 spare bedrooms in her mansions in Britain and could easily give 18 refugees a long-time housing, not to mention the space available on her giant property to erect refugee shelters. 
&gt; 
&gt; The refugee crisis will require 250000 homes to be built every year in her homeland Britain. Helping refugees in Europe will cost 10 times as much as helping them in neighbouring countries would. Donations by the superrich, even in the millions, are a drop in the ocean, as the taxpayer will have to pay billions for the following decades. Elites, that echo the MSM narrative, defending open borders, are hypocrites that will never share the outlook of the working class, which has to encounter refugees every day. So let's bring one of the loudest virtue-signaling apologists of globalism back to reality and give her some new roommates.
&gt; 
&gt; We demand that J.K. Rowling grants no less than 18 refugees shelter in her mansions for at least 8 years. She rejects safe immigration, which is why we also demand, that there will be no additional vetting process for these refugees. Her virtue-signaling stems from ignorance, and the 100% effective cure of it will be this drastic change of perspective. To make this group of refugees representative of the situation Europe, we also demand that the group consists of 14 men and 4 women, since over 75% of the millions of refugees are male.

&gt;The legal system prepares to allow you to work leave school/work full time/enroll in higher education/pay income tax/get married/enroll in the military/etc.

You asked what magical thing happens on the evening of our 18th birthday, the legal shyster and society prepares us to vote. That's a non-answer like yours.

&gt;The people who voted to get rid of it were the people who benefited from it. That's what's unfair, and I say this as a Scottish student who had my higher education paid for by the Scottish government, and what's happening in England and Wales is an absolute travesty. It's slowly becoming closer and closer to the monumental fuck up of the US university system where all they care about is how much money they can bring in.

So you ignored my question and your only argument is that it happened in the past so should happen now. The vast majority of people who voted for tuition fees never benefitted from free university. Why shouldn't the primary beneficiary pay for it?

&gt;[A large portion of UK science funding/research came from our partnership with the EU.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/20/brexit-could-cost-uk-science-millions-in-lost-research-funding-peers-warn) Do you really think a Tory government would invest that money into science research?

Conjecture. You think we won't be involved in EU research projects still? We wont have a Tory government forever.

&gt;It will make it significantly harder. As it stands, UK nationals can go and study/work in any EU country without requiring any further visa's. This will end with us leaving the EU.

I think the negative effect of free movement outweigh the positives. So it's more difficult for one person to work / study in Europe but easier for another to get a job in the factory down the road.

&gt;My point is that they've went out and voted against something that will affect this country for decades to come, and they won't even have to experience any negative effects of it, whilst our 16/17 year olds who will bear the brunt of this weren't allowed any input on it.

It differs immensely from country to country. In Scandinavia about 90 % of the population speak english (and often quite well), that's more than in Canada. In France less than 40 % do so (and I assume on average worse than the Scandinavians) and in Spain about 20 % and in Russia only about 5 % (I assume you don't want to go to Russia though). As a rule of thumb: If the native language is small and the country rich, people are more likely to speak english because they are culturally very imersed in english culture and don't synchronise movies and stuff. Another rule of thumb is that younger people and business people are more likely to speak good english. Netherlands and Slovakia should be fine, Germany and Austria are probably worse but as you'll mostly interact with young and educated people you shouldn't have a problem as they are very unlikely to not speak halfway decent english.

&gt; where would you people recommend as a country to attend college in?

I don't really know. There are tons of different rules about colleges in the different countries and then it also differs from college to college. In Germany obviously Berlin is great but also steadily becoming more expensive. Some of the former eastern cities are quite cheap still though. I've heard that Leipzig is quite good for instance but I've never been there personally. Vienna is also a fantastic city but also rather expensive.

Again in countries with smaller languages you should be more likely to find english courses. I know Denmark has a lot of education that is completely in english for instance. In Germany I think that's less likely to find. 

&gt; So my final question is, is there a violent anti-American sentiment where you are

It's a general problem. E.g. you may know about Crash Course World History - those guys tried to make pop history show focusing on the world in general as opposed to a prevalent Eurocentric approach you get in schools. There were couple of problems with this approach: first they downplayed the things that were indeed important in Europe (7 years war/French Revolution/USA/Napoleonic stuff was world defining wherever you lived because those where world wars and birth of modern universal ideologies). Second, they tried to specifically go for exotic places. Thus you heard about interesting things like Haiti Revolution or Indian Ocean trade. But Middle East or Eastern Europe or Scandinavia or South America weren't exotic enough. So whole of Eastern Europe before 20th century gets one episode talking mostly about Russia.

And Paradox still has lots of content made for Eastern Europe. In EU4 there are special mechanics for Poland, map of Russia was reworked couple of times, new Russian principalities appeared. Nothing like flavor for Western Europe or Ottomans or even hordes though.

Liverpool FC has filed its annual accounts for the year to May 31, 2016 reporting that revenues are continuing to grow, creating further financial stability for the club.

Overall revenue increased to a record £301m and has grown year on year since Fenway Sports Group (FSG) took ownership of LFC in October 2010. Media revenue and matchday revenue increased, mainly as a result of the club reaching two cup finals and a successful pre-season tour in Asia and Australia.

Commercial revenues remained strong despite the construction of the Main Stand at Anfield impacting on access to the stadium on a non-matchday. Ten new partnerships were announced during the reporting period, including Draftkings, Vixlet, Claymore Wines and Skype; while four existing partners renewed their deals, further demonstrating the club’s global appeal. The club also launched an official LFC online store on the JD.com marketplace in China - becoming the first football club in Europe to do so.

Digitally, there was an 18 per cent increase in new followers, taking the overall total to over 50 million across the club’s social media platforms. New LFC websites were also launched in Arabic, French and Spanish.

Despite overall revenue increasing, the club reported a loss of £19.8m for the period, mainly as a result of further investment and turnover in the first-team squad. Twelve additions were made to the first team, including Roberto Firmino, James Milner, Marko Grujic, Danny Ings, Nathaniel Clyne and Joe Gomez. Young player development also continues to be an important part of the club’s football strategy, with 12 Academy players offered professional contracts.

Andy Hughes, chief operating officer at Liverpool Football Club, said: “These results demonstrate the solid financial progress that’s been made over the past six years under the leadership of FSG with continued investment in the playing squad and the completion of the main stand.

“The increase in the underlying revenue adds further strength to the club’s financial position despite the cost of football rising with player transfer fees, wages and agents’ costs.

“During this reporting period, we also agreed a new five-year credit facility, which further secures the club’s long-term financial stability.

“All three main revenue streams continue to show strength and commercial revenues held firm irrespective of the impact of the Main Stand at Anfield.”

Liverpool is the only club in the top 10 of the Deloitte Football Money League that didn’t play in the UEFA Champions League last season - demonstrating the strength of its commercial operations to support reinvestment into the playing squad.

Since the reporting period, the club has continued to grow its partnership portfolio, with Bet Victor, Malaysia Airlines, Konami and Alcatel all joining up.

Hughes added: “Since this reporting period, which is nearly a year ago, we have continued to make solid financial progress and we expect to see further growth in our revenues following the successful opening of the Main Stand and the new media deal.

“Our commercial operations continue to thrive through new partnerships, global retail growth and developing our international soccer schools, with our newest Academy opening recently in Australia.

“Being able to connect directly with supporters around the world is extremely important and a key part of our digital strategy. We continue to see more and more supporters joining our channels and we are approaching seven million followers on our global Twitter account.

“The investments from this ownership have been a key factor to our financial and global progress. We have seen continued investment in the playing squad; the expanded Main Stand; the new flagship retail store opening later this year; fully refurbished retail stores in Liverpool and Belfast; and we are consulting on a proposed development at our Academy in Kirkby to bring together the first team and our young players.

“These investments all contribute to further progress and strengthen the club’s financial position which ultimately serves to support all of our football ambitions.”

Volkoff's book does indeed seem like a Bible on the matter. I obtained it in Romanian and only after posting found just how difficult it is to track down an English translation. Maybe there isn't one.

One of the details that came into focus for me during this time was the... flexibility in outrage magnitude. In other words, how easy it is to twist things that sound criminal into a scale of your choosing, minimizing the transgressions of your side and exaggerating the consequences of the other side's actions. I trust I will find better words for this after I read Volkoff.

I'm also eagerly waiting for results from an ongoing sociological study. Maybe most will continue to sail smoothly through the convenient moral landscape laid out for them. Some, however, will have a rude awakening in store as they come to grips with the complexities of corruption.

Of course you can read Russian news for the other angle but its not trustworthy either.  (I don't read Russian news.)

Serbia also has Vojvodina pulling it up.

Kosovo is a bit like Turkish Kurdistan -- very high support for independence but low development level.  But net freedom across the two territories may still increase with independence.  That is, Serbia might be less free if it still had Kosovo, and Kosovo would most likely be even less free.

For Bosnia I see more hope, traditionally Sarajevo was a quite developed place, and its score here is more or less in line with the region, and still freer than Armenia.  Probably the score should be specific to the different entities.  Republika Srpska (the part that wants independence from independence) is less free.

(I know Serbia well, have been a few times to Croatia and Bulgaria, and to all regions (Catholic/Muslim/Orthodox) of Bosnia and Hercegovina, and speak those languages not too too badly.  And German, which is also important there.  Never been to Kosovo.)

In a parallel universe where Azerbaijan were in the Russian camp and Armenia in the NATO camp, CNN would have demonised Azerbaijan and Azeris, the CIA would have funded the Lezgin separatists, Iran would have backed a Shiite militia...  It could end up like Bosnia (still freer than Armenia) or like Iraq.

We complain that the world does not pay attention to this conflict, but often when it does pay attention to a conflict, the result is much worse, especially further from Europe and closer to the Middle East.  Armenia, Artsakh and Azerbaijan are still safe countries.  (Azerbaijan is the least safe, but it's still about as safe as the US.)",t5_3dwnu,,ded0l3s,t3_5wt2do,

Ceux-là voulaient que la russie devienne une démocratie à l'occidentale avec une orientation socialiste. 

Quand ils ont vu arriver Lénine, qui proposait de mettre en place une dictature et militait pour une guerre civile mondiale contre le capitalisme et l'extermination des bourgeois, tous les autres l'ont prit pour un gros taré.

Après le soviet en question a mis à la tete de la russie un gouvernement provisoire composé de bourgeois et de socialistes. Ce gouvernement a décidé qu'il fallait continuer la guerre mondiale parce qu'on ne pouvait pas abandonner à l'Allemagne les territoires occupés et que ce serait une trahison envers la France et l'Angleterre.

C'est seulement là que Lénine a réussi à monter une armée (avec des soldats pacifistes) et à prendre le pouvoir par la force en éliminant du soviet central tous les non bolchéviques.

À ce moment là, personne pensait que Lénine arriverait à garder le pouvoir, mais en éliminant les opposants politiques et avec son armée, il a bel et bien réussi.

That is a quantitative claim that can be proven or disproven, so please provide that citation. In particular where the inflection point lies, because if it lies higher than large European countries it's a strong argument for smaller countries to have a joint currency.

&gt;It's different because two cities in the same country have one single political and fiscal union. But two countries in the euro have different political and fiscal unions. The problem is when you have a single currency but multiple political and fiscal factions.

I don't think so. There were and are plenty of federal countries that had their regions enact different economic policies. Apparently having their own policies and their own budgets did not cause problems. In fact, it generally increases their ability to deal with asymmetric shocks that affect them but not other parts of the country.

We Hungarians (just like Serbs, Romanians, Slovaks etc.) were conquered by the Mongols 750 years ago who destroyed 60-70% of our whole population. Then came the Turks for another 150 years, destroying our towns and villages, kidnapping our youth to brainwash them and use them as fanatic soldiers against their own nation as yanissars. Then came the Habsburg occupation against which we fought two bloody independence wars. The Nazis exterminated 400,000 of us. And I won't tell you about the horrors of the Communist occupation by half-Asian barbarians, but trust me, you would've rather been a Native American in the US than an average Hungarian farmer during the Soviet occupation in the 1950s.

Every small nation was conquered, oppressed some time in history, often on the brink of extinction. But whenever I read comments from Native Americans here, they are always whining about things that happened 500 years ago while blaming all the white people from the Ukrainians to the Basques.

I'm not confident anymore that Labour can hold onto their seats anymore and Corbyn seems to be the least concerned; just like he was before the brexit vote.  This half hearted fence sitting stance he takes is going to cost the country.  My worst fear is that this will only be totally apparent when its too late and UKIP will step in to polarise the situation and run a campaign on bigotry.

In short Corbyn has to either step down or actually take a stance and challenge the Tories.

""...centred around the minority Finnic-Ugric language of Quenya created by J.R.R. Tolkien...""

Nope! It's neither a minority language nor part of the ""Finnic-Ugric""-language family (It's supposed to be Finno-Ugric...) There are incredibly few cognates with the Finno-Ugric languages in Quenya, and the grammar seems more inspired by Indo-European languages like Classical Latin and Classical Greek. Also a conlang can never be part of a real-life language-family since it was created and did not descend from a proto-language (like Finno-Ugric). Quenya is on the other hand in the Oromëan language-family alongside other Elvish languages like Sindarin.

""Tolkien based Quenya grammatically and aesthetically on the Finnish language...""

While it is true that Tolkien had a great love and passion for the Finnish language and that it served as an early inspiration for Quenya, the actual influence on Quenya is actually quite small. As I previously stated, the grammar of Quenya is more akin to that of Indo-European, conjugating verbs, nouns and adjectives in much the same way. Some of the cases however such as the locative, allative and ablative are probably inspired by Finnish. When it comes to the ""aesthetics"" inspired by Finnish one can easily see that the phonology doesn't seem to match Finnish, with a vowel system more reminiscent of say Italian. Together with consonants such as: mb, nkw, ngw and hw, which are uncommon or don't exist in Finnish. So the only real aesthetics inspired from Finnish are ""ë"", which is just a normal e and not a Finnish ë, and the endings ""ainen"" and ""oinen"".

""... it seems that our translation department didn't realise the Suomi name for E.L.V. was in fact Gnome and not Elf. Please note Quenya is not a Gnomish language, I don't even know what Gnomes would speak."" 

Calling it a Gnomish language, or just Gnomish is actually not that wrong seeing as Gnomish was the original name Tolkien devised for Quenya. While Elvish is preferable I can't see any reason while Gnomish would be that wrong, other than that Tolkien decided to change the name.

Sorry if I seem angry, but I just don't like it when people can't be bothered to fact check simple things like this (or even twist the facts for that matter). Also when they have a name such as ""Elvish Liberation Front"" it's quite hard to take them seriously, which actually makes this seem like a group of deranged extremists or something.

 **comment content**: Napoleon's Waterloo - 2002 - Bill Lyons

Napoleon's dreams of enduring empire were finally extinguished in a muddy field in Belgium, an anonymous piece of farmland that we now call Waterloo. This documentary analyzes the significance of Waterloo in the context of Napoleon's life, his personality, his political career, and his military capacity. It clarifies the facts and the forces that led to the great confrontation between Napoleon and Wellington on Sunday, June 18th, 1815, in the battle that engaged 200,000 combatants in an area less than two miles square, and left 50,000 dead or dying.

Napoleon Bonaparte - PBS 4 part series
Destiny

Episode I recounts the story of Napoleon's extraordinary rise from Corsican obscurity to the victories in Italy that made him a hero to the French people and convinced him that he was destined for greatness. It also tells of his love for Josephine Beauharnais, a woman of extravagant habits and tastes, who did not at first return his passionate affection.

Mastering Luck

Episode II charts Napoleon's ascent to absolute power, from victorious General to first Consul to Emperor of France. It describes his extraordinary achievements – from the Napoleonic Code and the Bank of France, to bridges, roads, and canals – as well as the tyrannical nature of his rule and the violent opposition of most of Europe.


The Summit of Ambition

Episode III witnesses Napoleon conquer most of Europe in a series of brilliant triumphs, including his legendary victory at the Battle of Austerlitz. To sustain his rule, he must keep fighting. But when he invades Spain, he has begun to reach too far.


The End

Episode IV describes Napoleon's downfall, including the invasion and subsequent retreat from Russia, and his final battles, in which all of Europe is arrayed against him. Exiled to Elba, he returns to France after just ten months, only to be defeated for the last time at Waterloo. Napoleon spends his final days exiled on an island far out in the Atlantic, where he writes his memoirs and reinvents his legend.

TTC - Living the French Revolution and the Age of Napoleon [48 WebRips
The 25 years between the onset of the French Revolution in 1789 and the Bourbon Restoration after Napoleon in 1814 is an astonishing period in world history. This era shook the foundations of the old world and marked a
permanent shift for politics, religion, and society—not just for France, but for all of Europe. An account of the events alone reads like something out of a thrilling novel:

France’s oppressed and hungry masses rise up against their government.
In Paris, crowds storm the Bastille looking for bread and weaponry.
Rumors, panic, and fear grip the nation as it faces an uncertain future.
The National Assembly adopts the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the first bold step toward the invention of democratic politics and a republican state.
King Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette try to flee the country under cover of darkness.
After the king’s execution, the government takes emergency measures that lead to the Terror, when thousands will be put to death by the guillotine.
A young Corsican named Napoleon Bonaparte stuns Europe with his military strategy and political boldness.
At the end of his empire, Napoleon escapes Elba to confront the Duke of Wellington at the famous Battle of Waterloo.

Living the French Revolution and the Age of Napoleon is your opportunity to learn the full story of this captivating period. Taught by Dr. Suzanne M. Desan, a distinguished professor of history at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, these 48 exciting lectures give you a broad and comprehensive survey of one of the most important eras in modern history.

What makes this course such a rare treat is that Professor Desan introduces you to all sides of the story. A people’s revolution for liberty and equality is an exciting moment in history, and indeed the crowds that rose up against the Old Regime were infused with optimism. Yet there is a darker side of the story as well:

The tyranny of Robespierre and his ardent support of the Terror
Revolutionary tribunals and the Committee of Public Safety, which were meant to maintain the peace but which exacerbated the fear
The tens of thousands who were executed, many without trial

1) A large enough market in terms of population and wealth to have had about every non-indie game released in the EU localised in our language for the last 25 years (which can be said of French and German, and to some extent Spanish, Italian and Dutch). Same goes for video game press, Youtubers, etc. Even as a voracious internet user, you can basically ignore that something like reddit exists, stick within the French sphere for your whole life and all the newsworthy stuff will get relayed to your local outlets and communities within a day. But if you live in the Scandinavian region or the Slavic one, well learning English is your only option.  
2) A shit school system when it comes to foreign languages. That's more French-specific.  
3) Historically, French and English have been the languages of diplomacy. You can see early reports of the UN still being written in both languages. At some point, English (more specifically, the U.S.) won the cultural language war for two reasons: they wiped WW2 debts in exchange of letting their cinema and music in our countries with bascially zero roadblock ; and most computer languages were written in English, leading to computing and the early internet being English. We collectively acknowledged it way too late.

I'm now starting to learn a bit more about the economy but I still have some troubles considering JC.

On my realm, all the gem prices are fairly low (Mastery being at around 700g cut and the others even lower) except for Dawnlight (haste). The uncut have always been around 1k-1.1k and the cut between 1.3k-1.5k.

There was a JC World Quest which awarded a free yellow (haste) gem in Dalaran, which I think might have caused the market to destabilize for a while. Prices dropped to 850g/each uncut and 1k/each cut. So I thought I would buy a good amount (100 uncut) while still having a good amount of gold to spare in case things went bad. Prices kept dropping for the uncut (until 750g/each) but then just popped up, back to 1k each. However, the cut version was only 50g(!) more than the uncut version.

A few books fell and he uttered a vague 'Sorry', he could tell if those deep translucent hazel eyes shifted even a bit, and they moved all the way under a facade of denial.     

'What a dweeb' He could hear the snickers from the football playing jocks, as if they were shouted into his ears.    

He was getting late for history class, and Professor Arkmore would not tolerate his latecoming anymore. He had yet to make friends, that could change his college life from that of total misery in denial, to a more normal experience. 

The air was cool, and the sun didn't burn all that much in the crowded corridors where scheming noises echoed. His mother taught him how to live with it, to bear the sharp prick of sunlight on his skin, like tolerating a burning scab until it hardened and turned numb to further pain.      

He halted in front of the door with a glass window, and stood staring through it before finally pushing himself in. More snickers, Arkmore was in the midst of his class and completely ignored the intrusion while leaning stoically over the blackboard.   

""The gilded age and the influence of settlers"" was written in chalk, straight lines, not even the slightest curve.       

'So as i was saying America would not have been anything without the hardworking immigrants who shaped most of the industrial revolution later on, however there were settlers from parts of Europe where the after effects of the French Revolution were being enjoyed, or rather suffered depending on the perspective'  Arkmore announced, his thick glasses seemed out of place on his pale oval face, hair neatly parted gleamed with strays of white.      

Valar awkwardly climbed up the aisle of steps in between long rows of benches, and found a place to settle himself in, the third row from below that happened to be sparsely populated.       

'Settlers who desperately stood in lines for work, but there was a sect of people who were considered as lazy and crowding the streets, commonplace in those times i must say, but these people were mostly dedicated towards working tables at night, doing graveyard shifts, who contributed towards arson and thievery, that sort of thing' He took out his glasses to wipe his wrinkled tired eyes, and continued 'You may know them from movies and soap opera, but people kept an eye out for those whom they suspected would bring in the famine'     

Valar puffed hard, unwittingly and unknowingly, few eyes bore into him.     

'Why Mr Valiant.....anything to add ?'   

'Err.. its actually Valar' he replied.

'Valar from the north' one of the backbenchers uttered.     

'That's actually not true, the settlers from Europe were the driving hands behind most of the industrial revolution, you taught us that' he stood and waved his hands.      

'Well, correct me if i'm wrong, but i did use the word Sect' Arkmore replied.    

 'Sir, they may have felt lost finding their way in a new place, we found it difficult too when me and my mom moved into this city five years ago' The mocking whispers were getting hard to bear.      

'I do not debate the trials and tribulations of immigrants into this great country, but this is a history class Valar, and i expect you to take note of the established truths of what has already passed'      

'Vampires, that's the word you want right, you call us that' laughter turned into confusion and bewilderment.      

'Hope you dont take this class as a joke Mr Valar'     

'This isn't a joke professor, but i want to make it clear that our kind were not thieves or beggars like you make them out to be, but were Aristocrats and Industrialists, we pretty much shaped the era' Valar smiled confidently, his long brown hair covering most of his spotted pink cheeks.       

'Hey man, go practice your shitty impov skills someplace else' Jeered someone from behind.      

'Well, there were some great impov artists too, i know uncle Mackel used to perform at the building that's now the cultural centre, but that was way into the late eighties' replied Valar, surprised at the sudden burst of confidence that shot through him while facing all the cynicism.    

'Well then, if thats the whole case, then we ought to be controlled by the secret CIA vampire government' Some other guy took his shot from the bench to his left, and the students burst into a loud guffaw, 'Your whole family should've had some kinda shitty crossover with Warewolves' more roars of laughter      

Valar felt the swoop of molten lava pour into the centre of his chest and ripped the buttons of his checked shirt around his hardened pecs, and then proceeded to get on top of the desk. The laughter died out.    

'Maybe you should've taken us more seriously' he looked at everyone in the wide hall, fangs protruding from his mouth. The girls rows behind held tight to their desks, sweat trickled over their nimble necks and something told him it was more desire than fear. The guys stood up too, and that was certainly fear.          

'I will not fall for this prank, get down now or face the risk of being expelled' spoke Arkmore not shifting his stance.   

Valar complied and jumped over two rows of tables to land in front of the professor. Arkmore stood dumbfounded and that made Valar grimace in satisfaction.       

He barged towards the doors and banged it shut behind him. The corridors were cool as ever, like nothing ever happened, maybe he would be seeing them for the last time.

Be patient, first of all.

Next step: buy an old gods pack, that will guarantee you C'Thun. That lets you make a decent basic or budget C'Thun mage deck (or other classes), which will let you play and earn gold. This one for example: http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/503285-budget-cthun

Next step: always roll your 40g quests. The average quest gold is 53, so even 50g ones can be rolled if you have two other that are 60 or higher. If you get a quest that requires you to win with a class other than mage you can look up a decent basic/budget deck for it and play it in casual. ""Play x cards"" quests are obviously the easiest ones. Or just make a deck with your C'Thun for that class as well.

Next: Don't trash your whole collection just for one meta deck. If you know cards are actually shit it is ok to dust them, but other than that don't. Just buy classic packs until your classic collection is decent and make do with what you have. You'll get most commons and rares from packs anyways, so don't craft those either.

Next: If your classic collection has reached an ok size you can start looking at either buying packs from the newest expansion, unlocking adventures or playing arena.

Adventure upside: you know what you get and can unlock an adventure every like 2 weeks if you play efficiently.

Arena upside: at 3 wins you already get what you pay for. At 4 you have a small net gain. So if you can average at least 4 wins you will have a constant small net gain over time. If you average higher you can potentially play it infinitely to get unlimited packs. 7 wins guarantee your gold back in a single reward.

New packs upside: They often contain the strongest, meta-defining cards besides adventures. If you are not confident in your arena plays or simply haven't studied it enough yet, it may be wiser to just buy packs for now. Adventures&gt;packs overall.

If you have any more questions ask away or feel free to add Nynth#2606 on EU or NA and ask ingame.

&gt; * BRUSSELS -- European Union officials and lawmakers are set to sign documents formalizing a visa-liberalization deal for the former Soviet republic of Georgia on March 1.

&gt; * Diplomats familiar with the issue told RFE/RL that the documents will be published in the official EU journal on March 8 and will enter into force 20 days later, enabling Georgians to travel visa-free to the EU as of March 28.

&gt; * Officials and diplomats are also set to sign a document on a visa-suspension mechanism that has been drafted as a condition for the implementation of visa-liberalization agreements for non-EU countries.

&gt; * The visa-liberalization deal will apply to all EU countries except Britain and Ireland, and also to non-EU Schengen Area countries Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland.

One of my ancestors happens to have been King Edward II, who was also descended from King John (as they were), who was in turn descended from the emperor Charlemagne, who studies have shown is a common ancestor to upwards of 80% of those with European ancestry. 

Quite frankly, it would be surprising to find that they were *not* somehow related, if one delves back far enough into their genealogy, as historians tend to do in earnest considering the individuals they were researching were Presidents, thus a common ancestor is found more often than it would for the average person (of European descent) who more often than not would also share a common ancestry with them as well, if they had the time and resources to research their genealogy as extensively as those who research that of our presidents have had. Of course, it's entirely possible this could be more than coincidental, and that those chosen for the Presidency of the United States are selected in part due to their genetics, however that would be entirely hypothetical, with zero proof or evidence beyond the aforementioned and overall expected series of coincidences to support such a theory.

&gt;* A man and woman compete in a backgammon championship organised by Double Yerushalmi, a group trying to build closer ties between Arabs and Jews through cultural activities, in Jerusalem February 27, 2017.

&gt;* The gathering is the latest in a series of events organized by Double Yerushalmi, a group trying to build closer ties between Arabs and Jews through cultural activities like singing, dancing and the increasingly popular shesh besh championship.

&gt;* To the strains of Arabic Dabke music - not usually heard in the western, mainly Jewish side of Jerusalem - around 50 players turned up on Monday, sitting hunched over the backgammon tables, shaking dice and clicking the counters like pros.

&gt;* With a history that some trace back 5,000 years to the ancient Iraqi city of Ur, backgammon is a mainstay in the Middle East, the clatter of the counters ringing out in the souks of Cairo, Istanbul, Casablanca and Damascus for centuries.

&gt;* Jerusalem has also long been a center for the game and Djemal is hoping to reinforce that by organizing a Mediterranean championship later this year, with players coming from Morocco, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and across Europe.

I said that

And this came as a response to someone who was claiming that it takes little evidence for a spy to get caught. Factual evidence is require for a spy to be caught and prosecuted.

And Israel has the lowest of them all. But that is far from a valid proof. Europe might have better sex ed than the US. I'm not saying circumcision prevents infection, it's just lowered.

&gt; This was based on quack research from 50 years ago. The American Cancer Society does not endorse circumcision as a preventative measure. https://www.cancer.org/cancer/penile-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/prevention.html

quack research? even your source clearly states that HPV causes cancer.

But I also never said it should be used as a preventative measure.
circumcision reduces risk of infection from HIV and other STIs and for HPV specifically, here a meta study:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21415373

&gt; The unkeratinized epithelium of the inner human foreskin is thought to be more susceptible to human papillomavirus (HPV) entry than the rest of the penis. However, studies exploring a potential association between male circumcision and HPV infection have produced conflicting results. The present review stratifies the evidence based on methods of sampling and detection of HPV infection, HPV type, and the stage of infection. This approach reveals that circumcision reduces the risk of HPV infection in a stage- and type-specific manner. There is no consistent association of HPV acquisition with circumcision status, indicating that circumcised men may be no more protected from initial HPV infection than their uncircumcised peers. Circumcision is not protective against nononcogenic types of HPV, but is associated with a reduced prevalence and persistence of oncogenic HPV infections. Circumcised men are also less susceptible to multiple infections. These findings indicate that circumcision modulates HPV persistence rather than acquisition. Through promoting HPV infection clearance, male circumcision could be an important adjunct to education, condom use, and vaccination in reducing the global burden of HPV morbidity and mortality.

I would not say they are ""bigger"" than Chelsea at all too. Financially maybe, I don't know. There aren't many players that grow up and dream of playing in Ligue 1, but I'd say most would love a chance in the EPL. This is why you see fairly good players at the likes of Southampton, Middlesbrough, Swansea and so on.  It's money yes, but also playing in the premier league that players want.   Another factor is Conte being previous Italy coach and knowing him well, and David Luiz seems to get on with him really well.   

None of that means he will move or even if he did it doesn't mean he will move to Chelsea.  However to say Chelsea can't sign superstars or high quality players isn't entirely true.  Chelsea have been one of the best English clubs if not the best in Europe in recent years.  One of the only ones to stand up to the European big boys.  One of the only clubs (other being United) that the big boys want to avoid drawing in CL.

Mechanism of affinity to GABA receptors, binding to different area's than other brands, but imo estazolam is little bit of anxiolitic too.

&gt;Is it a knock out drug?

Depends on your tolerance. For beginner 2 mg can be knocking out, for veteran of xannies, clons, diazepam imo nope. If you survive ""sleeping stage"" you feel recreational effect similar to lorazepam.

&gt;Just curious to why its manufactured if most bnzs help with this or z drugs

Free market :P In some cases lot of ppl don't need as potent drugs as zolpidem in case of sleep promotion, in some countries z-drugs are banned, lot of ppl are just addicted to consume one benzo and they manufacture them for them (:P), sometimes you patient need sth stronger than temazepam, but lighter than rohypnol. Sometimes doctors have ""their own point of view"". As I know when esta appeared in drugstores, z-drugs was in early beta stage and researches. In general, idea of putting estazolam on the market was as I mentioned below ""give ppl better nitrazepam"". I was talking about it with my DOC long time ago, DOC remember times when it appeared on the market and protips from specialist literature. In Cental EU its new benzo: appeared in ~2004 .

&gt;Ever any daytime use? Would you know duration of action, not bio half life. Were you taking daily?

Imo ~15 hours, but at lower doses and without stims like nicotine it was sleepy benzos. In higher doses it was recreational but I remember situations when I wake up after night and I ""feel"" it in my mind until ~2  PM. I used this benzo for recreational purposes too, especially when no access to another benzos. Imo game not worth of candle, I was addicted to this benzo because ""no sleep if no 3 pills under my tongue"". But it's possible to have fun with this benzo.

&gt;Thanks. Valuable info from actual user.

Look, I'm a left wing voter; I wanted us to remain in the EU. But the amount of denial and delusion in comments of this nature is *staggering*. 

The Lib Dems *knew* they couldn't get this amendment passed, because if it did, it would be effectively nullifying the Referendum result. Despite what UKIP claimed at the time, or the pro-EU have claimed since, you *cannot* have both Brexit and access to the Single Market; The EU has stated time and time again you can't cherry pick from it's [Four Freedoms.](http://www.europeanpolicy.org/en/european-policies/single-market.html), if you don't accept free movement of people, you can't have free movement of goods and capital either... which means effectively no Single Market access.

The problem for the Tories is that immigration is the main issue driving the UKIP / Tory Euroskeptic wing. If it comes down to abandoning immigration controls, or abandoning the single market, they'll abandon the market. Because that allows them to further gut the State under the excuse of now having no money. And if they don't, the UK risks lurching towards social disorder, or the rise of a UKIP led Trump like extreme Right leader who is even more focused on the bug bear of immigration.

The problem for the Labour Party is that they can't claim to the for the working class, when so many of them voted for Brexit (even if for misguided reasons). They also can't just dismiss a Referendum without also risking destroying the sense that they can possibly offer a democratic alternative; if you think the Lib Dems collapse for shucking up with the Tories and ignoring their own pledges on Student funding was bad, imagine trying to just dismiss a direct Referendum. What would be the *point* of Democracy in people's eyes when you treat it as merely ""advisory""?

*And neither changes the fact that you still have to negotiate with Europe.*  And they're in no mood to allow the European Project to be destroyed by allowing a country which has whinged and moaned and been given special conditions for decades and has now flounced out in a sulk to break the entire point of Unification... They want us out, fast, and with a clean as break as possible. 

The Lib Dems of course, previously being decimated and thus largely irrelevant, and the Blairite wing of the Labour Party trying to pull down the twice democratically elected Corbyn can cause mischief now and claim to be defending principle on Europe... but even if they'd won the amendment in the Lords, or ousted Corbyn, it won't change the facts; the majority of the country wants some sort of Brexit, and Europe is going to insist if that's the case, it has to be a hard Brexit.

So like it or not, we have to consider navigating through the best of absolutely terrible options. It means accepting that yes, the vote was stupid, self destructive, and means years of disastrous politics for this country... 

But if you want to see genuine Populist Authoritarianism in the shape of our own home grown Trump-like, continue to ignore the mood of the electorate, and deny them any sense of democratic engagement. And that thought revolts me too; But most of you don't seem to understand that is where our politics are going right now. This is so much bigger now than your personal feelings; we're dealing with what could be effectively the death-throes of the democratic principle itself. And some of you seem to be welcoming that! And seem to think you can just throw democracy out of the window entirely, and we should have some sort of Plato-esque Enlightened Monarchs ruling us. 

When democracy collapses though, history shows us it's not the enlightened that rise to the top. What we'll get instead are bigoted, unenlightened Despots. The decent people don't tend to take to the streets and fight directly for their rights and values, but the thugs and fascists do. Ours will be purple tinged, rather than orange though.

I mean, they're these little countries with little influence and yet we sent a bunch of guys over to get killed and maimed, for what?

Korea and Vietnam were basically front wars against the USSR. After WW2, the world was basically divided into the US and our allies, the USSR, and the remaining territory that wasn't yet completely under the umbrella of either side (this is where the term 3rd world originally came from, though it's morphed in meaning since then). You have to remember that global communism was seen by most (or at least many) as great as a threat to the western way of life as Nazism. You can make a case that Stalin was worse than Hitler. He did kill more people.

The USSR was expanding. Russia didn't ""own"" the territory in eastern europe, but after WW2, the red army didn't leave. And then china fell into control of the communist party. Imagine the most hyperbolic version of what people are saying about Putin right now in Russia. This was worse than that. Ukraine, the crimea. Those places were held by the USSR. They were explicitly opposed to the American way of life. Think of if ISIS if it basically controlled the entire middle east, and you're getting closer to the scale of what we're talking about.

So people were looking at a globe and saw more and more of it going red. Sometimes explicitly being annexed by the USSR, but other times they were just helping the local communists and stirring up dissent in those governments. In Korea, the deomocratic government was being under attack by communist revolutionaries. The important political question for western politicians was what to do? You can't just keep giving ground. But you also can't just start another war. We dropped atomic weapons on Hiroshima just 5 years earlier. People were still shellshocked from WW2. The next war was going to be a nuclear war, and nobody wanted that, USSR included. 

So the public justifications for war got really weird. We basically stopped admitting that we were in wars, because if we were in wars, then why aren't we using the most powerful weapons we have? And if we do that, then the USSR will return in kind, and boom, now we live in Fallout.",t5_2w2s8,,ded7jzp,t3_5wuxxl,

China had switched sides 4 years previously after invading Taiwan, a Japanese holdout. There are claims that Russia was involved, but this is disputed by many historians. After the end of the war, much of Europe and North America was controlled by Nato. Although, it's origins are obscure, most believe it to be a continuation  of preceding European cultures. Contemporary sources describe the Natoan's alliance with America, due to increasing Russian power. Nuclear power was developed during the mid 20th century, and was associated with a nuclear cult, which involved sacrificing warships in the Pacific. This practice spread to Russia, which performed similar sacrifices on arctic islands. Although allied with the Natoans, the Americans generally kept the cult to themselves, promising the natoans spiritual protection under a ""nuclear umbrella"" in exchange for the recognition of the spiritual monopoly by America. After the invention of the internet by Alan Turing, a prominent Natoan researcher, communication became much easier. This allowed technology and commerce to advance more quickly, and also political movements to build rapidly. The first American generation to have no memory of the world war was uneasy about taking part of a new one in southeast Asia, which was launched trying to keep decolonized areas from turning communist. (this was several centuries before post-scarcity) There was a wave of revolutions across the world in 1968ce, resulting in communal violence at many levels of society. An uprising in Prague is thought to have thrown the Russians out, as a few years later an American leader (Ford) is recorded as saying that there is no Soviet domination of Europe during a Ford administration. Similar upheavals happened in France, Mexico, and America, where widespread civil unrest caused the abandonment of the war and the suppression of the nuclear cult, as evidence for the sacrificial explosions disappears around this time. With the exit of the Russians, the eastern Germans took matters into their own hands. They built a wall between themselves and western Germany, under Natoan control. Berlin appears to have been a holdout and was also surrounded by a wall to keep them in their city. ",t5_2wo26,,ded7lgk,t3_5wvc01,

&gt; When cold sweat slowly trickles down your spine, goosebumps crawl over your skin and your heart skips a beat as fear grips your throat in a firm chokehold then you have entered the realm of horror. CARACH ANGREN set out to claim the throne of this dark domain with their fourth full-length 'This Is No Fairytale'. These Dutch masters of horror metal have honed their weapons to sharp perfection. Flamboyant orchestral madness contrasts eerily with the icy buzzing of black metal inspired riffs coalescing into haunting melodies. Fiercely rasping vocals and the mercilessly rattling drums whip a terror-filled storyline forward into the waiting darkness. CARACH ANGREN once again step into an even more sinister dimension than before and even surpass the war-ridden nightmares portrayed on previous album 'Where The Corpses Sink Forever'. The evil visitations began in the year 2004 with paranormal cases recorded on the demo 'The Chase Vault Tragedy'. Soon after the ‘Ethereal Veiled Existence’ EP (2005) gave a prelude to the full blown haunting at 'Lammendam' (2008), which was followed by a stormy journey onboard a cruel ghost vessel entitled 'Death Came Through A Phantom Ship' (2010). With each release CARACH ANGREN developed their unique baroque and unashamedly theatric style, which perfectly fits the cinematic horror concepts of the Dutch. Their eccentric and capturing live performances quickly gained them a large following in Europe with the US catching up in the wake of the release of 'Where The Corpses Sink Forever' in 2012. Now CARACH ANGREN are ready to unleash the demons again in a dark tale of devilish witchcraft: 'This Is No Fairytale' is bound to put a spell on you and will continue to haunt your stereo for a long time to come.

t1_ded6jgz,1,,0,HI_London,0,1488377154,False,news,False,,1491113973,"&gt; has a murder rate similar to the EU

&gt; our average is only about 4x the EU standard

I don't think you know what similar means. If I'm 4 times more likely to get murdered in your country, that's not good.

&gt; If everyone in society was armed, there would be no easy prey

So your system can only work if every single individual is armed at all times. Which is impossible to enforce. Therefore you admit that your system doesn't work.

&gt; This accident could just have easily been avoided by the teen not breaking into the house.

Teenagers sneaking into each other's home has always happened and is even somewhat part of your cultural understanding of love since it's present in every single American movie or TV show featuring teenage lovers. Even I've done it. You can explain the legality all you want, it's a ""crime"" as common as speeding, and just like for speeding the answer is not murder.

&gt; That is pure assumption on your part

It's not an assumption that theft is more common than murder or rape.

&gt; Security systems can fail

Then use your dog. Or a few tin cans on a string that will make noise. Any kind of alarm sound will deter a thief. 

&gt; Why not? We ""arm"" ourselves against potential risks all the time

This I agree with, and it's exactly why I'm arguing against widespread gun ownership. I believe it causes more harm (like here) than it gives protection. Gun control is the protection against unnecessary harm.

&gt; Actually, we can do something about situations like this, something very simple: don't break the law, as in, DON""T BREAK INTO PEOPLE'S HOUSES. If the kid hadn't put himself (and the homeowner) in this situation, there would have been no issue whatsoever.

&gt; A European Parliament committee found on Tuesday that the &amp;quot;Dieselgate&amp;quot; scandal that engulfed Volkswagen last year was not only the fault of the German automaker, but was in fact the result of a complete lack of oversight on the part of the European Union itself and the governments of several member nations in particular.

That being said, I think you raise a valid point. Ultimaker recently got a 15 million euro loan to do educational projects in the EU. Maybe they see this newfound money as a means to invest into patents that can reap rewards for years to come.

Edit: I think we should wait and see what they do with the patents. Patents exist, and so does stealing of ideas and innovations. I think it is okay to have patents to defend against copycats and thiefs. It is also okay to have patents to put the know how and intellectual property of a company onto the balance sheets. It is not okay to use patents as a means to fight the competition, and hurt innovation. Ultimately, it is up to what they do with it.

And opposition.. It's not the UK vs the EU, the UK just happens to be one of the larger and more influential detractors,  which given that the UK also happens to be one of the EU's larger military players has been a bit of a problem.

&gt;Frankly no one cares anymore what the UK (or anyone else) thinks about it at this point, we will do as we wish.

Who is 'we' in this context? The EU can't move forward with this without unanimity, its one of those areas where the EU can't act, it doesn't have the relevant competencies. So unless you bring all the other EU members along (and even once the UK has left, they aren't all on side..) you can't just do as you wish.

&gt;One thing that Brexit has made me realise is how insecure the UK is. I don't think the UK would be so anti-Germany and anti any measures that make the EU stronger if the UK didn't feel threatened about its influence and size inside the EU. The bizarre thing is that the whole act as turned into a bravado about being actually a bigger power in the world than it could be in the Eu. Good luck finding out how that works out!

People in the UK don't really have the same hopes for the EU as some people across the rest of the EU do, that is the problem. We don't want the same things, it isn't an anti-German position, or an anti-French position, it is a difference in opinion. That isn't insecurity either nor do most people in the UK feel threatened by the EU.

What I always do find surprising though is this continuous argument from some on the pro-EU side that countries can't hold their own individually, or that only as part of the EU can European countries remain relevant, or retain their power against the US and China and Russia and so on.  And of course that the EU is therefore powerful and will crush those that don't toe the line (because that's how people think powerful states should act now apparently..).

&gt;The bizarre thing is that the whole act as turned into a bravado about being actually a bigger power in the world than it could be in the Eu. 

The argument is really quite simple and not that bizarre. The UK could either a fair bit of influence within the EU, in exchange for giving up almost all of its international relevancy (the idea being that the EU members pool their resources.) or it could, outside of the EU, simply represent itself at the international level. Both are valid, both probably give the UK very similar levels of ability to present their own interests.

Ill check out the small value ETF. VUN and VTI are basically the same, but VTI trades in the US whereas VUN trades on the TSX. VUN just holds VTI but has a higher expense ratio (0.22 i think). It didn't make much sense to bother with currency conversion just for VTI, but since the other funds I wanted trade in the US only I figured I might as well switch to VTI.

I am usually happy to take a contrarian view (if the USD has gone up recently id rather not invest in it) so I would have ideally liked the trend to have been worse. I still think couch potato had a good point. The Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board has a similar perspective on CAD hedging and doesn't hedge (Canada's largest pension plan) because it is all driven by commodities. The recent performance is all because of oil and metals (copper, gold).

Additional context on spending in CAD: I have no idea where ill be in the next 5 - 10 years. There is a significant possibility that I might be in the states (career opportunities I am actively looking for are mostly in the states). But I may be back longer term. Still, you have good points, I will reconsider the exposure. I think the tilt may not be as bad as you believe because 10% is currently CAD, 30% is Rupee, Remnibi/Yuan, Euro (and other europe currencies). The 30% is volatile, but has no direct correlation to the USD exposure; I think it might even be a bit negative (just guessing, will look into this).

By actually *living in Spain* and traveling around the EU a bunch.  I was talking about experience, not statistics.

&gt; I think my piece was pretty clear on this.

I think your piece was a bunch of self-serving drivel, but to each his own.  The original poster claimed that *all* europeans, in *his* experience, had little trouble communicating, notably *in English*.  He said that with an admitted bias towards northern Europe - him being Dutch, his examples Nordic and eastern EU.  My experience differed.

&gt; That's all true and fair, but how is this related to English classes, the part you brought up? Answer: It isn't.

Pedantic at best.  Sure, I quoted that part, just to quote something.  What do classes have to do with proficiency, or the experience of trying to communicate with those from these places in English?  Nothing.

&gt; Calling official EU statistics misleading but guessing the age of the playerbase. Not to mention 2008 is 9 years ago, so the people who these statistics apply to are now in their mid 20's. Means they'd fall under your guestimated average age. You're going to have to do better.

There *are no statistics* about the average age - there are plenty about *gamers in general*, and those track with my supposition, but that goes against your narrative (not that I'm quite sure what  is supposed to be).

What, exactly, is your beef with my statements?  All I was trying to say is that English proficiency in southern Europe is much worse than in northern Europe.  Nothing you have replied with has addressed this, other than trying to claim that studying English in secondary school somehow makes a population proficient in the language...

Which is idiotic!

Go to Texas or California and try to get by on *only* Spanish.  There is a *compulsory* 12 years of Spanish education there, too - regardless of the quality of the education, which your point didn't address, so this amounts to the same thing.  In my experience - I grew up in Texas - the level of English proficiency in Spain is about equal (maybe a tad better) as the level of Spanish proficiency in Texas.  Which is to say **BAD**.  Regardless of schooling.  Same goes for France and Italy, but not Portugal, Denmark, or Holland.  Germany is somewhere in the middle, being very geo-and-socio-economically biased.",t5_2ym13,master-xul,ded9qom,t3_5wrq0m,

National Socialism, Ethno-Nationalism, and facism, are all very different from Naziism, since a *very* central aspect of the Nazi movement was German supremacy.

In your question you argue that Nazis viewed Scandinavians, people from the Netherlands or the British Isles as ""basically worthy noble superior races."" And this is true, to a degree, but no more ""worthy"" than they were willing to attack, conquer, and if necessary slaughter them, all in their quest of the ""Drang nach osten""

There was also a great amount of esoteric-mysticism, as well as paganism, in the Nazi movement, all things that many modern Ethno-Nationalists, facists, and National-Socialists would disagree with. 

A good analogy would be, why are there homosexual or black communists, when Che Guevara was a racist and homophobe? Well, since there are many different branches within communism, just as in nationalism, socialism, and facism.

I'd argue those should be the priorities as with loanees we should have depth in central midfield and central defence though i could see Conte being interested in upgrading both of those if the right players become available especially midfield.

They don't get the right to freely obtain more rewards because they are no longer vulnerable. They risked their lives to come to a better country; they should be fighting with everything they have to learn the language, go to school, and earn a job.

**Brockton Crusade**: Ugh, what a mess. It taught me a lot in terms of writing stories of value, but it was shockingly poor itself. No real character arc, massive escalation, random plot insertions for no apparent reason. Not a good piece of work – tragically, also my longest piece of work. 

**Nike**: I think this falls into decent, but flawed. My main problem with Nike is that I overestimated my own capacities in terms of writing. I’d planned out for a much longer story, but basically massively underestimated my own burnout. Now, what I should have done is put it on hiatus – but I was a bit afraid of never coming back to it, so didn’t. That’s one of my larger regrets fic wise, actually. 

**Internship**: The first of my fics that I think I could tentatively call ‘good’, with qualifications. It retains pacing issues, mostly because 1k word updates once per day mean something interesting has to happen in most updates to get people looking at the story. The ending also jumped the shark a spot and was a little rushed, in retrospect. Still, not too awful. Hopefully. 

**Foundations**: I sort of hiatused it, but I think what was written was okay. Still trying to figure out where to go with it, in honesty, but I do have a few ideas involving building Taylor up, then smashing her down until it all goes wrong. Because not every story can be happy. 

**Prodigal**: First time experimenting with two protagonists, and I think it’s gone okay considering the inherent challenges. Still need to work out exactly what I want to do with it, but that’s a work in progress as I get back into writing fanfic. 

**Atelic**: Only just started the thing, obviously, so no real judgement yet. I do find the conversation around it interesting, but my lack of deep knowledge on later canon (compared to early canon) is something of a stumbling block. Also, having the protagonists be terrorists might not help, I’m not sure. 

**Set Europe Ablaze**: With a title like that, how could you not love it, right (#Brexit). Anyway, I think it works well enough. Slow update schedule + small chapters means that it’s not a particular hit, but I do like the concept certainly, and it’s actually got a fully worked out plot. So I think it’s okay. 

**Descent**: Chucked it up as proof of concept, deeply limited interest and so dropped the whole thing. Which is kind of sad on one level, because it would combine two of my favourite things (Worm + UN). However, considering the totally insane AU the whole thing was, that is hardly surprising in honesty. 

**A More Perfect Union**: Dropped due to timing mostly, but an interesting concept, I think. Something to maybe revive at some point, I’m not sure. 

**Path to Cuddles**: Huge missed opportunity, in my opinion. It derailed into crack far too fast for my liking – not that it’s bad crack, per se, but I could have done much more with the concept than I did. 

**Lighthouse**: Bad, pending a full rewrite. I want an actual workup of Alexandria’s personality, not more Toddler!Taylor shenanigans, much as they are very funny and cute. 

So yeah, that's my position - I'd welcome thoughts on them. ",t5_33pt9,,dedakuz,t3_5ww022,

You're right. ""Fixing prices"" by altering supply or demand or prices themselves (looking at you Venezuela) with political measures tends to (always does, according to the works of Ronald Coase) backfire and make the situation worse - sometimes spectacularly so.

As Ireland's economic success pulls it towards the top of EU countries its most industrious areas (big cities mostly) will probably tend to align on other major EU cities in many ways: population types and social standing (as well as social issues - expect drug abuse on the rise), real estate trends, types of job and spending, etc. Some aspects of this evolution usually get called 'gentrification', but it's really just a fraction of the whole thing. The baser issue is that the people coming into the developping areas and the people who have been living there do not spend their income the same way, and one big difference is on the share they allocate to housing. There's a change of population dynamics and not just a supply deficiency.

I suspect the ""correct"" way to address the real estate market issues in Ireland would be more mobility and more urban development where it is not yet happening, so that people who are priced-out of areas that are transforming into ""cosmopolitan"" sort of cities have a way around housing becoming increasingly inadequate to their needs ; and so that other areas of Ireland can develop into suitable environments for such evolutions.

&gt;DESPITE its vote to leave the European Union, plenty of Europeans still seem keen to move to Britain: in eastern European cities such as Kiev and Chisinau leaflets promising “English visas” still flutter. Marion, a lawyer who recently moved to London from Paris, says that Brexit barely featured in her decision. “I guess that emotionally I still find Brexit hard to believe.” Britain’s government, however, is busy thinking of ways to keep them out.

&gt;Since June’s referendum result, many have wondered anxiously whether Britain will remain part of the EU’s single market after Brexit. The pound tumbled when Theresa May, the prime minister, said that she planned to leave it. People have worried less, however, about the economic impact of the government’s post-Brexit immigration policy. This is strange: the impact of slashing the number of foreigners allowed into Britain could be as serious as anything that could happen to trade. 


&gt;In the year to September net migration (immigration minus emigration) was under 300,000, split about evenly between EU and non-EU folk. It has been high by historical standards (see chart) since the mid-2000s, when citizens from new, poorer EU members acquired the right to move to Britain.

&gt;Despite the continuing influx, net migration into Britain is hardly out of control, at least compared with other rich countries. On average annually it amounts to about three times the attendance at a Manchester United football match. Compared with their population, Ireland, Australia and Canada see far more new arrivals.

&gt;But British concern about immigration has little to do with raw numbers. Even in 1995, when net migration was well under 100,000, two-thirds of Britons wanted it cut. No reference to immigration appeared on the ballot paper, but politicians believe that the Brexit vote represented a desire to “take back control” of the country’s borders. Since then Mrs May and Amber Rudd, the home secretary, have repeated a long-standing commitment to cut annual net migration to the “tens of thousands”.

&gt;That will be no easy task. The government will have to count on about 50,000 Britons continuing to quit the country each year. If settling in Europe becomes harder for Britons after Brexit, that may not happen. Even if the rules are changed, the number of non-Britons settling each year, minus the number leaving, would have to fall to around 150,000.

&gt;Net migration of family members and refugees is around 70,000. On February 22nd the government largely prevailed in a case in the Supreme Court, allowing it to set tough income requirements on those who want a loved one to join them. The ruling’s wording, however, implies that tightening these rules further will be tricky. Meanwhile, reducing immigration by unskilled workers from outside the EU is difficult since it is almost non-existent, says Jonathan Portes of King’s College London.

&gt;About half of the EU nationals emigrating to Britain move into less-skilled jobs. Cutting that sort might reduce net migration by EU workers to 50,000 (a slowing economy is already helping). Halving net migration of foreign students, say by restricting the growth of universities (though that would hamper a lucrative industry), might reduce it to 50,000. But that might still leave total net migration at around 150,000. If the government is serious about hitting its tens-of-thousands target, it may have to restrict skilled migration. 

&gt;That would sit oddly alongside its recent white paper on Brexit, which promised to “encourage the brightest and the best to come to this country”. And it would weaken Mrs May’s negotiating hand. In 2015 combined net migration from America and India was about 30,000. Cutting that would be awkward for the prime minister, who is desperate to strike post-Brexit trade deals with both.

&gt;How would the economy cope if the tens-of-thousands target were reached? Firms reliant on foreigners are worried. Food manufacturers are vulnerable: 40% of such workers are non-British. Skilled industries would also suffer: a quarter of scientific researchers are foreign-born.

&gt;It may be for that reason that David Davis, the Brexit secretary, this week hinted that Britain is not about to shut the door even on unskilled EU migrants. Other Brexiteers, however, counter that ending the supply of cheap workers would shake up Britain’s business model for the better. Firms would invest in labour-saving technology, boosting Britain’s low productivity. One study of American tomato-growers finds some evidence to support this thesis. If productivity rose, those workers left behind might see higher wages. Britons might also see less competition for jobs.

&gt;But these effects are likely to be small. If the benefits of investing in technology were so great, bosses should have already done so. And many jobs—such as care work—are not easily performed by robots. In these industries, many firms will either become less profitable or go under.

&gt;Few economists see lower immigration leading to a wage bonanza for locals. One paper calculates that cutting migration to the tens of thousands could boost wages in industries most affected by it by an imperceptible 0.2-0.6% by 2018.

&gt;And these tiny increases would be dwarfed by a slowdown in the wider economy. According to research by Katerina Lisenkova of Strathclyde University, annual net migration of 100,000 would lower GDP per person by 1% in the long term. Others reckon the economic cost of lower migration could match that of the hit to trade from Britain leaving the single market.

&gt;The biggest loser from slashing immigration would be the public finances. Native Britons are ageing rapidly; the number who are of working age is shrinking. When counting only native-born folk, Britain has a higher “old-age dependency ratio” (the number of elderly people as a share of those of working age) than that of many European countries, including France, and it is worsening fast. This drives up spending on health care and pensions.

&gt;As it stands, the flow of people into and out of Britain tilts the numbers favourably, improving the dependency ratio. Britain exports old, creaky people and imports young, taxpaying ones. More than 100,000 British pensioners live it up in sunny Spain; meanwhile, up to 100,000 working-age Spaniards brave the British cold.

&gt;With low net migration, Britain’s elderly would be more burdensome. Workers would need to be taxed more heavily to pay for care for their elders. The government’s fiscal watchdog suggests that by the mid-2060s, with annual net migration of about 100,000, public debt would be roughly 30 percentage points higher than if that figure were 200,000. Taking back control comes with a whopping bill.",t5_2qh4j,SLOV,dedb200,t3_5wwfnk,

It was not flattery, other countries (especially Germany) were not necessarily happy to lose the pole position.
But UK was in the big 3 together with Germany and France making the big decisions. As a result of this and it's conservatory attitude, UK had the biggest influence on EU out of ALL countries.


As for the future:

 * London was the biggest city in EU as GDP and highly skilled professionals
 * UK's economy was the only large one to be massively service oriented

As for the extra billion, it is in the treaties, everybody is paying in. Anyway, UK has a special status with large rebates and a lot of money coming back to Wales , Cornwall etc. UK in general has the lowest net contribution per capita out of all western Europe, if you exclude PIGS countries and eastern Europe.

You were paying 110 Euros a year, per capita. That is 2 euros a week - the price of a newspaper.


As a comparison, the severely underfunded NHS budget is around 100, with 8 bln a year increase until 2020. But again, this is government's responsibility on what to do with it. Maybe if UK didn't oppose EU clamping down on tax havens, you would've have enough money for NHS.


You could say ""but why do we pay for the Poles and Romanians? why give them free money?"". Well, it's not actually free money, we also pay into EU, just not in cash. We lifted all protectionism and allowed EU companies to buy everything for pennies: factories, banks, oil reserves, land, forests. The main reason EU economy is growing is EE expansion, nobody thinks western politicians are giving money to east Europe out of the goodness of their hearts. Most of our economy is now owned by EU companies, 75% of big exporters are foreign companies. Anyway we work for a western company if we stay at home or emigrate to Western Europe.

Sure, but he waffles between center right and far right.  That shit ain't for me.

&gt; Before Trump, we practically had a new wave of The Yellow Press.  Our media is shit, and one of the only things that has made them actually do investigative reporting and care about their credibility in the past decade is Trump.

Trump exposed their lack of credibility with the public with his victory.  They've been squandering that credibility for decades.

&gt; Bingo.  Couldn't have said it better myself.

I think Chomsky said it best:
&gt; Goebbels was in favor of free speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If you’re really in favor of free speech, then you’re in favor of freedom of speech for precisely the views you despise. Otherwise, you’re not in favor of free speech.
&gt; - Noam Chomsky

&gt; First off, I don't think I would consider those ""fake news"".  I'm a CS major, and the level of protection we have on our power grid is criminally lax.  They usually run those stories as alarmist pieces whenever we have renewed terror fears or a new enemy overseas, you can find them all over the place post-911.  Most of the time, people don't really get freaked over them unless they know more about our infrastructure.

The allegations of Russian hacking of our power grid were false.  Moreover, they were part of a concerted effort to engender public anger and hostility towards Russia.  It was coordinated propaganda.

&gt; And Russia is behind a massive explosion of fake news.  All countries are, after they've seen how effective it's been.  That's not new either, you can see it as far back as the Cold War, when we broadcast propaganda by radio into the Iron Curtain in order to get Eastern European countries to revolt.  

Propaganda and information control is as old as civilization.  Russia's strikes me as crude and transparent.  When that cheap and amateurish propaganda beats ours, as it frequently did in regards to the Syria war for example, it's evidence of how much bullshit we're slinging.

&gt; I agree that our media, and even The Washington Post, is incredibly imperfect, alarmist, often biased, and lacking the necessary credibility, but compared to publications like The New York Post or The Washington Times, I think they're doing okay.

Our media manufactures public opinion at the behest of their owners.  The concentration of ownership and associated narrowing of propaganda goals has and will continue to damage their credibility.  When their merits must be exposed through comparisons to garbage like the New York Post and Washington Times it's truly hopeless.

Let me point out one issue I take with your analysis: 

&gt; The scientific claim (and the opinions of climate scientists) that global warming will have a largely negative effect isn't wholly sound, and doesn't accurately factor in all the risks and benefits.2

Reading your source I did not find any mention of the conflicts/costs associated with economic migration occurring from regions harmed by warming, into other regions. Massive migration from areas that become far less livable into other societies (like into Europe/the west for example) could cause significant social and political conflicts. Such tensions could set off military conflicts, which is the a core concern that your second source does not address. Without accounting for the potential costs of such conflicts, one cannot really make a proper estimate of the costs of global warming. And I am very surprised that your source entirely neglects the topic of migration-related political/military conflict - arguably one of the most important (maybe even *the* most important) concerns. All it does is do a cost-benefit analysis of the literal warming effects itself, which is a horribly incomplete analysis. ",t5_3cct3,Anarchist,dedbnca,t3_5wi0e3,

Plate armour gets its start in the 13th century in the form of a pair (or 'coat') of plates for the torso, followed by limited limb protection. I write about the very early history of plate armour [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4wds16/was_plate_armor_used_during_the_13th_century/). In the 14th century the extent and sophistication of plate armour worn by soldiers expands enormously, as does the availability of that plate armour. While in 1300 mail was the primary defense, supplemented with plate, in 1400 plate armour is the primary defense, supplemented by mail. In some places in Europe, like Italy, the mail shirt was still worn under mail, and would continue to be worn for decades more after plate armour reached its 'fullness.' In other places, such as England, even in the 3rd quarter of the 14th century men at arms were discarding full mail shirts and wearing supplemental pieces of mail instead - sleeves to protect the arms, gussets and voiders for the underarms, 'pisans' or 'standards' for the neck and 'paunces' or skirts for the lower torso, crotch and upper thigh. This corresponds to a preference to more complete limb armour, and hints at very complete torso protection as well. In addition, the English men at arms from Crecy onwards often fought on foot in full armour, so saving weight was important. So even well before 1400 men at arms were using plate armour as their primary defense. 

But that isn't the whole story - plate armour was continuing to develop in the later 14th and early 15th century, and this is what people mean when they say that 'full' plate armour wasn't developed until 1420. Some men at arms at the very end of the 15th century wear an uncovered single-piece breastplate, like that on the [Pistoia Altarpiece](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f0/97/51/f097517e8a937909fde2a7b4d69fead4.jpg). But many breastplates in the later 14th century were covered, like [This breastplate in Munich](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/75/ee/d4/75eed4915ec69fe97b27ec19882200a3.jpg). Though this is an aesthetic distinction, covered breastplates don't fit our image of the 'knight in shining armour'. In addition, until around 1400 many breastplates were in two parts in the front, and were joined with straps (a style some people today call 'corazinna' though I have seen little evidence that the term was used at the time - they may have called it a 'brigandine' like the 15th century front-opening garment of small plates). Most importantly, the backplate didn't develop until some time after 1400 - until then the back was either protected with mail or with smaller metal plates, as it had been by 'pairs of plates' earlier in the 14th century. In addition, the neck was often protected by a mail 'aventail' hung from the helmet until the beginning of the 15th century, when plate throat defenses become more common with the introduction of the ['great basinet'](http://ageofcraft.com/image/cache/data/product/Helmets/GrandBasc/05_Grand_bascinet_Inv.____637_PO_H-1000x1000.jpg). Personally, I think it is too narrow to say that 'full plate armour didn't develop until 1420' - plate armour was the primary defense from the third quarter of the 14th century onwards in many places, even though some parts of the full plate harness were still being developed after 1420. But this is a matter of definitions.

On the other side of the timeline, the decline of full plate armour is far more complex than armour becoming obsolete when firearms became more common in the 15th century. On the contrary, the later 15th and 16th century was arguably the high point of plate armours quality and quantity in Europe - the metallurgy of the best armours was at its most refined, and their construction was technically impressive in the way that it combined rigidity and flexibility. Meanwhile partial armours for the infantry were more available than ever before, as munition breastplates replace brigandines and cloth armour for infantryman. Men at Arms were still used on the battlefield of the early 16th century, and used decisively - the charge of the French *gendarmes* into the rear of the Imperial army at Ravenna won the battle for the French. The reasons for armour's continued relevance are several - first, firearms were not nearly as prevalent as they would become later in the 16th century - in 1500 arquebusiers made up a minority of armies, while in 1600 they were a majority. Secondly, the 'pike and shot' tactics that allowed firearms to be used in open field battles had not yet been perfected. Finally, firearms and gunpowder were much less powerful than they would become later in the 16th century as heavy, long-barrelled muskets were developed and 'corned' gunpowder was introduced. In addition, gunpowder becomes much cheaper over the course of the 16th century as the secret of manufacturing saltpetre in 'nitre beds' by sprinkling urine on manure (yes, really) spreads.  

Rather than being rendered obsolete with the introduction of gunpowder, full plate armour declines in use over the 16th century, beginning around 1530. Full plate harnesses are being made and apparently worn into the later part of the 16th century, though in the second half of the century more and more soldiers wear partial armour. There are a number of factors to this very complex development, and the increasing power of firearms and the increasing weight of armour is only part of this story, though I write about this at length [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4y2d1k/how_and_why_did_armies_move_from_using_iron_armor/?) and discuss the successes and failures of making bulletproof armour [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5udybq/how_effective_was_plate_armor_against_musketballs/). In addition to the technological devleopments in gunpowder and heavier breastplates 'of proof' requiring soldiers to discard the extra weight of limb armour, there are a lot of indications that more and more soldiers preferred not to fight as men at arms for economic reasons - it was cheaper to outfit oneself as a pistol-armed 'Reiter' or partially armoured 'demi-lancer' rather than a knight. 

Thus both the introduction and the decline of plate armour is not clear cut, and the reasons for armour's eventual decline are not a simple matter of improved technology making previous technology obsolete immediately (though the introduction of gunpowder is a critical part of the story). I think this is a good illustration of how technological development occurs - it is not a simple story of gunpowder as a 'killer app' or the gun as a world-changing gadget, but of a complex interaction of multiple technological developments with social, political and economic developments.

&gt; Population of Beijing being 21.5 million, minus about 1.5-1.6m for kids still growing and lets just pretend the elderly included don't lose an inch or two due to poor posture and lessening cartilage in their spine and include them anyway. That gives us a theoretical sample size of about 40 000 people surveyed

What? First, you don't get statistical sampling? [Read up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics). Fun fact. This principle is why PEW surveys only need to sample about 3000 people to get a statistically significant conclusion on the whole population of US on political opinions.

&gt; That still means the majority of the male population are thus around 5' 8""-5' 10"" with taller and shorter being statistical outliers, that is a fair assumption, wouldn't you say?

Fun fact, you don't have to guess. Standard deviation tells you % of people in each interval...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule

Since height standard deviation of males across the whole world is about 7 cm

http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9730/what-is-the-standard-deviation-of-adult-human-heights-for-males-and-females

68% of young Chinese males in Beijing are between 174.7 +- 7cm, ie between 5'6'' and 6'0''.

&gt; That means 88.38% of the population would be at least 2 inches shorter than me, and that's if we're being generous with estimates, all according to the numbers supplied by your own link. I said 90% were shorter than me, so that extra 1.62% should actually be a conservative estimate of how many Beijing males cover that little gap between 5' 9"" and me.

Ok, using the information above and the fact that you are 6'1'', ie 185 cm. The portion of Beijing people (post malnutrition era) who are between 175 cm and your height 185cm are ~40% of the male population, because your height is only about 1.4 sigma above standard deviation. 

That would also mean about ~10% of the young male population are taller than you, because 10% is about the % of samples above 1.4 sigma. Tell me again how you dwarf 99% of Beijing and Shanghai? 10% of them dwarf you, I am sorry. You are just blind due to confirmation bias.

Since you failed at basic stats knowledge, I won't even bother correcting your bullshit stats inference you spew. I am already pretty retarded for wasting time correcting a retard.

&gt; Depends on how you define ""East Asia"". If you include South East Asia, that drags the average way down, Indonesians being the shortest nationality in the world.

Simply not true. If you look at the statistics on that page, they were the only number that surveyed only 50+ people.

This is hilarious when white country tends to post 18-22 university guys and/or self-reported numbers, while they tend to use the general population (or old people only) and/or measured numbers for Asian nations.

&gt; However, the Middle East seems to range anywhere between 5' 5""- 5' 9.5"" with most skewing taller

No? I am seriously questioning whether you are blind?

Iraq – Baghdad	165.4 cm (5 ft 5 in)

Iran	170.3 cm (5 ft 7 in)

Saudi Arabia	168.9 cm (5 ft 6 1⁄2 in)

Qatar	170.8 cm (5 ft 7 in)

Bahrain	165.1 cm (5 ft 5 in)

Only Israel is (5 ft 9 1⁄2 in) when they only surveyed 18-21, but since they are rich like the west, the height difference is well explained.

&gt; It's true, though. On average, South America as a continent have bigger dicks, but as a country, Congo has everyone beat at an average length of 7"".

Except if you click through those links, most of the numbers are made up. I bet you money that you can not find me that paper that states Congo have average length of 7"". It is all sourced from a white supremacist ""disguised as racial realist"" Richard Lynn. Made up to support his theory that Asians are smarter, but physically inferior, blacks are stupid, but physically superior, while whites are perfectly in between, best of both worlds.

Most of the country on that map DO NOT have a single paper researching the penis size of that nation. Trust me. People went and tried to dig it up, but they simply do not exist. For one, how the fuck do they know North Korean penis size?

Here is some real researched numbers with direct link to the papers.

https://np.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/18gzib/false_asian_stereotypes/

Since you believe in the ""short asian"" bullshit, it is no wonder you believe in this racial penis bullshit too. So typical. Fucking white supremacy propaganda prevades the entire world.

&gt; Except it's not. The last widespread famine of China ended in 1961, meaning it should hold no great statistical significance when 70% of the adult population of China was born after 1955. The average height for males in the Eastern Bloc countries (the poorest regions of Europe) is 5' 10""-5' 11"".

Except however poorer EE is compare to China, throughout the communist era, they are still much better fed and wealthier than most Chinese. Chinese GDP has been growing like crazy, while EE GDP has been growing comparatively much slower, yet GDP per capita, EE countries are still 2-3x that of China to this day. Look it up. They were 10x richer than China, per capita wise, pre economic reform days.

You don't get just because people aren't starving to death, they aren't eating much pre-economic reform started around 1985-ish. Any Chinese kids growing up before 1990 are very malnutritioned compared to western standards. Chinese kids in non-urban areas continue to be so to this day.

&gt; Except some stereotypes are true because they're based directly on physique, which is based on genetics. Asians are, on average, shorter than westerners. The links you sent make that point explicitly clear in detailed numbers, you just chose to ignore most of them that didn't conform to your own preconceptions.

Nope, not genetics. Totally due to nutrition and dietary habits (ie small portions and stronger fat shaming standards in Asia). But it doesn't stop white supremacists from using it as a reason why whites are superior to Asians.

If you are not white supremacist, drop this racial superiority complex. And stop spinning this shortness as if it doesn't create a racial superiority complex. That's like thinking blacks have low intelligence test based on how they do on IQ tests, and say ""hey, I am not racist. Being of low intelligence isn't an insult.""",t5_2qqjc,,dedc05p,t3_5w4227,

 **comment content**: O fato da vítima ser bandido é irrelevante (ele não seria punido mesmo que fosse a namorada dele). Ele ser bandido apenas reforça a insensatez de se esperar que ele seja alvejados pelos tiros sem tentar se defender. Tecnicamente falando, a Legítima Defesa só pode ser arguida contra quem está te atacando, o que não seria o caso de um cara inconsciente.

O que exclui a punibilidade (possibilidade de punição), é o fato de não ter outra forma dele se salvar sem usar outra pessoa como escudo. O direito não espera que ninguém seja de tal forma altruísta.

Tem uma história que sempre é contada para explicar isso melhor 'O Caso dos Exploradores de Caverna'.

Nesse caso, um grupo de 06 escavadores ficou preso após um soterramento causado por um terremoto natural. Imediatamente eles acionaram as autoridades e estavam aguardando socorro. Acontece que quando a ajuda chega, é constado que seria preciso 30 dias para chegar até os Escavadores e os mantimentos que eles tinham somente dava para 05 dias. Também é constatado que eles morreriam por volta do 10ª dia se não arrumassem outra fonte de alimento.

Depois do 9º dia, já com muita fome e quase morrendo, os escavadores fazem uma votação para que um deles fosse morto pelos demais para então servir de comida. Um deles é escolhido e é morto e consumido pelo grupo - assim, os 05 homens conseguem sobreviver os 20 dias restantes e são resgatados.

A pergunta é: cometeram os homens algum crime? a resposta é sim. Homicídio. Mas devem ser punidos? Não. Por que não é razoável esperar que as 06 pessoas morressem de fome. O ser humano é acima de tudo um animal que é movido por instintos também, inclusive o da sobrevivência.

Nesse caso da caverna, o terremoto não foi causado por nenhum dos 06 homens, e eles não tinham outra forma de se salvar (a história mudaria se, por exemplo, o que propôs o ato de canibalismo estivesse escondendo mantimentos).

Outra analogia relevante é a do náufrago: imagine que você consegue sobreviver a um naufrágio ao se segurar num pedaço de madeira. Todavia, uma outra pessoa tenta se segurar na mesma madeira, e é óbvio que a madeira não vai aguentar duas pessoas. Se você empurrar ela para longe da madeira e ela morrer afogada, você cometeu homicídio, porém, em estado de necessidade.

É exatamente o caso do OP. Ele empurrou alguém na frente da bala, mas o fez em estado de necessidade. Esse alguém poderia ser qualquer pessoa, diga-se de passagem.

* 3. so far no details at all on any real tax cuts
* 4. haven't seen any spending cut proposals out of WH/Congress that haven't been more than overbalanced with spending increases (e.g. $56B increase in defense spending when we're not at war, building the wall)
* 5. travel industry has already lost $128m due to fallout over immigration as europeans aren't planning vacations in the US, this is likely to continue to get worse - following the Kansas shooting, Indians are deciding not to come to the US because it's viewed as ""unsafe""
* 6. border tariffs will hurt our manufacturing industries

I think domestically tax cuts and deregulation are great for business and nobody does this better than the republicans. However Trump's foreign policy seems to alienate trading partners and people who would want to spend money in the US, and trade wars and tariffs on international goods will hurt domestic businesses, since, let's be fair, America is on top because our businesses rely on global supply chains.

I'm not anti immigration, but Canada has screwed up a lot in the past. Sure, we don't have the issues with so many illegals that the US has, or Europe, mainly due to geography. 

But people love to throw around this ""economic immigration"" concept like it's some amazing thing. There's a reason we have low median wages (especially for skilled workers compared to USA). There's a reason immigrants end up leaving Canada to places like the USA or Hong Kong. We simply do not pay well enough. Part of this is the high intake of immigrants.

Choose one. 

I am 100% sure he rejected this one because he doesn't leave halfway through a contract. But if China comes offering again in the summer, would he choose the 30m or the job in Europe? Wenger has no qualms in going to other countries, he did it with Japan, and going to China allows him to avoid some media pressure as well. 

Sure, Wenger could think, ""I have too much money"", but no one knows that for sure, and neither of us can comment on how rich people think, unless you happen to be rich yourself, in which case I apologize.

""Parliamentary immunity (or ""privilege"") is first and foremost intended as a defence of the Parliament itself as a democratically elected institution, protecting its collective independence from outside pressures and guaranteeing its members' freedom of word and deed when carrying out their duties.

In ancient Rome the tribunes of the people enjoyed special protection so that they could freely exercise their functions. Anyone who infringed that prohibition was liable to punishment and could even be executed. Today's right to immunity is based on the same basic idea: the representatives of the people must enjoy certain guarantees to underline the importance of their office and to give them the peace of mind they need to implement their mandate.

Italian MEP Giuseppe Gargani (EPP-ED) - Chair of the Legal Affairs Committee - describes it like this: ""immunity should be seen not as impunity but as an opportunity to exercise one's mandate"".

Immunity has been included in EU law since 1965. The relevant provisions read as follows: ""Members of the Parliament shall not be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties""."" - The European Union

There is useful data and then there is data that doesn't really provide anything for anyone. Sheldon Whitehouse is no.4 on the senate list. Where the hell do you get these sources from?

&gt; But it's data. You've provided nothing except her positions.

Lol. I just quoted you what the authors of the site themselves said about progressivepunch. Their methodology is not perfect and it's really hard to just flat out say that every position has a progressive or a conservative bias. It is even weird to identify every conservative stance as being anti-progressive. For instance, if I were to say that I am against ridiculous military spending, I am technically being conservative and a progressive. Take yourself for example. You think that you are a centrist. In reality, you would be considered a center-right Republican if we base it on the political spectrum of the 1970s.

&gt;And legalized gambling is progressive?

I actually don't have a strong opinion on gambling. Period. I honestly don't take it as a serious issue as opposed to the millions of other things that actually have an impact on other people's lives. You know, like healthcare, infrastructure spending, education, jobs, income inequality, the environment etc. are things that have a meaningful impact on people's lives. Hawaii has been anti-gambling for a long time and it's one of those things that most progressives would just go 'meh'. She did what was popular in her state. This is no different than Bernie supporting gun rights while advocating for common sense gun controls because his constituents are not exactly anti-gun. 

&gt;She worked closely with one of the most anti-progressive billionaires in the country. The bill was drafted by a lobbyist. It's the definition of rich people trying to make laws.

I thought you guys loved compromise? This sounds exactly like a progressive ""who likes to get things done"". Are you offended by the fact that she was working with a Republican? It almost sounds like you are suggesting that she took money from Adelson though. That's a pretty serious claim. Care to back it up? 

The issue on our side has always been that they took money from billionaires and voted accordingly. You must clearly have proof that she took money from Adelson and ""worked closely"" with the billionaire, right? I mean if she just worked with Chaffetz, that would be the ""compromise"" that you love to talk about day after day on this sub.

The company **boasts of having collected up to 5,000 data points on over 220 million Americans**. Secondly, it uses a unique method of analysis that doesn’t rely on traditional information, such as an individual’s geolocalisation, age or profession.

&gt;Instead, Cambridge Analytics creates a psychographic profile for each person. **The controversial practice allows the company to gauge a person’s intelligence and behavior through both objective and emotional information.** This data is used to draw conclusions about an individual, such as whether he or she is conservative, liberal or undecided, enjoys socialising, is easily upset, has a sexual preference, is recently divorced or is nervous by nature.

&gt;A campaign can then use this information to woo voters by **personalising the advertisements and videos that appear on their social media feeds**. For example, black voters in some states were targeted by content appearing to show Trump’s rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, referring to African-Americans as “sexual predators”, according to the website Motherboard. “Pretty much every message that Trump put out was data-driven,” Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander James Ashburner Nix told the publication.

&gt;In the UK, the Leave.eu campaign targeted prospective supporters by drafting dozens of emails that responded directly to their concerns based on information gleaned by Cambridge Analytics, The Guardian reported.

1. A lot of my travel is to use libraries in different parts of Europe to look at Renaissance manuscripts.  The Vatican library is a great thrill, and bizarre, but the oddest is probably trying to work at the Biblioteca Capitolare in Padua, near Venice.  I like to (humorously) rate European libraries at how successful they are at keeping people from getting at their books (since sometimes that feels like their goal!) and on that metric the Capitolare is my #1.  They're only open from 8 AM to noon on weekdays, but they're closed on the saints' days of any saint they happen to particularly like.  And within a week of Christmas, Easter, Epiphany, and a bunch of other holidays.  And for the whole month of August.  And a lot of other times.  But the problem is they don't have a website.  Or a phone! So you can't look up to check when they're closed, you just have to show up and hope.  You used to be able to phone the nice lady in the tabacchi shop across the street, and she'd go across and ask the monk when they'd be open, but I've lost contact with her since...  It was only on my third trip to Padua to try to use this library that I even got in the door!  But that isn't the masterpiece of what makes it the most challenging library, it's their catalog.  They don't have it.  The catalog is IN ROME.  Five hours away by train.  There are copies of it a few other places like Boston (by copies I mean photocopies of a handwritten transcription made by a German scholar in the late 19th century!) but there's no catalog in the entire city where the library is.  So you have to go to ANOTHER CITY, look up the book you need, write down the call number, then go to Padua and desperately hope that you have it right, or you have to go all the way back again!  It's an amazing library, with lots of materials from the University of Padua which was the center for radical heresy in much of the Renaissance (Galileo taught there!) but if you want to know why it's not studied very much it's because NO ONE CAN USE THE BOOKS!  Ahem.  But Padua is awesome in other ways, especially the medical school's operating theater where you can see the huge cone-shaped amphitheater where students used to crowd around to watch professors dissect cadavers.  There's even a secret compartment under the cadaver table, because sometimes they ran out of the bodies they were legally able to use and got extras by... unofficial channels... and if the authorities showed up during a dissection to catch them with a forbidden corpse, they would suddenly flip the table over and hide the body in the secret compartment, and they'd have a dead dog or something strapped to the underside of the table that would flip up so they could pretend they were just working on an animal.

Southeast Asia is also a nice place because it's cheap and has that ""exotic"" feel that westerners doing solo travel like. There are several problems that can come up where a solo traveler would be screwed. I'd recommend it if you were confident enough and had travelled before.

&gt; was this due to simply the size of the fleet or did British naval officers have exemplary tactical and strategic skills?

Saying that it was due ""simply to the size of the fleet"" is kind of putting the cart before the horse, because the British were able to sustain a large fleet due to expertise at administration. The boring stuff, like administration, a victualling system able to sustain the fleet overseas, a strong system of naval dockyards and repair facilities, and a relatively solid naval administration, are more important in the long run than simply skill of mariners and officers.

I wrote about this more [in this older thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2nydmp/how_did_the_british_navy_remain_dominant_for_such/). To quote from that a bit: 

&gt; * English (and later British) naval administration developed early, and was fairly consistent (in role if not in name) from the time of Samuel Pepys until well into the Napoleonic period, and after. The idea of having a naval administration that gathered under its wing at various points all the details of victualling, supplying ships, building and repairing ships, supplying ordnance, cordage, tackle, and stores, manning, and various other roles was important in naval development. (Note that this doesn't meant that the English/British government controlled all of this individually -- it still contracted with private individuals for many of these services.) Possibly the most important development related to this was having one single Admiralty budget, so that Parliament would have a good idea of the cost of a navy year-over-year.

&gt; * A shipbuilding tradition that was quick to innovate. English/British shipbuilders were relatively quick to adopt technological changes from around the North Sea. The French, by contrast, probably had a better academic understanding of seamanship from their universities, and were ahead of their competitors in hydrography and related marine sciences. They did not, however, move as quickly as their English counterparts in adopting innovations such as the wheel (replacing the tiller for steering); my resource has escaped me for the moment, but if memory serves, the French did not install wheels on their ships for almost 100 years after the British had them.

&gt; * An established infrastructure for repairing and storing ships over time. The dockyards at Deptford on the Thames were established by around 1500, with a basin being added to the drydock and dockyards in 1517. Deptford fell out of use as traffic increased on the Thames, but companion dockyards at Chatham, Sheerness, and eventually Portsmouth kept up the tradition of having sophisticated repair and building facilities that were ahead of England's and Britain's naval competitors.

&gt; * A tradition of seamanship that developed concurrently, and later independently, of the military (army) tradition of the country. Although early English naval organization mirrored that around most of northern Europe, with a soldier as ""captain"" of a ship and a sailor as ""master,"" the increasing specialization of the marine arts and the change from ""land battle at sea"" to actual naval warfare meant that the ""tarpaulin"" or seaman came to command ships, and, eventually, navies. (Compare this to the Spanish example, where the duke of Medina Sidona, the commander of the Armada, had rarely been to sea and suffered debilitating seasickness.) English and British officers went to sea as young boys, and got a practical education in seamanship that was lacking in other countries.

&gt;* A store of manpower for ships that was larger as a percentage of population than most Continental countries -- as an island nation that depended on trade, England/Britain had a repository of seamen that could form the core of even large ship companies when they enlisted or were impressed.

&gt;* An overall commitment to the Navy that was not present in much of Europe, where armies would be decisive. Britain could not survive as an independent nation without a navy, and has in fact been invaded from overseas several times -- that fact was not lost on Parliament during the wars of the 17th-19th centuries.

Here are some threads that may provide you with further insight: 

* [Ship Design and Construction in the Age of Sail](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/44sivx/ship_design_and_construction_in_the_age_of_sail/)

* [Classes of Vessels during the Age of Sail?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/20x9kz/classes_of_vessels_during_the_age_of_sail/)

* [What changes occurred in the construction, armament, management, and use of warships from the Anglo-Dutch wars up to and including the Napoleonic wars?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3pn7v5/what_changes_occurred_in_the_construction/)

* [How did a person become an officer in the British Navy around the era of the Napoleonic wars?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2vfe94/how_did_a_person_become_an_officer_in_the_british/)

As to your first question, the rough ""top five"" navies of this period fluctuates somewhat, but the major contenders for the title would be the British navy, followed in some order by the navies of France, Spain, the Netherlands, Russia and Denmark. Much of the role of the British navy in the period was defeating threats from combinations of those navies (conversely, much of the French plan to defeat Britain was to combine their naval forces with those of a third party and to defeat the British fleet in detail).",t5_2ssp3,moderator,dedfunf,t3_5wwpzs,

That actually goes to show how homogeneous Canada was that even a population of Christians from a slightly different cultural tradition caused alarm for their contemporaries.

&gt;Europe is as a whole a cultural mosaic, as were Canada's immigrants.

Not really. Canada's immigrants were a bit more than 50% from the British Isles until WWII, and assimilation occurred very rapidly into the anglo-Canadian majority, as proven by the very low retention rate of non-official languages in second-generation immigrants that arrived before the 70s. 

For example, you spoke of Ukrainians, well looking at second-generation Canadian 45 to 54 year-olds, 30 140 claim an Ukrainian ethnic origin, but only 4 530 claim Ukrainian as a mother tongue. That's a 85% conversion to English as mother tongue in one generation, a good marker of cultural integration.

Freedom of speech is in my opinion the absolutely most important principle liberal democracies have, and if we compromise it in such a way the very foundation of democracy is greatly diminished. 

What do you make of the fact that Norway, which has some of the most lax hate speech laws in Europe, is one of the European countries with the least significant far-right movements?

British are closer than you to such strange model, to this day they are proud of that little pinch of roman blood left from 9th legion, claiming conquerors as relievers (the fuck?). And even hardly ever they remember their main roots which is gaulish culture, praising again other conquerors - Norsemen.

But even if as with Germans their culture is artificial, in British case it was never desperation to claim their heritage, they already had it. Germanic culture and nation was forced by actions of Goths (who have hardly any corelation with Norseman), and afterwards by Catholic church, making them plain basic european nation.

It caused them to have identity crisis either in XIX century or even years before, which led to creating the lie of their norse ancestry. Even their language was created in that specific period.

You claim foreign companies pay payroll taxes, and you claim foreign companies pay corporate tax. Heres what youre not getting

Now, when you say payroll taxes, i assume youre referring to the retail worker who sells the product. Thats not what im referring to. Im referring to the payroll taxes on the person MAKING the product. If i have a business in the US, and i want to employ someone to make something, they get taxed every step of the way. So..... youre wrong :)

You kinda branched off of it when you were tlaking about this:

&gt; If you are an Asian or European company, you get taxed every step of the way in the US as well, as we have sales taxes in every single state. A sales tax is effectively no different than a VAT.

And there you get to the heart of your misunderstanding of how their tax code works. They use taxes on sales to lower the taxes on production. So while in the US, we get our profits from taxing them while they make it and taxing the profit of the corporation, in foreign goverments, they are able to tax them significantly less while they are making it, and in exchange they tax everyone who tries to sell it.

Your second main argument, that foreign companies pay corporate taxes as well, is just flat out wrong. Do you think companies change their headquarters to ireland and other tax havens because they like the weather? Its because they dont have to pay corporate tax on the lions share of their earnings if their headquarters is in ireland, whereas they do if their HQ is in the US. Have you never heard of [tax inversion?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_inversion) Or about how pfizer could have saved a [large fortune](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/pfizer-merger-tax-ducking-move-ireland-called-article-1.2590243) by moving its HQ to ireland?

You're just expressing emotional outrage at daring to even ask questions. That's exactly the sort of thing making me think there's something irrational going on. Your primary reaction isn't *huh, that's dumb and here's why*, it's panic. 

&gt;I have never even heard about the 11 million before. In Europe, the 6 million figure has always been used, because the Holocaust is defined as:

Well, now you have. I've seen it plenty of times and I'm just as European as you. The fact that *the* leading post-war Jewish activist threw around made up numbers doesn't seem strange to you?

I've also been exposed to survivors telling harrowing stories about concentration camps that turned out to be frauds. Either in that they completely made it up or just embellished things. I've some understanding for that, memory is very imperfect and any subject where any credulity in only one direction is disallowed is going to be very exploitable by charlatans. It's perfectly reasonable that the Holocaust happened exactly as described and that there are frauds. It's not so reasonable you can go to prison for talking about those frauds.

&gt;The 5,6-6,3 million figure has been established as the product of countless historians examining deportation logs, railway transportation logs, death camp arrival logs, Wehrmacht and SS reports, etc. etc. This is neither a joke nor is it even possible to falsify that number!

Ok, so why isn't academic discussion of that allowed? Personally I'm a little skeptical that you can get any evidence strong enough that it's *impossible* to falsify. You already put in a margin of error of about 16%, so why would 20% be so outrageous?

There's plenty of millions dead in WW2, very few people are going to suddenly think Hitler was a good guy (well, until enough time has passed and everyone will think he was a tragic hero like Charles XII or Napoleon). There are so many dead of any group that the pain and loss will be around for several decades to come. But it's only one group where people get angry about the accounting of the exact number of dead, to the point where it's illegal. It's fine discussing how many Finns, Poles, Russians, Magyars, Roma, Brits, Serbs, Chinese or whatever died. Not Jews, they're somehow holy.",t5_2s7yq,,dedk6jp,t3_5wuuvv,

In Asia (I'm British Indian, so inside perspective), there is so much pride. Japanese proud of their culture and past, Chinese proud of their culture and past and extremely proud about the direction they are heading, Indians proud of their culture, past and extremely proud about the direction they are heading and Russians too are very proud about their past and culture. 

If anyone one of those nations went to war, the whole of their population would go fucking berserk to fight and die for their country. If the UK went to war, I reckon of half of us would actually give a fuck and the other half would be trying to tear this country down from within and shit on it from a great height. The vitriol that came from Brexit was a perfect example of that. The amount of ""this country is going to shit"" or ""I'm leaving this country"" or ""this country has failed ourselves"" was disgusting.

Also, I mean, this country when toe-to-fucking-toe with Nazi Germany whilst near everyone else was capitulating but there's barely any great pride in it. Sure, there is some pride in it but in an Asian country they'd be going crazy over it and loving it. Like, even on Remembrance Day I don't feel that there's enough appreciation. There'd be parades and hundreds of thousands celebrating/honouring Remembrance Day in those Asian nations. Maybe it's just a London-centric view but...I don't think most people give a flying toss about one of the greatest and most ballsy events in the history of this country. 

I think the same is with Italy and Greece too. There are really 4 main great civilisations, Ancient Greece/Rome/India/China, now the latter 2, and rightfully so, wank themselves silly over their past, achievements and culture whereas the former two aren't particularly boastful about their past despite Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome being absolute titans. I don't know if it's just a European thing, i.e. guilt with WW2/nationalism. 

Less of a community, less of a sense of a shared spirit. In Europe, you'll hear ""Why be patriotic? I was just born here, didn't do anything, why should I be happy about the achievements of someone unrelated?"" or ""Yeah, [insert country]'s history is cool and [countryman] was cool but that was in the past and that guy has nothing to do with me so I'm not bothered"". Whereas, in Asia, it's like ""IDGAF, I love my country and its past and I'll die for the nation, I don't care if he wasn't related to me, he was from the same land and culture , we are of the same blood!""

It's bizarre and it's a bit of a fucking shame. I've experienced both, western pride and Asian pride, and Asian pride is far, far superior and heart-warming. ",t5_2qhcv,,dedkibw,t3_5wxbbn,

Upcoming talents: Sabak, Vanzeir, Coucke, Takidine (pretty sure there's a few more but those are the biggest ones)

Big changes in January transfer window: Lost Bailey and Ndidi which was massive considering they were our two best players and also have massive potential, also lost Karelis with a 6 month injury, he was our topscorer. 

Brought in a few players, the big ones being Berge and Ryan who I already consider being one of the key players. His presence on the pitch is such a difference compared to Bizot and that gives the defence more confidence, makes them play better. Naranjo has been alright but hasn't actually played that much, scored a goal. Missed a penalty in semi-final of the cup and we didn't go through to the final. Boëtius hasn't looked great but only been given a couple of minutes.

Current form: Far from great. Our play looks good but we have no end product. Our topscorer got an injury and his replacement (Samatta) has not looked good at all. We get so many chances but can not finish.

Compared to previous years: It's so difficult to say because we lose so many players so quickly because their potential is higher than the Belgian league. I'd have to go back to our last title which was in 2011 and we've actually only grown weaker instead of getting stronger, mainly due to a board that is quite shit. 

How the team's fans view their season so far, both in domestic league and Europe: Happy with Europa League, had some fantastic games mainly the two games against Bilbao in the groupstage. A 2-0 win at home and a crazy 5-3 loss in Bilbao. Not that happy that we drew Gent now because you'd like to play against a team now from your country but who knows, might have a decent chance at qualifying for the quarters now. 

As far as the league is concerned it's been very very disappointing. We're currently 8th with two games to go and you need top 6 to compete in play-off 1. Missing out on that would be horrendous. Not only because of more fans coming to the stadium but also the quality of play in play-off 1 is so much higher compared to play-off
 2. We all see it as quite a bad season in general with our incompetent board not replacing Bailey, Ndidi and Karelis soon enough.

Well actually, I think he tends to sexualize his female characters a little too much. I consider Murakami a guilty pleasure... :p It's also an interesting story when you consider that he really seems to like Western culture himself.

You're right, it could be interpreted a number of ways. It could even be as simple as Murakami showing the broken psyche of a white-worshipping Asian woman or bananarang haha. Could even be his version of the comments we write here? 

I think a lot of what he writes in this chapter actually would resonate with the crowd in this sub. There are a lot of connections between Miu's story and things I've read on here. For example, her hair turning white (after being ""defiled"" by a white man), her thinking of her Asian father (albeit positively) before she gets on the ferris wheel, her meeting a blonde german man in the park - one she says made her think of ""security""; the transactional nature of what was ""taken"" from her. 

When I read Miu's story though, it was before I found this website and its many asian subs. It kind of stunned me at the time, and it was an emotional read. As an Asian woman, I felt that the way Murakami sets up Miu's experience with racism in that little town was very relatable - maybe because I have also lived alone in a small European town. Anyway, sometimes men are able to let you know what is playing in their minds about you - even without saying anything explicit about it at all. I think this feeling is very well described in the chapter. My opinion is that Miu really did sleep with Fernando, and her ferris wheel tale about watching herself through her window is mostly made up. I think she is just having to look back objectively at an event she feels ashamed of. Isn't this pretty similar to how we think of past events or past regrets - almost like a third party objective viewer that's better able to consider all of the facts?

What I *hear* is that you have an industrialized penal system akin to slavery. How is that for Neutral?

I am comfortable commenting on Swedish politics because I do have some insight in it. I have provided that insight to the best of my ability in this thread.

As for the statement ""its not working out for the rest of the world"", I find it ambiguous. Now you're linking back to your two last comments, where you discuss how the US would react if Race specific statistics disappeared. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the way I understand it, Race is an official concept in the US, without much controversy.

So if I read you correctly, you mean to say that if Race statistics were to disappear in the US, there would be outrage. This is of course hypothetical, which is why the statement ""its not working out for the rest of the world"" is strange.

But anyways, suppose that it is so. Parallels wouldn't be ready-made between Swedish and US politics, because Race is not an official concept in Sweden. That means that people don't even *use* the word Race in daily parlance, in regards to people.

The fact that the government stopped ordering this report from Brå hasn't really sparked any outrage, at least not in itself. There is of course a strong nationalist movement in Sweden, that use this as one of their ""proofs"" that the media and government is lying to the people about immigrants and crime, but seriously... those people are impervious to facts in the first place.

A large part of the outrage in Sweden today stems from beggar immigrants from Romania (which is in the EU), to be honest. This is one of the most important catalysts people that are already angry, and it spills over to all immigrant groups. There is of course outrage at much else too, and that's fine. We need to talk about these things. 

Finally, anyone can look at court protocols in Sweden, and cross-check that with ethnicity if they want. And some dubious people do that, and it's fine, and legal, and should be. Police reports is a different matter, as they are confidential, but we're not really at the point right now where it is worth the effort of publishing anything on this.

Muito do que me afligia estava ligado em como esses meus motivos não pareciam aplicáveis à *vida real*. Na maior parte do tempo era como se minha mente me dissesse que eu estava na trajetória correta mas ao mesmo tempo algo não parecia *encaixar*. Era um tanto quanto frustrante não me reconhecer nos ideais dos quais tudo indicavam serem os ""certos"" (em âmbitos financeiros, de relacionamentos, etc). Desde sempre nunca vi necessidade de buscar um caminho que me gerasse rios de dinheiro, ou que eu deveria ter como ideai alguém 'capa de revista', coisas do tipo.. e não só isso, mas coisas pequenas.

Pois bem, quando comecei a ler sobre budismo comecei a assimilar a forma da qual tudo era apresentado. Em como não temos controle do que nos é externo, em como não podemos no culpar/pressionar/martirizar pelo que não está nas nossas mãos. Saber que toda nossa experiência está diretamente relacionado ao nosso posicionamento em relação à nos mesmos e em como esse autoconhecimento nos habilita a sermos pessoas mais felizes consigo mesmo e, de tabela, uma pessoa que exerce um papel mais positivo e construtivo na vida dos outros.

Tudo isso me ajudou bastante em diversas situações típicas de dia-a-dia. Me guiou em um caminho mais empático (comigo e com todo o resto), tornou minha vida mais agradável. Antes, muita coisa me era confusa.. por exemplo, já tive diversas brigas com ex namoradas por elas se queixarem de eu não ser ciumento, de não ser um desse caras psicóticos, como se isso fosse sinônimo de amor. Era confuso argumentar nesses casos, me questionava se eu realmente estava correto de respeitar o outro ao ponto de confiar dessa forma. E até hoje sou assim, aprendi que essa queixa está mais relacionada a como as pessoas se sentem valorizadas do que de fato ""eu estar errado"".

Não comentei no post mas li bastante sobre a psicologia de alguns desses conflitos interpessoais, em especial relacionamentos abusivos. Todos essas coisas das quais influenciavam de um jeito ou de outro a minha vida eu fiz questão de entender melhor. No fim tudo foi se encaixando aos poucos. Aprendi a entender melhor os outros e a mim mesmo, o que eu deveria procurar e o que evitar.

Como comentei antes, abstraí a parte mais avançada por não ser o que procurava. Não quero me tornar um monge, não sinto a necessidade de me afastar de tudo que é terreno. Porém todo o resto me ajudou consideravelmente a melhorar e formalizar tudo o que eu sentia e também de entender e tratar as causas de várias coisas que me incomodavam nesse âmbito existencial.

I do think the FDA goes overboard. So many drugs work just fine in Europe and other places and never get approved here for very little reason. Clinical trials take much longer than they really need to, things that are 99% the same are treated as totally different. The best example is insulin pumps ""this pump is 99% the same as the older model with this one added feature"". These kind of things should just get a quick review from an expert not employed by the company and go to market. Instead the FDA dicks around for years getting them approved.

A good analogy I'd make is helicopter parenting. Just because one out of every 100 million helicopter parents happens to catch bowel cancer because they routinely examine the stool of their 10 year old doesn't mean the practice is healthy. Just like with parenting, I think there needs to be a balance between regulation and not impeding innovation.

Nice folks too, and helpful--they really know their stuff.  They used to have a collection of business cards from customers next to the counter, and most of the highly-respected chefs and restaurants and artisanal food producers in town were represented.

I'd always assumed I was paying more there for the quality, until I did the math.  I got into an argument with somebody about that (he said stores like World Spice were only for ""snooty gourmets"" who liked to waste money).  So I priced grocery store spices vs. World Spice, and the results were staggering.

You're tip-toeing through the blurred lines that separate Cinderella stories from great fortune, and you're holding one of the most commonly known ""average managers"" on the highest pedestal because he was a part of a team that we will sing about for decades to come. I'm all for giving him credit, but please, for the love of god, don't hold him on a higher pedestal than Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho just because he won his first career title last season with a team that truly deserved it. Just like I will never rate Robbie Di Matteo higher than Arsene Wenger, I will never go out and name Claudio Reineri as a world class manager for having more Premier League titles than all of Liverpool's managers combined. It's a team effort, and while managers and coaching staffs do earn a lot of credit for each of those victories, they aren't, by any sense of the imagination, any more than a part of the team. 

What separates one manager from another is their accumulated career merits, the aesthetic, reputation, and swagger of which they carry, and all the confidence they instill in every team they step into. One great season will never erase what Claudio did as Greece manager. One great season will never overwrite his time in Italy, or all those times he settled for second because he couldn't handle a title race. 

I will absolutely always, without fail, be thankful for that time he got us into Europe, and ushered in a new era for Chelsea, and for that, I'll always respect him and genuinely hold the door open to the prospect of him rejoining us in one medium or the next (i.e.: coach, manager; or advisor).

&gt;Só que a lógica dos serviços básicos não pode ser a do lucro, porque todos precisam de acesso aos serviços básicos

Justamente por isso que *é preciso* que haja disputa por lucro, apenas a concorrência garante o acesso e a qualidade. A Venezuela tentou fazer justamente o que você disse - limitar o lucro porque ""serviço básico nao pode dar lucro"" e olha no que deu.

&gt;Só porque o nosso estado é ineficiente não quer dizer que a solução privada é ideal; o ideal é tornar o estado eficiente.

Right, ""dessa vez, os políticos certos estarão no poder!"". O controle centralizado do governo é intrinsicamente ineficiente comparado com o controle descentralizado do mercado.

&gt;* The Bradford taxi driver had believed Mr Shah - who belonged to the persecuted Ahmadi sect - had committed blasphemy by claiming to be a prophet in a series of incoherent youtube videos.

&gt;* The rally at Ahmed's family home was organised by the anti-blasphemy group called Labaik Ya Rasool Ullah (Here I am present, o Prophet of Allah).

&gt;* Rizvi's group has also championed another killer - Mumtaz Qadri - who in 2011 shot dead a high profile Pakistani politician for trying to reform the country's blasphemy laws.

&gt;* Last year the imam at Glasgow Central Mosque, Habib ur Rehman, was revealed by The Herald to have called Qadri a ""true Muslim"" in an exchange on messaging service Whatsapp.

&gt;* Ahmadis in Scotland have become increasingly alarmed over events in Pakistan and have accused some mainstream Sunni Muslims of spreading bigotry from the subcontinent in to Europe.

&gt;As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I’m most often asked is ‘How fast would that SR-71 fly?’ I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It’s an interesting question, given the aircraft’s proclivity for speed, but there really isn’t one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute.

&gt;Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed.. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual ‘high’ speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn’t previously seen.

&gt;So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, ‘What was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?’ This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and I relayed the following.

&gt;I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England, with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refuelling over the North Sea, we proceeded to find the small airfield.

&gt;Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field-yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn’t see it. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren’t really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane levelled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass.

&gt;Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn’t say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet’s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of ‘breathtaking’ very well that morning and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach.

&gt;As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn’t spoken a word since ‘the pass.’ Finally, Walter looked at me and said, ‘One hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?’ Trying to find my voice, I stammered, ‘One hundred fifty-two.’ We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, ‘Don’t ever do that to me again!’ And I never did.

&gt;A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer’s club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, ‘It was probably just a routine low approach; they’re pretty impressive in that plane.’ ",t5_2qhsa,,dednw48,t3_5wvm7x,

In many places, two of us found an apartment with a full kitchen for not much more than two of us would stay in a hostel. If you're willing to walk or take public transit, you can easily stay at cheaper apartments outside of the main sights.

Budapest was absolutely beautiful, but I fear Prague is starting to feel too much like a tourist trap. It's pretty enough but packed with people and tacky shops. It just didn't feel authentic, and access to the historic areas is often only accessible with (relatively) pricey tickets.

For my money, I would skip Prague and do Budapest, Ljubljana (Slovenia is gorgeous, I would live there), Sarajevo (the city just has so much soul, and was such a different experience from so many other cities we visited), and if you have time, the coast of Croatia is beautiful.

Krakow is... important. Going to Auschwitz and Birkenau is sobering, intense, and (IMO) an important experience as a fellow member of the human race. Plus, you can get kielbasa from the sausage man who shows up at night at the Hala Targowa market. If you're hikers, Tatra National Park is just a couple hours south of Krakow (busses run regularly) and has some of the best hiking we did on our year-long trip.

Paris was lovely. Florence was not our favorite, but that was mostly because it was so packed with tourists that it was hard to have a moment to enjoy your surroundings. Ironically, Rome, though it has more tourists in the main areas, was more enjoyable because the density of archeological digs and old buildings meant that turning down any old street was likely to present you with something cool.

I'm not trying to self-promote, so if you want to do some reading on our blog where we explored a lot of Europe (and Asia, and Australia, and New Zealand), just message me. We spent a year traveling.

Even [Trump](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/306990-trump-appeared-to-register-eight-companies-in-saudi-arabia) has ties to Saudi Arabia, which should be of far more concern than any dealings he has with Russia. 

&gt;There is wayyy too much shit connecting Trump to Russia.

No. There is nothing connecting Trump to Russia in the capacity of him being a Russian sleeper agent sent to destroy America from within. There are stories from a handful of news companies all beholden to the same shareholders telling you, without offering any evidence, exactly what you want to believe. Not a single piece of evidence has been shown aside from allegations. If there is evidence, where is it? Christopher Steele's dossier is all there is and much of it comes from 4chan. If allegations are enough to prove something, then as I've shown, the past administration is guilty of arming and aiding one of the foremost sponsors of terror in the world and a leading human rights violator.

&gt;Why does Trump always suck up to Putin?

The media created a situation where Trump has two choices: condemn and attack Russia for no reason to appease ""Liberals"" who, ironically, cry incessantly about how they want world peace, *or* try to build a fruitful relationship just like Hillary Clinton and Obama did [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sudCmrAsF4) and [here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-clinton-foundation-state-and-kremlin-connections-1469997195). I mean, what do *you* want Trump to do? [Condemn Russia for Ukraine](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/world/europe/nikki-haley-trump-ukraine-russia-putin.html)? Go to war with Russia? Why?

""Well Putin hates gays---""

So do the Saudis.

""Well, putin violates human rights---""

So do the Saudis, Chinese, and many of our other allies.

""Well, Putin spies on the USA!""

You mean like [Israel](http://www.newsweek.com/2014/05/16/israel-wont-stop-spying-us-249757.html) does?

Exactly why should we be hostile toward Russia if our allies are equal to, or worse than Russia?
  
&gt;Why does all consevatives[sic] suddenly love Russia

Again, the choice is join in with the mindless ""Liberal"" lunacy, or not. By not joining in, you say they ""love"" Russia. Was it the Conservatives who had a transfer of technologies initiative with Russia? Did the Conservatives work out a [uranium](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html) deal with Russia? 

&gt;I dare Trump to tweet a single criticism of Putin

Why should Trump go toe-to-toe with a world power we need in the battle against ISIS to appease uninformed Americans being whipped into a mob-like frenzy by media outlets they believe without question? 

&gt;Why did he turn off recording when talking to Putin from the White House?

Why didn't we hear every conversation Obama had with Putin? Moreover, the point you are attempting to make is they must've been discussing some secret plan... Why? Why would they discuss a secret plan over the White House phone? Certainly Putin, being the mastermind he is, has some other way for his Manchurian Candidate sleeper agent to contact him about their secret plans without having to use the White House switchboard.

&gt;Oh, and Trump's son already has said there are a lot of business connections

And? One of the most well known businessmen in the world isn't going to have ties to the world's fifth largest economy? If doing business with Russia makes one guilty of being a Russian sleeper agent, lookup the [Podesta Group](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/podesta-group-paul-manafort-russia-ukraine-227215)'s connections to Russian companies. Paul Manafort, who left the Trump administration over his ties to Ukraine, has ties to the very same people in Ukraine that the Podesta Group has ties to. Podesta also sat on the board of Joule Unlimited, a Massachusetts-based energy company; its holding company, Joule Global Holdings, N.V., is based in the Netherlands; and Joule Global Stichting, which is the controlling entity, was a client of [Mossack Fonseca](http://www.wnd.com/2016/09/hsbc-case-blows-lid-on-clintons-offshore-empire/) of the ""Panamanian Papers"" scandal. The Russian company Rusnano has invested billions of rubles in Joule. According to Joule's executives, John Podesta was given his position because of his ""considerable expertise...in the realm of public policy as well as partnering with the public sector.""  So, if Donald Trump is guilty of being a Russian agent because of *his* ties to Russia, why aren't John Podesta or any of the Democrats with ties to Russia under equal scrutiny?

Because you don't care. You don't really believe the Russian thing, it's just something you can throw around to get back at Trump. Rather than use the political process against the Trump administration, which takes time and thought, it's easier to sit online and peddle conspiracy theories to overcompensate for all the conspiracy theories that were thrown at Obama. Not a single piece of evidence has been presented that proves Donald Trump is a Russian sleeper agent installed to destroy America. However, we do have a considerable amount of evidence that links the previous administration to terrorist regimes that have attacked the United States and its allies.

Because the Left is incapable of getting over their loss, because this rhetoric is going to continue for the next four years, the Democrats are going to lose again. It's actually pretty incredible because it would be rather easy to beat Trump, but alas it's easier to cry, point fingers, blame, and make-up stories. This should be the time for the Democrats to regroup and focus on how to win, instead they are going to get beaten again. This is why I've left the party. I'm done with the party, not only because their leadership is detached from reality, but because of comment threads like these that highlight how the opposition would rather disseminate conspiracy theories than actually do something constructive. The Democrats have no idea what they are doing.

See for example Liebeschuetz's 'Making a Gothic History: Does the Getica of Jordanes Preserve Genuinely Gothic Traditions?' (2011):

&gt; That the myths did indeed have some historical basis is suggested by the fact
&gt; that Ptolemy located Gutai on the island of Scandia (that is, in Scandinavia),
&gt; and that Strabo and Tacitus place a people known as Gutones, whose name
&gt; suggests that they may be identical with, or perhaps only related to the Gutai,
&gt; along the Vistula, in today’s Poland.These passages, which have been much
&gt; discussed, do suggest that the process of evolution, the ethnogenesis, of our
&gt; Goths took place along the geographical route that the Goths remembered
&gt; in their legends. It is extremely unlikely that the Goths, or indeed other Germanic
&gt; gentes within the empire, had no recollection whatsoever of their earlier
&gt; history and culture.

But this evidence remains tricky:

&gt; Myths and legends do not of give us an accurate picture of historical
events. The French-speaking Normans who conquered England were already
very diff erent from their Norse-speaking Viking ancestors. Orally transmitted
myth may be based on history but it also transforms it. The Nibelungenlied
has merged Attila the king of the Huns and Aëtius the Roman general; and
Dietrich von Bern of German legend is scarcely recognizable as his historic
counterpart the great Theoderic, nor does the detail of the Heidrek Saga bear
much resemblance to what Jordanes tells us about the wars between Huns
and Goths in the fifth century. But most of these legends after all have a traceable
link to historical events, even if they involve the fusion of several folk
memories in the course of ethnogenesis. The Gothic myths too are likely to be
unreliable guides as to what actually happened, although this need not mean
that Scandinavian origin and the migration across eastern Europe must be
totally rejected.

If I may, allow me to expand on my argument above, as in retrospect I did not discuss this in enough detail. Legends, as defended here by Liebeschuetz, are always flexible and whilst I do not doubt that there were kernels of historical reality behind the stories, how can we tell the difference? Liebeschuetz does not reject a Scandinavian origin and argues that some traditions reported by Jordanes were genuine, but I would suggest that this is not enough, as traditions constantly change and were reinvented over time (see also the excellent post on the invention of traditions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5wfvwm/monday_methods_eric_hobsbawm_and_the_invention_of/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=AskHistorians)). When there is only one source, it is impossible to try to separate the embellishments from the traditional 'core'. The archaeological evidence is difficult to understand too, as a shared material culture does not necessarily mean that the people involved had a shared identity or culture; at the very least, this claim needs to involve a lot more evidence, beyond archaeology, to be watertight.

Personally (and based on a quick look, for Kulikowski too), I would argue that mobility was an ever-present part of the ancient world and the formation of a Gothic confederation in the third century no doubt involved a great deal of movement. Some of the people involved may well have come from Scandinavia, but I am wary about describing the entire group as of Scandinavian origin, since the label given in the sources do not describe the much more complicated reality (for more on the dangers of groupism, [this Monday Methods post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5sdefc/monday_methods_what_in_the_world_is_groupism/) is superb). Centuries had passed by then, so I'm not really sure if we should emphasise their myths when their contemporary social, political and cultural situation would have had more consequences for the average 'Goth'.

Every single midterm since the Hoover administration, with the exceptions of the great depression, 9/11, and Clintons impeachment.

Since the election, democrats overperformed in the DE and CT legislatures. They almost won the most conservative seat in CT. Small donors have raised over a million in a GA Congressional race.

when different people sign up (north american players, first-timers, and players coming back because they find this mini-season in particular to be interesting), it's setting up for a great thing in the future; i bet you a lot of those will get accustomed to european tagpro, mumble, and subreddit, so when time for the new regular season comes, they won't hesitate to sign up for it. 

the best thing we could do right now to help eltp as a whole, is to lure more people in from north america who're willing to play more competitive than just mltp and fill the void. so many nltp and mltp players get only a few halves of gameplay a season, if not none at all. they could find a place for them in novice, or whatever division suits them. maybe then we could break the 200 sign-ups barrier.

There is no direct ""real world counterpart"" for each civilization in *The Lord of the Rings*.

&gt;It was intended to be a mythohistory of Britain.

I'm not at all sure how that is related to what we're discussing, and more importantly, it isn't really true.. *The Book of Lost Tales* (which would later become *The Silmarillion*) was originally intended to be a British Myth that would be relayed through the construct of a mariner named Aelfwine. Tolkien abandoned this idea before *The Lord of the Rings* was written, deciding that it would rather be a series of stories set in a mythological prehistoric Europe. It became less directly related to England (although Britain was certainly not forgotten.)

## A esquerda que aprovou a publicação das listas de devedores ao fisco e à Segurança Social, recusa agora informar quem deve aos contribuintes, via CGD, porque são os empresários amigos dos governos PS.

Comecemos por agradecer às divindades terem bafejado o nosso retângulo com tanta perspicácia. Nos últimos dias fizeram-nos obséquio de noticiarem que os homens heterossexuais desejam mulheres, perdão, que houve transferências, dentro do sistema bancário e com todos os registos, entre Portugal e *offshores* durante o governo PSD-CDS. (A propósito: se tiverem um assomo de rebeldia, sintam-se à vontade para noticiar o montante das transferências semelhantes ocorridas já no tempo novo da geringonça.)

A notícia de que a melhor lição sobre assobios veio de Lauren Bacall, desculpem, de que há transferências para paraísos fiscais, e a maioria dos comentários sobre esta magna questão, vieram em tom apropriado. Foi dito e escrito que milhões, ‘escaparam ao fisco’, que ‘fugiram’ para *offshores*. Fugiram, tal qual os meliantes que há dias fugiram da prisão de Caxias pela janela. Marotos dos milhões, que saíram à socapa (os registos todos não interessam) do sítio onde tinham a obrigação ética e legal de se manterem sossegados. Pior: estas transferências não foram tratadas pela AT, apesar de terem sido ‘denunciadas’ (juro que li num jornal) pelos bancos. Denunciadas – assim como se denuncia um vizinho que bate na mulher.

Políticos de esquerda não quiseram que uns poucos jornalistas fizessem más figuras sem companhia, e comentaram o dinheiro que saiu como se, em vez de dinheiro de privados, fosse dinheiro tirado às contas do Estado. (E ainda dizemos que Trump é que é viciado em mentiras.) O sempre infeliz (e desleixado com a verdade) Costa também falou em milhões que ‘fugiram’. É que nem é necessário, para estes lunáticos, verificar se as transações são legais. É dar ideia de que é mesmo dinheiro tirado aos serviços à população carenciada, para engrossar contas anafadas de corruptos de direita. Vergonha na cara e medo do ridículo, RIP.

Bom, digam lá: não tinham saudades, já há uns tempos, de incentivos deste calibre à inveja, à ignorância e ao ressentimento social?

Regressemos dos meandros de, no mínimo, açúcar em excesso onde estas conspirações fervilham. Até agora, e certamente não foi por falta de investigação jornalística (ou será que depois de feito o alarido perderam o interesse?), as transações para *offshores* não indiciam fuga aos impostos (escrevo antes das audições aos SEF). (Quem fugiria aos impostos através de transferências bancárias claras, cujo registo fica lavrado no sistema e são declaradas aos serviços fiscais?)

Pelo que, segundo o que até agora se viu, tratam-se de transferências legítimas de pessoas e empresas que movem o seu dinheiro licitamente ganho de um lado para outro, e de empresas que pagam a fornecedores com contas bancárias em *offshores*. É, para mim, intolerável que movimentações destas, aparentemente legítimas, sejam apresentadas como crimes de lesa-pátria só porque sim, porque somos um país pequeno e mesquinho que odeia pessoas ricas e torce o nariz socialista ao capitalismo. ‘Denunciar’, para repúdio generalizado da populaça, estes ‘milhões que fugiram’ é um perigo público vindo de quem pretende restringir a liberdade de cada um dispor do seu dinheiro como lhe convém. É defesa de uma ideologia proto comunista onde o dinheiro pertence ao coletivo, ao Estado, em vez de ao proprietário, pelo que não pode ser transferido para fora do país. Só se pedirmos encarecidamente e nos derem, com ar reprovador, autorização.

O que interessa investigar, nos responsáveis políticos como nos burocratas, é o apagão da AT com estas transações, tendo em conta que importuna os contribuintes (sobretudo quem não tem dinheiro para pagar a advogados e ripostar) por tostões. Ou por que razão o governo Sócrates tornou supostamente obrigatórias estas estatísticas, se afinal não eram obrigatórias mas sim dependentes de validação política? O gosto nacional por quinze patamares de vistos burocráticos não espicaça a denúncia? Nem os abusos das autoridades fiscais e dos políticos da tutela? Legislar de forma confusa para permitir todo o tipo de interpretações também é pacífico?

Já as transferências para as *offshores*, em si mesmas, parecem tão inquietantes como um comprimido de valeriana. E a não publicação das estatísticas sobre elas foi tão rotundamente grave que ninguém reparou que não apareceram.

Claro que este não-assunto *offshores* é muito mais escandaloso (desmaios, se faz favor) que a recusa de se dar informações dos devedores em incumprimento à CGD (i.e., aos contribuintes), apoiada em peso pela esquerda. Se os jornalistas das *offshores* quiserem, eu dou explicações sobre isto. A esquerda que aprovou (com Sócrates) a publicação das listas de devedores ao fisco e à Segurança Social, recusa agora informar quem deve aos contribuintes, via CGD, pela razão óbvia: quem deve à AT e à SS são contribuintes da ralé e PME indiferenciadas; já [quem deve à CGD](http://observador.pt/2016/06/14/caixa-tem-23-mil-milhoes-de-euros-em-risco-quem-deve-mais/) são os empresários amigos dos governos PS, incluindo [aqueles](https://www.publico.pt/2008/01/04/economia/noticia/joe-berardo-e-aliados-compraram-accoes-do-bcp-com-credito-da-caixa-1315596) que votaram na administração do BCP engendrada por Sócrates depois da CGD lhes ter financiado [compras de ações várias](https://ionline.sapo.pt/428731). Se os devedores fossem revelados, ainda ficávamos a saber para que serve um banco público.

Termino com sugestão de notícias para os jornalistas, tão intrigantes como transferências de dinheiro registadas. A propensão das senhoras para usarem estampados florais na primavera. Quantas calorias tem uma pizza. Se ousarem um registo mais sério, podem noticiar que temos eleições legislativas de quatro em quatro anos. Ou, dado que, perante este cenário, qualquer pessoa com neurónios funcionais coloca o seu dinheiro longe – e proteger de abusos socializantes poupanças e capital é, para mim, um direito inalienável – noticiem o surpreendente: distraídos que ainda conservam o seu dinheiro no país, ao alcance de socialistas radicais de espécies sortidas.",t5_3j11u,,dedr3v9,t3_5wybiw,

**Public toilets:**  Wikipedia has an [article about pay toilets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_toilet).  I looked at it.  Here's some of what I learned:  Pay toilets can be found on the Paris metro, as well as in bus and rail stations in the United Kingdom.  It sounds like it's fine to install pay toilets in Europe, but politically unacceptable in parts of America.  In fact, it's illegal to install pay toilets in certain American jurisdictions, including Chicago.  I dunno about Salt Lake City.

&gt; Ceea ce îmi bate la ochi e însă faptul că toți reclamă doar ceea ce s-a întâmplat după 2013, adică după ce a venit Kövesi la DNA, asupra celor patru ani de protocol de dinainte planând o tăcere binevoitoare. Pasămite, atunci erau cu toții niște sfinți legaliști.

apropo [recent](http://www.ziuaconstanta.ro/stiri/justitie/ccr-transferul-unui-imobil-de-la-ra-apps-la-sri-s-a-facut-cu-incalcarea-unei-hotarari-judecatoresti-624831.html) de decizia ccr vizavi de ponta care dadea ilegal prin oug un imobil sriului. Nu era binom atunci.

&gt;Dar cum informația vine de la un ziarist pe ca­re îl respect, Dan Tăpălagă, evident că mă pu­ne pe gânduri. Tocmai de aceea mă și în­treb cum de procurorii care au sesizat „mica invazie“ și transformarea DNA în „secția pe­nală a SRI“ (sintagmă folosită, ce coin­ci­den­ță!, de Cristoiu, Băsescu, Tăriceanu și alții din armata de care vorbeam) au suportat stoic vreme de trei ani cel puțin așa o grozăvie? Îmi închipui că nu le-a fost ușor. Au ieșit acum din motive de „oportunitate“ sau pen­tru că, post factum, nu-i lasă conștiința pro­fesională să doarmă noaptea?

Tapalaga o manca din ce mananca si  Pippidi. Cristoiu in [2014](http://www.evz.ro/romania-lui-cristoiu-mineriada-anti-justitie-a-tandemului-dan-voiculescu-victor-ponta-a-fost-stopata-deocamdata-doar.html) chiar acuza PSDul ca da mineriada antijustitie ( are o obsesie cu cuvantul mineriada). Dupa vreo juma de an cand incep si alte probleme pt cine nu trebe se [suceste](http://www.cristoiublog.ro/gindul-de-breaking-news-prin-dna-divizia-sa-penala-sri-ii-da-sah-lui-traian-basescu/) si incep reevaluarile. Apropo la doar 2 luni a plecat Maior de la SRI cam fara motiv si fortat ca si cum vroia de urgenta sa plece. Dupa aia a fost linie verde pt toate vuvuzelele sa puna tunurile pe SRI. As banui ca era o reactie dupa ce s-au stricat niste planuri dand chix finul lui Maior la prezidentiale.

&gt;Dar, până la ur­mă, indiferent de motivație, n-ar fi oare mai bine să facă ei un raport scris, cu nume, do­sare și niscaiva dovezi de denunțători, „pe ca­re-i găseam martori protejați în unele dosare și inculpați în altele“ la procurorul general (ca­re, în interviul pe care mi l-a acordat, spune că-i așteaptă cu brațele deschise), ca să lă­mu­rim chestiunea și să curățăm puroiul? Că altfel, să avem pardon, pot să cred că o fi vreun ordin pe unitate, că tot face furori zi­ce­rea, sau, doamne ferește, vreun război per­so­nal, o bătălie pentru vreun scaun. ( * se refera la base care zicea ca e doar lupta pt putere si nu e vrun pericol pt lupta anticoruptie) Că alte sur­se spun că asta ar cam fi treaba de fapt.

It is a form of socialism, the definition literally says ""a socialist system of government achieved by democratic means."", so it is socialist, why would I not? That's like me saying only the bad parts of capitalism ""count"" in my mind, just because I want to hate them. It's hypocritical. You seem to be bending the rules of socialism to your liking even more here. No success? Cuba's healthcare and education systems have been reformed for the better. Russia (only socialist in the form of redistribution of wealth) went from a feudalistic battered country, to a world power in a few decades. 

There are 3 major ""tenets"" to socialism; redistribution of wealth, democratic control over the means of production, and centralised economic control and distribution. You can look at a lot of places in Western Europe with it's well regulated economy ensuring quality, price, and access to important products for everyone, high levels of wealth equality, and a combination of both progressive and democratic electoral systems, and state-ownership of many businesses in significant industries to the populace (mining, oil, energy, banking, transport) and say ""BUT IT'S NOT REEL SOCIALISM"" all you like, but it most definitely hits all 3 core beliefs of socialism. The name being scary to you because of a few corrupted examples doesn't mean anything. Calling it socialism doesn't make it socialism, not calling it socialism doesn't make it not socialism, you actually have to look at the theory and compare. Europe today matches socialist theory far more than Soviet Russia did.

&gt;And yes, some Socialist politicians where electorally successful, but Socialism overall enjoyed rather limited popular support in most countries (and even countries who indoctrinated Socialist propaganda, like Brazil or former Soviet Union countries).

So you are basing this off labels and scariness rather than actual theory? I knew it. No, *some* socialist politicians weren't successful, *lots* of socialist politicians are in power in some of the most powerful countries in the world, and even if they aren't they usually have a party somewhere. Oh, and I should also point out that the ""Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats"" are actually the second largest party in the European Parliament. Socialism shouldn't be a scary word anymore. Europe certainly isn't scared, it's actually thriving.

&gt;Along with a lot of other problems.

Name some

&gt;Maybe it sounds this way to you, but it is not what I tried to say and what I actually said. I said that the individual, and the individual alone, should decide where to work and where to invest, Socialists may still advocate for their system, but should not force anyone into that, removing choices.

There doesn't need to be any force, it's an ideal. Just like ancaps thrive towards destroying the state and allowing capitalism total control over every industry, including the law. I'd complain about that, doesn't mean I'd be able to go back to how things are. Both are unrealistic. That's why I'm a state-socialist. I think the government should be investing in important industries to ensure control over these significant goods and services, just like what already happens across Europe to many different industries. EDF, the French state-owned energy company, is providing 22% of the EU's energy right now. That's socialism in action through the state. ",t5_3cct3,DemocraticSocialist,deds27y,t3_5wpxtp,

First of all, it won't ever use 4gb of vram in Overwatch. On top of that, Overwatch has input lag when your graphics card is under moderate load, even when it's not reflected in your fps. I would definitely recommend going 480 4gb over a 470 8gb. Especially since you can get one for around the same price that you listed for your 470. (I'll edit a link in a bit)

Also, Overwatch is kind of CPU intensive, and you'll probably be bottlenecked pretty heavily by the g4560. You probably want to consider an i5 for consistently good Overwatch performance. 

Also also, Overwatch benefits a lot from faster ram (unlike any other game that I know of) so it would probably be beneficial to go for 2 4gb sticks so you can get that 2-channel speed bonus.

Also also also, if you DO go with an Asus ROG GPU, you need to [disable a thing or it will cause lag in Overwatch.](https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/17611631017)",t5_2rnve,,dedst6v,t3_5wr4wg,

I'm not seeing this as something that has to be ratified straightaway.  That whilst the UK will leave in 2 years the actual real reform after transcribing EU law into UK law will be closer to...maybe 10?  

That's the sort of timescale Ken Clarke's former adviser considered it  (Tim Congdon -admittedly always pro leave).

&gt;we will be forced to compete directly with tax havens etc. Giant multinationals will have huge leverage, especially in our vulnerable state as we try to rebuild things.

Giant multinationals are always driven by their smaller margins of profit, so the margin of disparity only has to be smaller still.

That said, and again I appreciate we're probably coming from  opposed aspects of the spectrum, whilst I'm not exactly for a total tax haven....well, you'll get my meaning....

&gt;we will be forced to compete directly with tax havens etc. Giant multinationals will have huge leverage,...

I cut your quote off a little early there.  Purposely.  For the bit I agreed with.

Again I understand what you're saying.  But cutting marginally below the competition was part of my ethos for supporting Leave.  I wanted Brexit not because of what was promised (although I did) but for what I thought the compensation to offset it would mean.

I'm not even in the norm, I spend half my time and business in the EZ.

&gt;Within a larger union we're more insulated from tax competition meaning greater opportunities to organise a tax regime that's optimal for growth and society.

I see the exact opposite, in that I think we're more insulated from EU tax rulings outside the union, and able to be even more dynamic.  

ANYWAYS,

We disagree.

&gt;&gt;Over the course of three albums for Warner Brothers in the 1990s, Mr. Bungle created music that defied description. Borrowing from avant-garde jazz, ska, metal, and pop, the Northern California band intrigued critics and created a large cult following. Ernest Agbuya in Chart Attack described ""the baffling vocals of Patton who, by turns, wails like an Eastern-European gypsy, [and] croons, screeches and gurgles,"" and suggested that this was a band that fit in no category. Mr. Bungle also entertained audiences by wearing masks and costumes, and gained a reputation for its bizarre stage shows. ""It's hard to describe Mr. Bungle's music,"" wrote Adam Levy in Guitar Player, ""any other way than 'bizarre.'""

In countries like these, when there's enough unrest that they decide to adopt a new constitution, those in power get to stay in power (mostly) and the government can hobble along until it can regroup.

The United States is different. When the 13 (former) colonies wrote the US constitution, the question was ""We need to create a country, what form should it take?""

Let's talk Syria, The Turkish Highway, the EU, ""AUSTERITY!"", Brexit, 

the Dem ""FUCK THE POORS!"" argument with tRump Hysteria, and in the words of another user, let me quote:

&gt; And shitty as Trump is and will be, at least so far he has not called for a no-fly zone in Syria and military responses to alleged Russian hacking. He may yet, but those were already staples of Clinton's plan, particularly regime change in Syria.

&gt; I get seriously angry when I read comments like, ""We can't let Russia get away with this."" When referring to them supporting Syria. Get away with fucking what? Russia was asked to help. They are allies for decades. We are not the fucking world police that two sovereign nations must ask our permission to work together to overthrow an insurrection. I don't think Assad is a nice guy. I'd rather the country was like Canada in the desert. But Assad is a democratically elected dictator with great popular support. Who the fuck are we to say he has to go?

&gt; I know the answer is we are an oligarchy - controlled by big banks and military contractors who want to get rid of Syria's sovereign bank and run a gas pipeline that we like (as opposed to the one preferred by Syria) - pretending to be a democracy and pretending that we are doing this for humanitarian reasons. 

&gt; Just like Libya, where it all worked out so well. Or Assad is a danger so we have to remove him, just like in Iraq. Or he's supporting/hiding terrorists, just like in Afghanistan. 

So: while some may attempt to pretend whatever they would like to, and think there's fodder for opinion-turning, we know better than to frame it like that.  We certainly can not.  

No one can afford to do so, actually.  We're not pretending, anything.  Actually.  

Here's another:  this is mine.

That ole ""Austerity!"" argument, too? If you follow the money? It often leads to many more answers.

This would be one arm of the Vampire Squid that comes from OldGOP and OldBigOil and the sauds and other, monied, interests.

And Trump's push to increase military spending? Is right now, a boon and goon to those ""Monied Interests"" -

Personally, I don't think the ban on halal meat (""turk ka maas"" in early rehitnama literature) has anything to do with ritualism of the procedure, and the argument from unnecessary suffering doesn't apply to the vast majority of halal meat in the U.K. since stunning ensures (or at least it's supposed to when properly carried out) that the animal is instantly rendered unconscious before slaughter. However modern stunning techniques did not exist during the Guru's time period, so it made sense to forbid the halal method on ethical grounds since there's good evidence to suggest the halal method does not minimise pain, contrary to the link you post. This meta-study covers the relevant evidence: http://www.dialrel.eu/images/veterinary-concerns.pdf

Of course, the prohibition was also motivated by anti-Mughal sentiments; unsurprisingly, the early Sikhs boycotted other immoral Mughal traditions too (i.e. hookah). I personally don't mind eating halal meat, but I acknowledge its prohibition for the Khalsa and would certainly avoid it after taking Amrit. 

To answer your other questions: 

1) Although the Sikh Gurus and many Sufis had mutual respect (Baba Farid's bani is included in SGGS for example), and Guru Arjan Dev Ji was very close to Mian Mir, the historicity of the foundation stone anecdote is debatable. Sikh sources state that it was Guru Arjan Dev Ji who laid the foundation stone.

2) That quote is by Bhagat Kabir Ji, who was *definitely* not a Muslim. In fact, I'd say he's the most critical of Islam out of all the authors of SGGS, so I suspect that quote has been mistranslated. Here is what he says about Semitic books: 

&gt;ਛਾਡਿ ਕਤੇਬ ਰਾਮੁ ਭਜੁ ਬਉਰੇ ਜੁਲਮ ਕਰਤ ਹੈ ਭਾਰੀ ॥

&gt;Give up your holy books, and remember the Lord, you fool, and stop oppressing others so badly.

&gt;* The three men  an Afghan and two Pakistanis  had contested the validity of the March 2016 accord in a bid to avoid being sent back to Turkey from Greece.

&gt;* But the European Court of Justice on Tuesday ruled that the deal was made by leaders of European member states, which meant the court could not hear the case.

&gt;* The court does not have jurisdiction to rule on the lawfulness of an international agreement concluded by the member states, it said.

&gt;* Under the controversial deal, Ankara pledged to take back all illegal migrants landing in Greece in exchange for financial aid and eased EU visa rules for Turkish citizens.

I was at the end of this path, and I came to a clearing, and there was a lake, very secluded, and there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw, a beautiful woman, bathing herself. but she was crying...
I hesitated, watching, struck by her beauty. And also by how her presence; the delicate curve of her back, the dark sweep of her hair, the graceful length of her limbs, even her tears, added to the majesty of my surroundings. I felt my own tears burning behind my eyes, not in sympathy, but in appreciation of such a perfect moment.
She spied me before I could compose myself. But she didn't cry out. Instead our eyes held and she smiled, enigmatically, fresh tears still spilling down her cheeks. I was frozen. I knew nothing about this woman, and yet, as we stood on opposite sides of a pool of water, thousands of miles from my own home and everyone I had ever known, I felt the most intense connection. Not just to her, but to the earth, the sky, the water between us. And also to the entirety of mankind. As if she symbolized thousands of years of the human condition.
I wanted to go to her, to comfort her, to probe this feeling of belonging I had never encountered before. But I couldn't. Because I knew that if I spoke, if she spoke, that moment would be ruined. And I knew I would need the memory of that moment to carry me through the inevitable dark patches throughout my life.
And so I watched her lower her hand, turn, and slowly walk to the shore opposite me. The rest of her perfect form was gradually revealed to me, and I held my breath as I watched her disappear behind a copse of trees near the water.
I didn't follow her, in fact I turned around. I knew there was nothing else we could experience together that would be more perfect than that moment...and it still remains the most profound experience of my life""

One important part of it is that Jews were frequently the only minority around in Europe: other religious minorities were not allowed at all, and linguistic identity only starts becoming more important in the 18th and 19th centuries with the rise of nationalism. 

Jews were a ""middle man minority"", sometimes called a market-dominant minority. Again, in most parts of Europe, they and the gypsies were the only middleman minorities around.  I have a post on middle man minorities, especially those in the Ottoman Empire, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4485vi/why_was_it_that_christian_groups_in_the_ottoman/) that might interest you and one about [Jews as middlemen minorities here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3tc0zk/were_there_any_real_factors_that_contributed_to/cx6h9mx/?context=1). That latter one includes one of the clearest insights about middleman minorities (talking about Chinese money lenders in Southeast Asia of all things): in the pre-modern era, many people experienced class and capital relations in part as ethnic relations, as quoted there from James C. Scott, ""the Malay typically experiences the shopkeeper and the rice buyer not only as a creditor and wholesaler but as a person of another race and another religion"". I also strongly recommend Edna Bonanich's original article on Middle Man Minorities ([downloadable here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228270882_A_Theory_of_Middleman_Minorities)), as well as this very [short summary of the field](http://www.shsu.edu/~kmd007/documents/WinFSHD2Userskmd007ArticlesMiddlemenMinorities.pdf) which emphasizes how some of the dynamics that encourage middle man minorities to form are still at play in the US and Western Europe, where low rewards to human capital in the labor market seem to encourage entrepreneurship  (particularly noticeable with Asian minorities in the US) as well as the existence of ethnic enclaves and cultures of entrepreneurship within specific minority groups.  Others have written specifically on [Middle Man Minorities and genocide](http://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=13&amp;article=1023&amp;context=books&amp;type=additional).

You now seem to be arguing that s3 HRA is of no value here because none of the questionable provisions of the IPA could possibly be interpreted in a Convention-compliant way and thus an s4 declaration is the only remedy available under the HRA. That seems quite a jump given the opinions in *Ghaidan*, in particular Lord Steyn's comments regarding interpretation under s3 being the principal remedial measure of the HRA and a declaration under s4 being a last resort, and regarding the need to adopt a broad approach to interpretation rather than too literal a reading.

Now, I'm not a lawyer, and I fully acknowledge that maybe you just understand something I don't here.

On Instagram I follow someone called ""Americans for revolution"", basically a European (German?) socialist living in the US.

He recently visited Cuba, taking loads of pictures and talking with the locals, and noted how so many of them had smartphones such as Samsung S7s.

While internet in the country isn't easily available, it's not restricted compared to the likes of states such as the DPRK, and most Cubans just head to local libraries (which there are a lot of when your Govt. funds them) to get online.

Also Cubans aren't as materialistic since they're not exposed to advertising and consumer culture like Americans are, so it seems almost backwards to be outside playing rather than using phones and computers 24/7 (most of us are probably consumerist without wanting to be I presume).

Few other notes:

Education, healthcare, and housing are all free. All Cubans get a plot of land which they may choose to farm however they like. They keep 30% for themselves to eat or sell, and 70% given to authorities to distribute as needed throughout the country. You can find discussion everywhere about how cheap commodities are in Cuba, but in short they're *incredibly* cheap, even despite the Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC) being almost in parity with the Great British Pound (GBP) and Euro (EUR).

Should be enough to convince people even a little bit that Marxist economics can and *do* work, and not just work, but work *better* than Capitalist economies, which only benefit your GDP ""high score"" and piddly stock market points.",t5_2ukze,,dedzdih,t3_5vuoj0,

Battel had the backing of his superior officer, but didn't act on orders of the high command, whereas Itter took place after the war was already over. Arguably the attempted coup by Stauffenberg and other officers could be seen as a conflict since the SS was founded as Hitler's secret service. 

The 'clean Wehrmacht' is a myth that was pushed by right-wing apologists but it doesn't really depict the truth, since a lot of the atrocities in the Soviet union were commited by Wehrmacht troops or were at least orchestrated by the high command. Starving out the Russian population was part of the invasion plan, as were summary executions of political officers. The mistreatment of war criminals can also be attributed to the Wehrmacht. It was however possible to be a Wehrmacht soldier without participating in the massacres. The soldiers who carried these out were usually volunteers and to my knowledge no German who refused to participate was ever executed or even sanctioned for it. The political orientation was most certainly a lot less clear compared to the SS. While the army consisted of an mostly conervative/reactionary officer corps, the normal soldiers were conscripts from all layers of society and partially volunteers, the SS sought out to become a racially and politically pure elite force, whose members volunteer to join. As such they attracted the most fanatical and brutal recruits which enabled them to do things you couldn't expect a unit of regular soldiers to do. 

A Wehrmacht soldier might be a conscript who is generally a good person, trying to make the best out of his situation and not mistreating the occupied population, explaining the ""good memories"". Of course he could also sign up for every 'retaliation mission' against random villages. If you met an SS-member however you could be fairly sure that he is fully buying into the ideology and will be ready to carry the crimes out which he deems necessary. Since there was a lot more diversity in the Wehrmacht it is not surprising that their image is not as bad as the SS's. But this doesn't mean that the Wehrmacht was a 'good' or even 'decent' organization. If you contrast them to the SS they appear less horrible, but it should not be forgotten that the Wehrmacht commited war crimes over the entire course of WWII and was well aware that they were fighting a war of extermination. 

To quote Erich Hoepner, colonel general at the time(May '41):
""The war against Russia is an important chapter in the struggle for existence of the German nation. It is the old battle of Germanic against Slav peoples, of the defence of European culture against Muscovite-Asiatic inundation, and the repulse of Jewish-Bolshevism. The objective of this battle must be the destruction of present-day Russia and it must therefore be conducted with unprecedented severity. Every military action must be guided in planning and execution by an iron will to exterminate the enemy mercilessly and totally. In particular, no adherents of the present Russian-Bolshevik system are to be spared.""",t5_2qh53,,dee0knx,t3_5wygtl,

You are allowed to celebrate your European culture and heritage, and people won't get upset. It is when you diminish all reality from the situation by celebrating something so poorly defined, socially constructed and nebulous as your skin colour or the continent you came from.

Being proud to be European is meaningless. I'm not proud to be European, because that lumps me in with the people who spent centuries persecuting my ancestors. I'm proud to be Scottish, I'm proud to be Swiss-German and I'm proud to be Romani.

Since I don't know where you're from, I assume you're from an English-speaking country perhaps the UK and I am fairly certain there are more imported workers and ""guest workers"" who work cheap in your neck of the woods displacing a few here and there. Last I looked there were about 1 million UK workers living in EU countries outside the UK but more than three times as many EU workers living in the UK. But I digress.

Regardless of what you may think of my country or the guy it elected, you are way too judgmental about people and their circumstances and tend to generalize far too much. And that my friend is a handicap on your part. You forget each state has its own laws on divorce and the courts in those states are not as fair as perhaps the ones in your country.

And BTW, I personally am against globalism for the very same reasons you spouted out about: low worker wages, oppression and abuses against workers in foreign countries, and the exploitation of the underprivileged for profit. I am also against automation because then you will have far too many people mulling about, hungry and about to revolt against the system which may end up in a disaster for all governments.

But the one thing I do know: you cannot just generally blame a whole class of people or an entire nation by branding them with your own personal prejudices and then apply that to persons who are in a particular situation.

Not everyone got to go or gets to go to a college or university. Not everyone is privileged enough to get a great job that will last a lifetime and is export-proofed. 

ETA --

Maybe its the Cold War mentality that is stil hanging around in my memories, but I was raised at a time when America was looked to for help and we sure did help. We helped a lot. Now our policies may not have pleased a lot of people, but heck, France got France back from the Germans, and Germany finally got Germany back from the Russians, and Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and a host of other nations got their countries back from the Germans and the Russians. What can I say? Europe has been at war with itself for a long, long time. And in Asia warlords controlled huge swaths of real estate. But I digress. This is how much EU countries contribute to NATO.

UK is 65 million
DE is 83 million
FR is 76 million

28 member states of NATO only 3 EU's pay for the nearly 1 trillion dollar annual budget. The rest is paid by Americans.

US pays 72 - 75%. The remainder of the paying countries are UK, DE and FR. Their combined contribution is roungly 25 - 27 percent of NATO's budget. Of the EU paying countries, all have free higher education and national health services. If you combine domestic defense spending in the US and NATO spending by the US it tops 1.3 trillion dollars. Now that does not include funding for the ANZUS budgets which are also reputed to be in the 500 billion dollar range annually (but that also includes foreign aid to Australia [NZ withdrew from ANZUS], Japan and a host of other nations operating in the area, including the UK, FR, and some other former colonials. AU has its own national health service and free higher education. And it relies heavily on US military forces.

So you can see, the US has been subsidizing free education and healthcare in at least 3 EU countries for 70 years by diverting their spending on national defense towards social programs which also kept taxes low in these places (there was at one time a 90 percent tax). Oh not to mention Canada doesn't pay anything and they have a national health service and free higher education too. So add CA to the mix. Our neighbors from the North also have a lot of our manufacturing as well. So more jobs went over the Great Lake to CA as well.

Now you know why we're (the US) fucked and if you live in one of the three EU NATO countries or CA, AU, and JP then you are living on my tax dollars.

Now shameful as that may seem, it gets worse. Because the US also subsidizes Asian/Pacific military spending too outside of ANZUS and has defense pacts all over Central and South America and the Caribbean. 

So while the rest of the world sucks off of our tits and has a security blanket over them, Americans are increasingly left behind to fend for themselves. You can't JUST blame the voters. All of these treaties were meant to bring peace and stability to the world and if you live under that umbrella, then you have peace, stability and liberty along with healthcare and education somewhat because of the Americans. To be sure many countries have had to pay for peace in blood, as did the Americans. But the Americans are paying for a lot of your military security so you can prosper (if you live in these countries). Just a thought.",t5_2sjkv,,dee1irp,t3_5wrfc9,

It's really hard to find unbiased stuff that summarizes it because, well.. I think we know why. This understanding of how fences effect migration is just what I've put together from reading many different sources and putting 2 and 2 together myself.

But here is a start for you.

This summarizes how migrants stopped migrating through Hungary after they built a fence.

Hungarian -&gt; English Google translation of that link.

    Gyorgy Bakondi said on Monday twelve weeks on Tuesday, Wednesday 18 am there were four illegal border-crossing borders, even ""peace time"" is particularly low.

    The Senior Advisor to the Prime Minister, is that now, in this way managed to reduce the number of illegal migrants arriving in Hungary, the ""border regime"" - the fence, the guard would manpower and legal criteria - triple protection offered thanks.

    Hungary is the minimum of offensive movement - emphasized the chief of homeland security adviser. At the same time it drew attention to the neighboring countries is still going on mass illegal immigration.

Não foi de todo mal, mas acho que foi melhor para ela do que para mim. Eu tinha 18 anos e a moça estava pra fazer 28. A gente se conhecia por telefone, contato profissional. A coisa começou a esquentar uma vez que ela disse que eu tinha uma voz ""gostosa"" (doida, eu acho a minha voz horrível até hoje) e daí pra frente a gente começou a ter mais intimidade. Um dia a gente marcou de se encontrar depois do expediente, só pra se conhecer pessoalmente, sem segundas intenções até porque tava junto com outro amigo meu, que também foi junto. Chegamos no local, ela já tava lá, me apresentei e conversamos normalmente. Pegamos o ônibus juntos e fomos conversando até a minha parada. Beleza. Ela era baixinha, tinha 1,52 m e era cheinha (gosto), mas até aí eu não tinha interesse nenhum em algo a mais com ela.

Alguns dias depois ela ligou lá pra onde eu trabalhava, como era de costume. No meio do assunto ela solta que havia sonhado comigo e que o sonho tinha teor sexual. Eu achei graça e, na mais pura inocência soltei ""legal, vai que um dia vira verdade, né?"". Mordi a isca, aí ela perguntou ""quando?"". Lembro que na hora eu gelei, sinceramente achei que ela só ia rir ou falar alguma gracinha. Meio que gaguejando eu falei ""não sei, algum dia que você esteja livre"", aí ela pediu pra eu passar na casa dela no próximo sábado, que ela ia fritar uns pastéis e a gente podia ""namorar"" depois.

Uau... depois de desligar o telefone eu fiquei sem saber o que fazer, eu sempre fui tímido, do tipo de ter dificuldade de chegar numa mulher, e agora tava convocado a ir comer uma. Tá, né? Passei a semana ansioso, pois passava muita coisa na cabeça, se eu ia gozar rápido, se eu ia broxar, se ela ia achar meu benes pequeno e por aí vai. Decidi que, naquela semana, ia tocar uma na quinta e na sexta não, para tentar achar um equilíbrio pra não gozar muito cedo e nem broxar (sei lá de onde tirei isso, mas enfim).

Chegou o grande dia, fui até lá e ela tava me esperando com os pastéis. Estavam ótimos (ela cozinhava muito bem), comemos e depois fomos pro quarto dela. Ela ligou a TV, se deitou na cama e pediu pra eu deitar com ela. Me deitei do lado dela e, aos poucos, a coisa foi rolando. Comecei abraçando ela, que evoluiu pra umas carícias, que evoluiu pra beijo na boca, pra mão naquilo e aquilo na mão, boca naquilo e aquilo na boca, enfim, acabou em sexo, obviamente.

O sexo também foi ""engraçado"", pois aconteceu algo que eu não tinha imaginado. Eu simplesmente não conseguia gozar. Metia, metia e nada. E o malaquias também não amolecia, eu tava feito um galo, mas sem conseguir chegar no fim, o que não é muito bom. A gente deve ter feito quase todas as posições básicas imagináveis e não consegui gozar. Ficamos na cama umas três horas, não fazendo sexo direto, teve intervalos e tal, mas infelizmente não consegui.

So, I will try to give you a bit better advice, but the truth of it is, you understand the situation better than most people living in the US.

First, someone called you out for not paying taxes on tips. According to Greek tax law (Αρ.Πρωτ.: Σ. 605/98 ΠΟΛ. 44) tips in this case are not taxed nor considered part of taxable income. Mind you tipping is not the norm in Greece and typically only well-meaning but confused tourists tip. This is especially common in the tourism-related field especially where americans are involved. Point is - please don't go after him nor greek tax code for not accounting for a practice espoused by a foreign culture; tipping does not play the same roll in your average waiter's income as it does in the US.

2nd - Going back to university is not so simple in Greece. There are entrance exams. Did you take them when you were in high school? Did you meet the bases? It sounds like you are looking at private universities. You know very well that these are not highly regarded and that the paper you pay dearly for will be mostly useless in Greece. You also know the education is a joke and will not advance you. Your friends are right, if you choose to stay in greece that is, with the advice to conitnue in the field you are in with getting more advanced certifications. You know how hard it is to find work and how difficult it will be to find a position in another field. Does your family have any connections that you will be able to count on?

For my American friends, in europe and greece especially they love their accreditation. In greece you will see basic computer use certification-giving programs advertised everywhere... Also, you don't just get in to school, you have to pass national exams to hit a base that determines what you can do. Think SAT/ACT being the only factor that mattered to get in to a school. Private schools are kinda diploma mills for the most part and very poorly regarded. Almost exactly like getting a degree from Phoenix University but worse.

3rd - The situation in greece is what it is. It is not going to get better and wages will probably normalize toward the average in the reason. If you are up for it and have the cash reserves, sure make the leap. But know that there is a big difference in using a language in a business/office setting compared to the tourist industry. If you do go abroad, then would be the time to maybe look at a degree while working to advance. Someone mentioned the cyrpus/russia connection which should be of benefit. But let's be frank. There is no shortage of pontos greeks that probably speak better Russian then you.

4th - let's be straight here. You work that hard during the busy tourist season. You do not work that hard year-round. The hours you mentioned are a fact of life in the tourism industry in Greece and many Greeks work those hours till they die. 29 is nothing. I know that is not what you want to hear and that having a life outside of work is important, but common buddy, of course you work hard during the busy part and please, let's skip the pitty party of can't go out with friends. Of course you can't during busy time but I am sure you get plenty of time at other times. To my 3rd point - if you do move abroad know that hard work, long hours, and little free time are the norm. Are you ready to accept that. Most greeks I meet abroad complain about how there is no work life balance and miss home... Don't waste money trying to move abroad if you can't sacrifice that.

5th - Don't do what you freaking love. People are starving in Greece. Kids are on the streets. Put you head down and work. During the depression in the U.S. people did not do what they loved, they did what put food on the table. You should do the same. In the US you can do what you love and easily get some job if you are willing to work if things don't work out. Not so in Greece.

The best advice I can give you is to listen to your friends/family in Greece. They understand the situation, both national and local better than anyone online in another country. 
The second best advice I can give you is to really look hard at yourself. If you are willing to give up on your hanging out with friends  time, get out. Get a job and go to school part time in another country, trade school like someone said sounds good (many smaller towns in germany have a need for manual labor and offer apprentiships for example). From the couple hundred words you typed I don't think this is right for you though and if you look at yourself and say nope - can't do then put your head down, keep working, and try to advance through the certifications within the field. Be thankful you have a job.

Fair point. However, any international experience is still worth something, especially for teams like UOL who might not even make it to Worlds.

Also true, which is why SKT, EDG, C9 etc didn't feel that it was worth their time to attend. The EU teams and FW clearly did, and I think the experience was helpful for them even though it wasn't exactly the highest level of competition.

The thing about leadership is that sometimes you actually need to step up and convince people your ideas are the right ones and not just follow the opinion polls.  Corbyn clearly held his nose to campaign for Remain and it's very clear now he has no objections at all to leaving the EU entirely in the hardest way possible.

If Labour had a leader who was really pro-remain or at least not pro-hard Brexit and was actually taking the government to task for gunning down a path that very few people would have ever considered possible pre-vote (and it would be extremely easy to do so given the amount of promises... sorry ""possibilities"" that have been broken) then maybe it would be the Tories worried about the 39% of their voters who voted Remain going to Labour rather than the other way around.

Split decisions show that. A 4-3 decision in itself shows that it's not ""solid"" legal ground. You change one judge and you change the results. Now stop being obtuse and keep asking me to prove what I already have. The Chaouilli case is textbook example of that. Like just read the dissenting opinions and tell me it's not at least partially motivated. I mean, come the fuck on, read this: ""whether the province of Quebec not only has the constitutional authority to establish a comprehensive single-tier health plan, but to discourage a second (private) tier health sector by prohibiting the purchase and sale of private health insurance""

There is no political motivation there?? This judge rightfully said that the SC shouldn't rule on that but the other judges disagreed. The dissenting judges rightfully admit that it shouldn't be up to them because it's mostly healthcare policy. It's funny because I agree with the ruling since I want private healthcare in this country but I agree with the logic of the dissenting opinion.

So they can't even agree on what is political and what isn't, but somehow I need to prove that to you.


&gt;I'm quoting the important bits

According to whom? You? The great master of all knowledge? It was a bad move done in bad faith and that's all. Let's move on.

&gt;Once again, I'd love to see you present an argument as to why this is the case

I'm not even sure what you want here. I'm literally stating my opinion of what a SC should be able to do. I never said the SC didn't have the right to do that in Canada, I'm saying that I wish the SC couldn't do anything about this. Like when in France a gay couple went to the SC and asked for same sex marriage, the SC just told them it wasn't up to them but the Parliament.

I mean, for fuck's sake, do you even read what I typed? That's a rhetorical question because the answer is obviously no, otherwise you wouldn't be asking this question. Of course it's irrelevant if I think the SC shouldn't rule on that. I never said otherwise. I have only said that I don't like the fact the SC can rule on such things. Is it really that hard to understand?

&gt;Words have meanings. The way you use the term ""activist"" in this context is just not consistent with its actual definition

I fail to see how this is different from the widely accepted meaning of the word (http://www.macleans.ca/politics/what-were-talking-about-when-we-talk-about-judicial-activism/). As in the meaning used by normal people, not stick-in-the-butt lawyers. So I'll gladly give you that I'm probably using the wrong term. I don't care because outside of some really annoying lawyers, everybody would agree and understand.

&gt;I'd disagree

Literally every time I have used the term ""obtuse"" my comment has been removed. But I'm very well aware that my political opinions here have upset enough mods that I get a different treatment. The very fact that your comment is still standing when all my comments with ""obtuse"" have been removed shows that. But that's another story and the fact the moderation is shit and done mostly by stupid mods isn't relevant to our ""discussion"".

&gt;I like it when my rights are protected from an overstepping legislature

And I like when my rights and the interpretation of them isn't up to 9 or 7 non elected judges hand picked by the PM. I like it when my rights come from the Parliament or the people. Again, it seems to be working just fine in Europe and in particular in my home country of Switzerland. I understand the pros of the North American system (and, quite frankly, in the case of same sex marriages, it was definitely better than in Europe where it took a lot longer), but I deeply dislike the cons and the principles. I hate the fact so many big decisions are ultimately in the hands of a couple of judges. And as opposed to many, I dislike it even when the decisions go in the direction I like (which is honestly most of the time in Canada outside of some key decisions such as the kirpan).

&gt;I came into this discussion with an open mind

You obviously didn't and your last comment is just the last evidence of that. But we're not gonna agree on that obviously. But with condescending remarks like this ""The issue isn't with my ability to change, it's with your ability to inspire change"", you really aren't making a great point.

Yes, in the Council of the European Union which makes the laws and regulations for the European Union together with the European Parliament.

&gt; The government that each country elects can actually govern that country without the interference of foreign politicians into their internal affairs.

You are talking about the Greece and the financial crisis, right? That is something that was tackled in the European Council, where countries like Greece are indeed in a weak position, but not just against Germany but basically the entire EU and all creditors. The existence of the European Council is a problem because it throws the European Union back on the level of national states that are haggling for multilateral agreements. The solution to many problems would be to transfer necessary legislative competences in matters of European interest to the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. That would also give countries like Greece and especially the voters a mechanism to change things for themselves. The eurosceptics want the opposite though and transfer more powers to the European Council.

t3_5wr3ly,2,,0,d9_m_5,0,1488412459,False,HistoryWhatIf,False,,1491129209,"I was inspired by penguin_starborn's post to see what the most optimistic scenario is for this. A few assumptions first:

1. I assume by ""discovered"" you mean having sustained contact between Europe and the Americas. This means the events at Vinland remain, but those were insignificant IRL anyway.

2. I'm going to assume a roughly exponential model for technological progress, and a more linear one for trade route density.

3. I'm going to define a ""state"" as a unified government defined by politics, with a codified (though not necessarily written) set of laws. Prestate societies are those where power is generally held by people who are good negotiators or have the charisma to hold power. In these places, there isn't much different between the chief and those below them. 

Let's assume the Americas are left alone for a thousand years starting in around 1500. Let's say that the Catholic Church takes a fundamentalist stance that the Earth is flat, and that Iberia is united under a personal union, so there's no incentive to find new routes to India. 

In 1500, you have two major states, and a few minor city-states along with many prestate societies like chiefdoms and tribal confederacies.

In North America, you have the Aztec Triple Alliance, as well as competitors like Tlaxcala and the Tarascan Empire. These are the only states there in 1500. Societies to watch are the Mississippian chiefdoms, the Pueblo peoples, the Iroquois, and the Calusa, in Florida.

In South America, you have one real state, the Inca Empire, as well as some farming chiefdoms in the Amazon.

Let's say that a people along the Caribbean invent a canoe with a longer range, and a fairly dense trade network forms. The societies trading with each other increases each of their wealth enough to incentivize social striation, so it is likely you'd see states form from the all the societies I've already mentioned. There would be more centralization among the Calusa and the Mississippians, while the confederacies would likely become some sort of republics. 

Let's also say that there happens sustained Polynesian contact with South America. There is evidence (mainly consisting of sweet potatoes) that they had some very minor contact on the scale of Vinland. Over this trade, the Inca and similar societies would most importantly gain pigs and chickens. Having actual farm animals would help increase their growth, and the pigs especially would probably cause some sort of plague. Although you'd see a lot of death, this is actually a *good* thing long-term as it will help counter the European plague.

Over time, you wouldn't see that much technological progress. The Inca or the Mississippians (or both) might enter a bronze age, as they already had some metalworking, but I doubt the people in Mesoamerica would adopt bronze weapons, since obsidian ones are actually better. 

Overall, you'd see an increase in population, and it's likely there would be some advances, but a thousand year's not a long time to go from basic metalworking to even ironworking, let alone steel. This is not to mention that there are no horses or other useful draft animals available, so in direct combat with Europeans the natives would still likely be defeated. However, the plagues which developed in America in this scenario would likely kill many Europeans, so despite their losses the natives would be able to defend themselves a bit. 

In this timeline, it is likely that after contact, the Europeans would probably establish colonies along the coast, and perhaps in the Caribbean, but native civilizations in the Americas wouldn't be completely destroyed as they were in our timeline. ",t5_35koa,,dee3je3,t3_5wr3ly,

The thing that gets me is that this isn't a bargaining chip type situation. Even if that's the terms the government see it in (and clearly they do), at any rate 'hostage exchange' would probably more accurately describe their thinking. 

This is about single market exit, in order to exempt us from free movement. Once we do that, it has absolutely nothing to do with the EU. We will be like any other country outside that system, trade deal or no. It will be entirely up individual EU countries to deal with our citizens in what ever way they see fit, as they do with American or Canadian citizens etc, as we do with American or Canadian citizens (threatening letters and texts and all as my friends have experienced) or indeed will with individual citizens from individual EU countries.

 **comment content**: (cont) 
In Sept of 1935, the Nuremberg Laws were instituted. These laws officially made Jews second-class citizens, and revoked most of their political rights. They were prohibited from marrying or having sexual relations with persons of ""German or related blood"". Racial infamy, as this became known, was made a criminal offense. Roman catholics and protestants who had converted were included in these. These laws prevented Jews from holding public office, from voting, from holding any political positions. It also made it nearly impossible for Jewish people to make a living. 

In 1938, on November 9th, was Kristallnacht. This was a nationwide pogrom, allegedly in response to the murder of German diplomat, Ernst vom Rath by a young Jew in Paris. German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels delievered a fiery speech to the Nazi party faithful in Munich; these party members had gathered to commemorate the anniversary of the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch (Hitler's first attempt to seize power). The speech is a signal for an organized assault on Jewish homes, businesses, and places of worship by the SS, the SA, and other Nazi party organizations, like Hitler Youth. Although the propaganda machine later portrayed this as a spontaneous act of public outrage, the event was well organized. The violence against Jews lasted into the morning of November 10th and became known as Kristallnacht: Night of the Broken Glass. At least 91 Jews were murdered outright, and 30,000 more were arrested and confined in concentration camps. Anyanization, the transfer of Jewish businesses to Aryans, accelerated.

Over the next several years, millions are interred into concentration camps, millions are put to death. The Nazis established ghettos in occupied Poland and Polish and western European Jews were deported to these ghettos. During the German invasion into the Soviet Union in 2941, mobile killing squads were killing entire Jewish communities. After deciding that these killing squads were a burden on the killers, the Nazis began the systematic deportation of Jews, as well as other groups deemed ""undesirable"" under Hitler's ""Final Solution"", from all over Europe to six main extermination camps established in the former Polish territory-- Chelmno, Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and Majdanek. These extermination camps were killing centers designed to carry out genocide. Hitler ordered a ""Night and Fog"" policy underwhich anyone resiting German rule and the Nazi party could be arrested and deported to a concentration camp. Some 7,000 from France alone are arrested under this decree. Prisoners in concentration camps were subject to ""Extermination through Work"". Jews, Roma, Ukrainians, Poles and Czechs as well as some Germans were subject to this, which sentenced prisoners to be worked to death. 

For many years, this went fairly well unchecked. The Great Depression had nations preoccupied with their own problems and lent to an air of mind your own business, as well as contributing to the attitude of xenophobia that prevented many trying to escape Hitler's rule from  immigrating. But long before the allied nations stepped in, others were quietly risking their lives to help and protect those who would be targeted by Hitler's regime. Pastor Andre Trocme, Roger Darcissac, and Edourd Theis aided in transporting refugees across the border into neutral Switzerland, as well as hiding them in private homes, schools, and local monastaries. German industrialist, Oskar Schindler moved Jewish workers from Plaszow concentration camp to a factory in Bruennlitz. He saved 1,000 Jews by claiming they were essential to war time production. They remained under his care until liberation in 1945. 

There's obviously much more to this. Like I said, this is just a basic representation of the timeline.

Between NP and Wings I'll give the later the edge, because Wings competed in more tournament with more top tier teams, while NP has mostly been playing NA quals and their opponents generally aren't as good as what Wings have faced. I don't list any other chinese teams because none of them apart from the other potential invitees performed well recently. All in all the only decisions is to either invite Wings (and round up the invites to 8 teams), or omitting Wings, but with extra 1 qual spots I don't think China will get 3, and EU I think deserves it more than NA so it'll be something like : 2CN 2SEA 2EU 1CIS 1NA 1SA.",t5_2s580,visage,dee5hil,t3_5wxx0m,

It's not hard to make an anecdote along the lines of two people who have fallen out but each possess an item valuable to the other. Both are keen, and really need their item back. Does it make more sense for person A just to give Person B their item back in goodwill and because it's only right they get their possession back.

You can say we're talking about people instead of items, but which approach had the best chance of getting the right outcome for both parties? That is what we want after all, the rights of EU citizens and UK citizens to maintain their right to live where they are currently living.

No one is arguing that there weren't horrible things that happened then, as there are horrible things that happen today. But as you yourself point out they weren't the same horrors. The concept of 'minority' or 'discrimination' have specific meanings -- they refer to systematic mechanisms of economic oppression and denial of humanity articulated through the centralized power of the modern nation-state. These are not the same mechanisms that were at work in the past, and thus we need a different vocabulary to talk about them. 

Can we use the terms 'minority' and 'discrimination' to talk about the Jews of Basra in the 16th-18th century who maintained critical trade routes in the Persian Gulf and with India, and thus constituted not only one of the most powerful actors in the diwan of the city but in the Ottoman empire as a whole : able to exert influence on the Sultan's policies given the importance of their economic power? The specific situation of any given Jew in Basra of the period is incomparable to that of a Jew in another city or province : there were localized negotiations of power between religions, sects, guilds ( tawa2if^1 ) and janissaires within each city in the empire as well as the set of relations that that city maintained with Istanbul. This is completely different from the modern context where power is centralized and universalized in the hands of the State. The concepts of 'minority' and 'discrimination' occlude more than they reveal in such a context.

Oh yeah we definitely had quotes for all those stinkin german immigrants and those stinkin irish immigrants and those stinkin catholics and those stinkin eastern europeans and their stinking communism. The thing is, we as a nation have grown past the irrational fears we had of other people. Now most people can trace their heritage back to some of those same immigrant groups that were unjustly persecuted when they got here and america would be wildly different if any one of those mass groups of immigrants never stepped on Elis Island. Though to be fair, you are right, we had rather strict quotas for non-whites (especially the japanese and chinese).

&gt;Look around, its very clear that our infrastructure can't support it, and not just our infrastructure but the entire world is massively overpopulated.

That's untrue, the western world is rapidly losing population and countries with strict immigration laws like the japanese are experiencing a [population crisis](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/02/japans-population-is-shrinking-what-does-it-mean-for-the-economy/)  . Even [russia is affected](http://www.businessinsider.com/a-perfect-demographic-storm-is-crippling-russia-2015-9)

Our infrastructure can more than support a million new immigrants. America is doing so well and not experiencing similar problems *because* immigration is able to lessen the effects of our lowering birth rate (though not enough to prevent population decline). Our economy is in a great place with only [4.9% unemployment](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate) and it would bode well for us to introduce more cultures. I'm a firm believer in america ""the melting pot"" and, as history has shown us, we will continue to take the best aspects of different cultures and mix them together into something wonderful.


&gt;just because you are anti something does not mean you should be labeled a hate group.

The site most likely had much better reasons than you give it credit for, and quick research on any of the groups would more than likely show you why they are classified as such, like how I explained why the CAIR is obviously a hate group.


&gt;The whole idea notion that the country population is declining and must be replenished by immigrants is a stupid meme supported by business who need a never ending supply of cogs in their machines to make the product to sell to a never ending supply of mindless consumers as a race to use more and more finite resources before the competitor.

Source? If anything is a meme its the ""overpopulation"" argument that was left over from 2010 when the world population was on the crux of (but not there yet) stabilizing.

Earlier in the thread, you asked me what has changed in these 7 countries, I feel like the question is relevant again, so what's different now?  

I'm all for reviewing and improving the vetting process, even for making it stricter, but I don't see why all of the sudden these countries are more dangerous than they were 2 months ago.   I'd want to see evidence of an immediate threat, before I'd support a drastic cut off be implemented.

(as a side note, I don't see what makes these 7 more dangerous than some others, and I don't care if it's Obama's list.  Obama can be and was wrong too).  

Also, I'd argue that the past is relevant, because the people that are close to today being let into ~~are~~ our country, are people who applied over a year ago.  This process is so slow as it is, I don't see why new features can't be put into place gradually.

You guys overseas find some of their lines in the drugstore such as Göt2Be (which is spelled Got2Be here ... the alternate spelling with that cliche ""Umlaut"" makes it look more european to english speaking customers I suppose).

 The following lines are my favourites:

1. Schauma shampoos and leave-in conditioner. Loving the 7-Kräuter (smell reminds me of a summer fling back in 1999) and Repair &amp; Care (with Shea Butter, my yummy ""nutty"" scalp gets compliments because of it)) lines // € 1,55-2,00 per item

3. Gliss Kur and their Total Repair line // € 0,95 - 3,00 per item I think

An equally big shout out goes to the  [Swiss O. Par haircare](http://www.rufin.de/ice/?domain=www.rufin.de&amp;lang=2&amp;fuseaction=extarticle&amp;menu=1886) line by the brand Rufin.

I am frequently using a.k.a buying in bulk:


1. Frottee Dry Shampoo in the blue bottle. The only dry shampoo in German drugstores for decades before it became a trend like 4-7 years ago. I never want to use another brand. // € 1,79
2. Coconut Hair Wax // € 2,00 I think
3. Pferdemark rinse-out Hairpack. Weird yet familiar smell (it's a classic) but happy hair afterwards. I don't even know what's actually in there.  // € 0,65 per sachet. 2-4 uses per sachet on short hair, 1-2 on longer hair.

**Why buy a GFE with me?** 

I’m a young and open minded chubby European brunette. I love animals and music and have a soft spot for animal lovers. I’m a great listener and a very good emotional support. I hate seeing people experience bad things and always do my best to cheer them up and make them smile. Can I make you smile? :)

I’m a sucker for all things homemade such as homemade food. I am a big food lover and have a passion for cooking for others. 

As for my sexual side, I am open to almost everything. Pee and pee play is definitely one of my favorites! I love anal, DP, I’m usually submissive and rarely dominant. I also enjoy nipple pain and self tit bondage. And for those of you who have a foot fetish, I have very sexy feet as well ;)

That's a contract, not a voluntary agreement. Prostitution isn't legal in most places in the U.S., but it's still an agreement between two parties. 

&gt;Speculation

It has never been demonstrated that all native workers without a high school diploma are negatively affected by low-skilled immigration. If you want to provide evidence that it does, feel free to do so. 

&gt;I don't recall English being a requirement to work on farms, construction, gardening, being a nanny, and a variety of other jobs.
&gt;
You're vastly overestimating the ability to speak English. It's a good skill. It's hardly required for many low-skilled jobs. Which is precisely why immigrants have had success with them in the last 150 years.

It's also required for other low-skilled jobs that low-skilled immigrants from Mexico simply cannot compete with. That's partly why the evidence has shown immigration complements the labor market. 

&gt;Their needs so surpass the rest. We're talking about people in permanent poverty vs. getting some products slightly cheaper. It's not a ""small"" percentage of the population. It's 11.1 million people! That's the entire state of Ohio. 

I'm referring to the number of people who are negatively affected by low-skilled immigration, which is certainly lower than 11 million people and far lower than the total number of people who benefit from immigration. 

&gt;Some? Almost everyone gets hit in some way. Do you think all the people that lost their jobs in Flint, MI just had to deal with it? Taxpayers pick up the tab. Families pick up the tab. Retail does worse. Services decrease. Whole towns are obliterated. Priceless things are destroyed. You are talking like a blind globalist. Which is exactly the problem. You look at things you can't quantify and you say ""that has no value"". You're completely wrong. 

And here you are continuing to let your emotions speak for you instead of facts. For one thing, the vast majority of manufacturing jobs was lost due to automation, not free trade. Well before NAFTA was even implemented the trend of manufacturing jobs was down while productivity has been consistently increasing. It's so much easier to paint a picture of doom and gloom when you don't let those pesky things called facts get in the way I suppose. 

&gt;An simple economic theory is not sufficient to explain the macroeconomics of trade in the United States. Just like the economic policy should be completely and exclusively based on ""Keynesian economics"" or ""the Austrian school"". You basing your entire theory on a mechanism that reality has proven to show little truth in. If it had truth we wouldn't have elected Donald Trump. The rust belt would be fine and we'd have half the low wage workers.

This entire paragraph is quite simply nonsense, as in it's not even constructed in an articulate way. I can only ask: what the *fuck* are you even talking about?

&gt;Because our growth rates were exception. Globalization was almost non-existent. Automation was non-existent. This was a reality. Countries like China and India were unrecognizable. They has little to no industry, let alone a middle class or technology. It's a fallacy to assume the past economic models have any relevance today. They don't.

Totally wrong. Automation was a large reason why manufacturing was booming in multiple countries in the first place, and globalization allowed for more trade between countries as well as for the rebuilding of Europe. Multiple countries experienced economic booms post WW2, not just the U.S. 

But that's besides the point. Women entering the workplace didn't lead to mass negative economic effects much like how low-skilled immigrants haven't either. 

&gt;I guess we'll just throw out farming, processing plants, construction, home services, childcare and a whole host of other things then.

Again, this is your prax. Where is your *evidence* that native workers are 1. wanting these jobs and 2. losing them to low-skilled immigrants at a high rate?

&gt;Are you actually saying Mexicans bring gardening skills?! That's the most racist shit I've heard all day.

Let's not put words into my mouth now. Immigration coming into the U.S. is typically either low-skilled or high-skilled, but a lot of native workers in the labor market are somewhere in between. That's why immigration tends to complement the labor market. If the labor market was homogeneous, you'd see much more negative effects.  

&gt;You keep saying this, yet there is no empircal evidence. Just your prax.

http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/natives.pdf

&gt;Oh my god. It's as if businesses that can't function and innovate are going to fail because they actually have to pay people a living wage. What a concept. 

Yeah it's almost like restricting things that are shown to cause economic growth is a stupid idea. 

&gt;Then why does the entire developed world restrict immigration far more then the United States?

Whatever their reasons, it isn't based in economics. Xenophobia is certainly a main driver.

&gt;I'm not advocating for less or more. I'm advocating for legal. You're the one advocating for illegal immigration. You're the one advocating for open borders.

If the borders were ""open,"" then by definition any immigration wouldn't be illegal. Try and be consistent, mate. 

&gt;wow. Once again trying to dismiss the negative consequences on the poor. You're lack of critical thinking is astounding.

I'm not dismissing them. I specifically said before that compensation is a worthwhile policy of looking into. I just think it's a stupid idea to reduce something that benefits the country as a whole because a small segment of the country may be negatively affected. 

&gt;The link says the evidence for the poor is not good. That's all I'm saying. 

Except the actual economic literature is mixed on the effects of low-skilled natives. Your link, however, agrees with me in saying immigration is a net good. 

&gt;Let's see what happens when we import 3 million more young men with no educations into a country struggling with CPI, wage growth, unemployment and buckling social services.

What the hell are you talking about? Unemployment is below 5 percent, wages have increased in the last few months, and compensation has been steadily increasing. Again, painting more doom and gloom despite the facts not agreeing with you. 

&gt;But I'm not going to continue arguing with an open-borders, Clintonian globalist who thinks a couple of papers are great. Papers who missed pretty much most of the costs associated with flooding illegal immigration. 

Because your arguments are weak and simply are not supported by reality. You can keep handwaving empirical evidence all you want; it doesn't make your argument look any stronger.

Germany is no leader. This is from my first hand experience, as... you might guess why. I can't remember if I wrote about it too. In any case Germany is struggling politically as a country right now although they are far less polarized as a political society so they do not show it the same way Americans do and they struggle with their leadership within the EU and it's a far more important issue for them.    For everything else they rely too much on America and they only seem nice because they allowed America to take all the ugly burdens of leadership.

Damaging info:

&gt; American allies, including the British and the Dutch, had provided information describing meetings in European cities between Russian officials — and others close to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin — and associates of President-elect Trump, according to three former American officials who requested anonymity in discussing classified intelligence. Separately, American intelligence agencies had intercepted communications of Russian officials, some of them within the Kremlin, discussing contacts with Trump associates.

&gt;The warning signs had been building throughout the summer, but were far from clear. As WikiLeaks was pushing out emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee through online publication, **American intelligence began picking up conversations in which Russian officials were discussing contacts with Trump associates, and European allies were starting to pass along information about people close to Mr. Trump meeting with Russians in the Netherlands, Britain and other countries.**

This will lead to a homogenized global culture that will reflect their mode of communication.

So what is more important, the language or the culture? You said that language is a core, but there are multi-lingual cultural groups (nations). Given the rest of your post, it sounds like the culture is central, given that you take language as a contributing factor as opposed to the site of cultural genocide. So here is a problem:

Any interaction with other cultures tends to change them, and this is even more true of smaller and more isolated cultural groups. There are global film, music, and cultural industries. Each changes cultures in serious ways. A translated Hollywood movie (as part of a global popular culture) doesn't change language, but it does Westernize in much more tangible ways (promoting a way of life, consumerism, social order, etc.) Is that cultural genocide? On your standard, it seems you must say yes. To me, that stretches credulity far beyond the breaking point. It's cultural change... not genocide.

Genocide is a serious issue, and *preventing people* from having a language is a serious crime with a terrible history. Legislating groups out of existence in other ways is also a serious crime (I'm thinking of the Kurds treatment by... basically everyone here). But genocide is most often intentional, as with the Armenians, European Jews, and Hutus. What you are proposing makes little distinction between intentions. Unintentional genocide is an odd idea - but you standard makes it a common feature of the world.",t5_2w2s8,,deebxy6,t3_5x0k85,

I'm skeptical of arguments that it goes too far in some kind of categorical way. There are of course hardcore Libertarian, Anarchist, etc. positions which reject all income taxes, state education, public roads, etc. Under those philosophies, single-payer is sort of just obviously illegitimate, and there isn't much analysis to be done there.

Under other positions that accept some kind of publicly beneficial state expenditures, single-payer healthcare seems as a general matter of principle, acceptable. After all, when you say 'mandating healthcare', you are not talking about forcing people to accept injections or forcing inspection by doctors. You are also presumably not forbidding them from seeking some private care provider paid for by private funds. You are talking about taxing people (say 10%) such that they have something available to them if they choose to partake of it.

But beyond the general principles, there are a lot of interesting details:

* How much benefit does healthcare really provide for society under a given scheme?
* Is the redistributive scheme created by a specific healthcare program appropriate from a social welfare and/or rights perspective?

In some versions of single-payer, we would essentially be transferring money from the young, healthy for old, sick, and relatively well-off patients to get mostly useless medical care from wealthy, greatly enriched hospital owners and doctors. In other versions, we transfer money from the somewhat poor to the somewhat better off but mostly pay for genuinely helpful medical care and pay doctors adequately but not richly. Evidence from Europe shows that it's not incredibly difficult to be closer to the latter than the former, but it does require careful and politically fraught management.

To return to your question:

&gt; then why not simply adopt the single payer system?

A standard and appropriate response is that the transition would be anything but simple. The current U.S. system involves large private companies—insurance companies—doing the complex administrative work of adjudication, care management, reimbursement, etc. The federal or state governments building or 'nationalizing' this capacity are both incredibly complex and risky undertakings.",t5_2qn9g,,deed70b,t3_5wz21v,

That's because you are assuming that the ""history"" we read is true. Most of what we know is nonsense propaganda. The american revolution had nothing to do with ""freedom"", ""taxation without representation"", equality or any other bullshit we are brainwashed with. The american revolution was completely about wealth and land ( more precisely the colonists' desire to steal native's land and the british desire to protect their fur trade in the great lakes region.

The biggest cash cow for the european empires in the 1700s was the fur trade, whose importance then is like the importance of oil in the 1900s. After the british won the Seven Year's War with the help of the native americans, they wanted to secure the lucrative fur trade they got from the french ( who ceded the entirety of ""canada"" to the british ). The great lakes region was the center of fur trade ( in terms of wealth think of what oil is today ) but the british had a very tenuous control over the great lakes region. The dominant power in the americas in the mid 1700s were not the british/french/etc. It was the native tribes. To protect their fur trade and to appease the native tribes, the british made the appalachians the border of the american colonies in 1763.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Proclamation_of_1763

But the american colonists wanted to get more land and to expand westward because to us, land/farm was the wealth we desired. But of course, if you are the king, the interest of the royal treasury ( filled mostly with fur trade ) was far more important than the interests of your far flung subjects. And this is where the conflict of interests led to an actual physical conflict. 


It's like today how our leaders view our oil interests in the middle east as being far more important than clean drinking water of the ""peasants"" in flint, michigan. The american revolution was just a result of the british fur trade interest butting heads with colonists desire to expand and to get more land. 


Of course all revolutions love to coat/mask their greed with nonsense about noble ideals... But at the end of the day, the british loved the money that the fur trade gave them and we loved stealing native people's land. That's all it was. ",t5_2qh53,,deee1a7,t3_5wyygm,

Maybe you believe it's only 30 seconds more, but those of us with our ""poor retorts"" believe it to be much longer than that. It's not like someone queues up as Nova, waits 30 seconds in queue without a match, then switches to Brightwing because it'll be a faster queue. The popular heroes will still be selected the most, and new rules will just prevent them from being matched up. That means fewer matches for everyone. We know for a fact that QM tries to avoid mirror matches, yet people are saying it happens all the time. As queue times increase, the restrictions become looser and that's when mirrors happen. If you think more rules will mean more balanced games without sacrificing queue time then I just don't agree.

You are matched based on your MMR or match making rankings not your SR/level.

MMR is a combination of personal skill + win/loss + win loss streaks.

Season 2 gave everybody a inflated SR rank. People got placed way higher than they were suppose to be. Season 3 ended 1 week after season 2. Unless your hand fell off or you magically got good. you generally stayed about the same skill level as when you ended (NOT PLACED) in the previous season. Season 3 started everybody a bit lower and based on MMR and win/loss you got placed in season 3. If you were constantly playing till the end of season 2. you would have generally been placed near your season 2 ending SR. If you just did 10 placements and never touched comp again in S2. Don't be surprised when your season 3 SR placement was dramatically lower not only because system started people lower to adjust the season 2 inflated SR but because you were never as good as you thought you were to begin with.

SR tier =/= skill for that tier. You are matched based on your MMR. Diamond players can have the SR of a diamond player but the MMR of like a plat player. Your MMR or match making rankings is a hidden value based on a combination of personal performance/skill and win/loss. MMR is then used to calculate who you get queued up with and how much SR is gain/loss at the end of a game. With both wins/loss and skill in mind. Your skill is not determined by win/loss. So theoretically a person who is a diamond skilled player will still be playing at a diamond skill level even if he loses. This means his MMR will be higher than say a bronze whos MMR is lower than his despite having more wins.

The playerbase/time of playing also affects who you get queued up with. Regions with less players means the system would rather you not wait 1 hour for a queue and instead give you the next best thing after 5 minutes. People in Placement matches are only queued based on MMR so you can theoretically be in diamond and still get unranked players. Time of day affects the number of people playing which means a grandmaster player can (very low chance but possible) of being queued up with a silver if he plays at like 5 am in the morning on a tuesday on xbox in EU.

MMR affects how much SR you gain/lose at the end of a match. If your MMR is lower than the MMR for that SR tier should be. you will lose more points. The system is trying to drop you down to a MMR range closer to yours so you will lose more SR per loss. If your MMR is higher than the MMR for that SR tier should be. you will gain more points. The system is trying to push you up to a MMR range closer to yours so you will gain more SR per win. Winning and losing games IN A ROW also affects MMR. It essentially adds like a bonus for every additional game you win/loss in a row allowing your MMR to climb/drop faster.

The SR averages between 2 teams also impacts a small portion of how much SR is gained/loss at the end of a game.

Essentially the determining factors to SR gain/loss are: Your MMR + your win/loss + win/loss streak + SR averages.

The more games you play the more accurate your MMR is. Those with lucky win streaks or unlucky loss streaks will eventually turn around. Unless your one of those that claim you can never win a game cause god is punishing only you. If you are a plat player and you fall too low because of luck. you will eventually hit a point with players worse than you and you will start climbing again. If you are struggling to climb out of a SR that is theoretically suppose to be less skilled than where you placed then maybe your not as skilled as you think. SR is just a tier and reward system.

I have to accept that your first two examples sound ridiculous to me but neither of us have sufficient data about the universe to discredit them.  You and I both have to take on faith that which we believe (and don't believe) about reality.  So what makes any one belief set more likely than another?

From my side of the issue here are the reasons that I believe in Christianity.

The cornerstone of Christian doctrine comes from the four gospels, the reason we have four accounts of the same events is because these are meant as historical documents to verify that the events occurred.  Three are direct eye witness accounts and one (The Gospel According to Luke) is the work of a historian drawn from the testimonies of eye witnesses.  All were recorded within the lifetimes of the eye witnesses.

The long hereditary line leading to Christ that begins the gospel of Matthew is meant to document the familial lineage that Christ was born into and that it in fact traces back to King David.  The reason this is important is that it shows us two things.  These gospels were meant to be taken as fact, not as fictional stories for moral instruction, and it was important that Christ's ancestry was in line with the House of David.

The House of David part of that is very important because the Jews of the time were waiting for their Messiah who was prophesied to be a descendant of their ancient king.  

It is the fulfillment of prophecy which separates Christianity from other belief sets and confirms it as the truth.

Naturally I understand that you would not accept all the prophecies that Christ fulfilled, since some of them were supernatural in nature.  (I think particularly of his own predictions of his death and resurrection as good examples of that.)  I will therefore present a few of the prophecies that neither Jesus nor the Jews could have controlled or brought about but that you might be willing to accept actually happened.

Here are just a few of the prophecies that were fulfilled (there are more than 300 in total)

**He would be born in Bethlehem as described in Matthew 2:1-6:**
 
Micah 5:2
&gt;But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,
    who are too little to be among the clans of Judah,
from you shall come forth for me
    one who is to be ruler in Israel,
whose coming forth is from of old,
    from ancient days.

**He would come out of Egypt:  His family fled to Egypt in Matthew 2:13-15.**

Hosea 11:1
&gt;When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.

**He would establish a new covenant (one place where that is shown happening is Matthew 26:28)**

predicted in Jeremiah 31:31-34
&gt;31 “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, 32 not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the Lord. 33 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

**He would be a substitutional sacrificial atonement for sins, the fullfilment and reality of the passover ritual**

Exodus 12 (the first passover)
and
Genesis 22 (the sparing of Isaac when the Lord provided a ram to be sacrificed in his place)

**The Messiah would be betrayed for thirty pieces of silver which is recorded in Matthew 26:14-15**

Zechariah 11:12-13
&gt;12 Then I said to them, “If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.” And they weighed out as my wages thirty pieces of silver. 13 Then the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord, to the potter. 


Psalm 22 is actually referenced by Christ on the cross when he cries out ""My God! My God! (Eloi!  Eloi!) Why have you forsaken me?"".  In it are several seeming depictions of the crucifixion event which would occur at the hands of the pagan Romans according to their custom many centuries later.  I specify that because the Romans would have no knowledge of nor desire to act out Jewish beliefs in their execution of Jesus.

**The Messiah would would be scorned and despised by the people as is described in Matthew 27 where he is mocked by the guards, the robbers on the crosses next to him and the crowd**

Psalm 22:6-8
&gt;6But I am a worm and not a man,
scorned by mankind and despised by the people.
7All who see me mock me;
they make mouths at me; they wag their heads;
8“He trusts in the Lord; let him deliver him;
let him rescue him, for he delights in him!” 


**They would pierce his hands and feet (a prediction made long before the invention of crucifixion) and his killers would cast lots/gamble for his clothes in John 19:23-24:**

Psalm 22:16-18
&gt;16For dogs encompass me;
a company of evildoers encircles me;
they have pierced my hands and feet—
17I can count all my bones—
they stare and gloat over me;
18they divide my garments among them,
and for my clothing they cast lots.


**The Jews would reject their Messiah as evidenced by the common record of history throughout the last 2000 years:**

 Psalm 118:22 
&gt;The stone that the builders rejected
    has become the cornerstone.


These prophecies tell me that God promised a Savior for mankind and then He delivered on that promise.  These prophecies show me that Jesus is that Savior.  I hope that provides a window into my beliefs for you.  

Christ's miracles and His resurrection are also points of belief.  I believe on the eye witness accounts that those things really happened.  One might say, ""But those things are impossible.""  And I would say that if a man said he had done it, it would be impossible.  However, if there is an all powerful God who has intervened in human history at one point then it would be perfectly reasonable to expect that He could perform deeds that are impossible for men to prove His divine origin.  By using multiple authors who lived across the Middle East and Mediterranean Europe and spoke and wrote in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, God has put together one cohesive story with foreshadowing, out and out prophecy and the fulfillment of that prophecy.  Prophecies that were fulfilled by the enemies of the Jews, completely out of the power of members of their sect.  These sorts of coincidences are consistent with the concept that God did intervene in human history and gave authority to His religion through miracles and unfailing prophecies.

I just thought of another I wanted to mention.  Christ prophesied the destruction of the second Temple of Jerusalem as well which had stood for over 500 years at the time.  In 70 AD, about 30 years after his death and resurrection the Romans did indeed destroy it.",t5_2qh1i,,deeg239,t3_5wzx1q,

 **comment content**: You'll almost certainly need a Rx from a local-ish (Schengen, I think) doctor. Have your US MD fax a copy of your Rx, and book an appointment with a health clinic. Maybe $30-40 to see a GP and get your prescription.

I'm not sure about the UK specifics, but that will generally work everywhere. Insulin is a *lot* cheaper outside of the US, so a vial won't break the bank (something like $55 for a 10ml vial of rapid-acting Humalog/Novolog/Apidra in France)

Novorapid is also called Novolog. It's the same thing, just a different name. Novo Nordisk is Danish, so they're quite present in the European market.

I can suggest a clinic or two in Paris if you can't work it out before then. Good luck!

The cost per soldier is just simply lower in Russia and China, or in the case of Europe or Canada or many other nations the population and size of the nation means they just spend less in total just because of the population differences. 

If china had to pay their soldiers the same amount, pay the same amount for Equipment their military budget would be higher then Americas, but they don't have to pay as much because the costs are different, China is going to see it's military costs skyrocket in the next 20 years as their pay levels rise higher, it's already increased by 200% in the last 15 years for that reason, If and when China ever gets a GDP similar to the US they also will be spending similar amounts on their military. 

If France had the same population as the US along with what the french currently spend as a percentage of GDP they would be at 450 billion a year, that is pretty damn close to what the US spends, Same with Japan and the United kingdom.

&gt; Kraftwerk (""power plant"" in English) is an electronic band founded in 1970 in Düsseldorf, Germany. They pioneered electronic music in the 70s and are considered one of the most important and influential bands of their genre, often described as ""the godfathers of electronic music"". Kraftwerk's sound is minimalistic and strictly electronic; it combines driving, repetitive rhythms with catchy melodies and vocals usually sung through a vocoder. The current line-up consists of Ralf Hütter (the only original member), Fritz Hilpert, Henning Schmitz and Stefan Pfaffe. The other founding member Florian Schneider left the band in 2008.

&gt; Ralf Hütter (born 1946, Krefeld, Germany) and Florian Schneider (born 1947, Düsseldorf, Germany) met while they were studying improvised music in Düsseldorf, Germany. In 1967 Ralf Hütter (organ), Florian Schneider (violin, flute), Basil Hammoudi (vocals), Butch Hauf (bass) and Fred Monics (drums) formed the group Organisation, released the album Tone Float and split shortly thereafter. The album features repetitive percussion and bass drum patterns embellished with guitar, flute, violin and organ. 

&gt; After disbanding Organisation, Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider adopted the name Kraftwerk. Early Kraftwerk line-ups from 1970–1974 fluctuated, as Hütter and Schneider worked with around a half-dozen other musicians, most notably Andreas Hohmann (drums; 1970), Houschäng Néjadepour (guitar; 1970), Charly Weiss (drums; 1970/71), Eberhard Kranemann (cello, bass, hawaii-guitar; 1970/71), Klaus Röder (electric guitar, electronic violin; 1974), Michael Rother (guitar; 1970-71) and Klaus Dinger (drums; 1970-71). For a short period in 1970/71 Ralf Hütter left the band to complete his degree in architecture. There were some sessions/concerts with the line-up ""Schneider, Kranemann, Weiss"",  ""Schneider, Hohmann, Kranemann, Rother, Dinger"" and ""Schneider, Rother, Dinger"" in that time.  In 1971 Rother and Dinger left Kraftwerk to form the band Neu!.

&gt; Their first three albums were more free-form experimental rock without the pop hooks or the more disciplined strong structure of its later work. Their debut album, Kraftwerk, released in 1970, and Kraftwerk 2, released in 1972, were mostly exploratory jam music, played on a variety of traditional instruments including guitar, bass, drums, electric organ, flute and violin. Post-production modifications to these recordings were then used to distort the sound of the instruments, particularly audio-tape manipulation and multiple dubbings of one instrument on the same track. Connie Plank co-produced the first four Kraftwerk albums. Emil Schult has also collaborated on many releases, contributing both lyrics and graphics.

&gt; Live performances from 1972–73 were made as a duo, using a simple beat-box-type electronic drum machine, with preset rhythms taken from an electric organ. These shows were mainly in Germany, with occasional shows in France. In 1973, Wolfgang Flür (electronic percussion) joined the group.

&gt; With Ralf und Florian, released in 1973, the band began to move closer to its classic sound, relying more heavily on synthesisers and drum machines. Although almost entirely instrumental, the album marks Kraftwerk's first use of the vocoder, which would, in time, become one of its musical signatures. 

&gt; In 1974, they issued the fourth studio album, Autobahn. This critically acclaimed album marked Kraftwerk's breakthrough and established them as purveyors of electronic music. The title track is intended to capture the feeling of driving on the Autobahn: from travelling through the landscape, the high-speed concentration on the fast lane, to tuning the car radio and the monotony of a long trip. An edited version of ""Autobahn"" song reached #25 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and #11 in the UK.

&gt; In 1975, Karl Bartos (electronic percussion, live vibraphone, live keyboards) joined the band. The Hütter-Schneider-Bartos-Flür formation is now regarded as the classic line-up of Kraftwerk, which remained in place until the late 80s.

&gt; In 1975, Kraftwerk released the concept album Radio-Activity (German version: Radio-Aktivität). The hyphenated album title displays Kraftwerk's typical deadpan humour, being a pun on the twin themes of the songs, half being about radioactivity and the other half about activity on the radio. The title track ""Radioactivity"" was released as a single, and became a hit in France after it was used as the theme to a popular music show. This was the first Kraftwerk album to be entirely self-produced by Hütter &amp; Schneider in their Kling Klang studio, and the first one to be performed by the classic line-up of Kraftwerk.

&gt; In 1977, Kraftwerk released the highly influential album, Trans-Europe Express. Critics have described the album as having two specific themes: celebration of Europe and the disparities between reality and image. Musically, the songs on this album differ from the group's earlier Krautrock style with a focus on electronic mechanized rhythms, minimalism, and occasional manipulated vocals. Two singles supported the album: ""Trans-Europe Express"" and ""Showroom Dummies"".

&gt; By the time of 1978's The Man-Machine (German version: Die Mensch-Maschine), Kraftwerk had created their own unmistakable brand of ""robot pop"". NME said of The Man-Machine: 'It is the only completely successful visual/aural fusion rock has produced so far"". Kraftwerk spent three years building their own Kling Klang studios in the late 70s, complete with, inevitably, scores of computers. The single ""The Model"", gave the band a surprise hit when it topped the UK charts in 1982.

&gt; In 1981 Kraftwerk released their eight studio album, Computer World (German version: Computerwelt). This album combined the use of the sequencer to create the sound now known as electro, inspiring the first producers in Detroit in creating techno, as well as innumerable other artists including Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, and New Order, among many others. This album had the theme of computers taking over the world in the future. It was a commercial success, spawning the singles ""Pocket Calculator"", ""Computer World"" and ""Computer Love"". For this album, the band embarked on the massive Computer World world tour.

&gt; The EP Tour De France was issued in 1983. This song was featured in the film Breakdance and became the theme for the cycling event of the same name in that year. In 1986, the ninth studio album Electric Café was released. The album received mixed reviews. Two singles were issued from the album: ""Musique Non-Stop"" and ""The Telephone Call"".

&gt; In 1987 Wolfgang Flür departed and it was replaced by Fritz Hilpert. In 1991, Kraftwerk's best known songs were collected together and re-recorded on the compilation The Mix.

&gt; The single Expo 2000 released in December 1999 came as a surprise for Kraftwerk fans. A brand new song, although low key, sparked hopes of a new album. A video was released for this track, showing the band playing in wireframe suits, but no public appearances or interviews until 2003.

&gt; In 2003 the band released Tour de France Soundtracks, its first album of new material since 1986's Electric Café. The album was recorded for the 100th anniversary of the first Tour de France bicycle race, although it missed its original release date during the actual Tour. A completely new recording was made for the ""Tour De France"" track, based on the original 1983 arrangement.

&gt; In June 2005, Kraftwerk released Minimum-Maximum, their first official live album. It features two CDs and tracks recorded on their world tour during 2004, including concerts in Warsaw, Moscow, Berlin, London, Budapest, Tallinn, Riga, Tokyo and San Francisco. The band also released a live DVD.

&gt; Florian Schneider officially left the band in January 2009, though news of his departure was reported as early as April 2008. His place will be taken over by Stefan Pfaffe. 

&gt; In 2009, the band issued The Catalogue (German version: Der Katalog), a box-set comprising eight albums by Kraftwerk that were released from 1974 to 2003. All albums were digitally remastered, with most of the cover art redesigned, including rare photographs in the liner notes that were not part of each album's original release.

&gt; Kraftwerk's influence has been incalculable. Hundreds of artists today in nearly every electronic music subgenres bear witness to their work. They are also reclusive, rarely giving interviews and making no media appearances.

This post-colonial model in which the US informally manages the colonies and is culturally ridiculed and fiscally bled is complete bullshit. Recognizing itself, Russia, and China as frontiers and opening new industries and industrializing and competing in the future (tech, robots, space) isn't a bad thing.

It's bad for Europe because it wants to live in the past and reengineer idealistic European identities and culture during their reconstruction. The whole civilized thing is just post-war propaganda, extreme leftwing blowback from defeating the extreme rightwing in the World Wars (colonial race wars). Fact is, the US stands to gain nothing in inheriting the old world except WWIII, and Europe didn't purge evil by defeating the extreme-right and become enlightened, it just allowed the extreme-left to rebuild European societies without any further duties, blocking Russia from competitive trade relationships and from establishing itself in the post-war era.

American isolationism favors the United States big time because it cannot be geographically isolated. If it can stay united and maintains a powerful military to defend itself navally, being between the major global oceans, it's basically merchant paradise. Europe wants to prevent that, because what does it really have except the northern Atlantic and Mediterranean, a divided subcontinent.

Also, apologies for the lack of sources, I'll endeavour to find some but most of this information comes from compressed notes and readings provided for my institution and prof, which I am unaware has an exact text or online form which I can link or cite here. Nevertheless I believe they are accurate, but due to this I shall refrain from giving specific figures out of fear of inaccuracies.

To expand a bit on your question prior to answering it. America primarily ""intervened"" in Western Europe and the Far East to aid in the reconstruction. I assume what you mean by intervention is the provision of economic aid and some an extent an American Presence in the country. And I would assume that this falls under more of economic history given how it focuses on reconstruction.

I am unsure of what comparison your making in particular, since both Western Europe as well as ROK and Japan both had wildly successful postwar economic booms thanks to the US. The Marshall Plan in the Europe helped economies there boom through what was essential large grants of money to the Western European countries. No where else was the US as heavily involved as reconstruction other then these two regions. Hence if the comparison is to countries in other areas the simple answer is that the US did not focus anywhere near as much effort there, hence less spectacular results.

Honestly, the success of both Western Europe's Economic reconstruction and Japan's had similar causes. As for the ROK it is slightly more complex due to the Korean War but in general it has the same few characteristic.

Firstly, it is the presence of US Aid. For Western Europe that was the Marshall Plan. For Japan it was the treaty of San Francisco that struck off the war reparations Japan needed to pay as well as investment from US firms into Japan through the 1950s and 1960s. Large Japanese cooperations know as Zaibatsus were allowed to reform despite being broken up by the occupation government as they were seen as being instruments for the Japanese War machine they were trying to dismantle. This helped to jump start their economy despite the war leaving it in ruins. Similarly, the ROK benefitted from this after the Korean War as there was a large influx of US aid and investment.

Next is the presence of US troops. Western European countries eventually benefitted from NATO and West Germany in particular hosted US forward based forces. This does help on the micro level of them spending money but in the big picture it means defence spending can be reduced given the strong US presence. The same can be said for Japan which wasn't allowed to have an armed forces for quite some time and relied on the US to defend them. This basically meant that during the Cold War where defence spending was going through the roof Japan didn't have to spend a single cent on it allowing them to use that money for the economy helping with their growth. Similarly South Korea also has US forward garrisons helping to alleviate some of their defense spending, although this did not have a very big impact given their leeve en masse policy.

That point may sound counter intuitive to thinking we are familiar with, but all the realpolitik aside, that was the political climate of the world at that time. They had just existed a World War, no country wanted to continue military spending (besides the USA and USSR due to political considerations) and they were seeking a climate of stability where they had dependable allies. So while it does seem ill-advised to reduce military spending and rely on forces of another country to defend you in the event of an attack that was the thinking at the time. And the US wanted to make it self known as a reliable ally in the context of the Cold War where more allies mean more prestige for them and less for the Soviets. Of course this only really persisted from the late 40s to the 1950s. Once the cold war escalated and even during detente spending was back up for a majority of countries. However this brief period immediately after WWII of reduced military spending helped towards their successful reconstruction.

Lastly, I would also like to add that the US is not entirely responsible for reconstruction being a success. Local governments in both the Far East and Western Europe played large roles. The Europeans developed the European Economic Community and adopted their own mixed economy plans. The Japanese had a large climate of political stability due to the ""Iron Triangle"" and geared themselves to becoming a heavily export focused economy. South Korea also similarly adopted a mixed economy and gear themselves to be export focused. This all contributed to their successful reconstruction. It's difficult to say which was more important since US aid was essential, but it was also the aid being used effectively by the recipient countries that created the economic miracles after the war. 

If your interested, I recommend further reading on the Japanese Economic Miracle for a more detailed explanation. If your interested in the general reconstruction after WWII you could also read up on the Marshall Plan and the Bretton Woods System which created the environment for the Golden Age of Captilaism, a title that has been assigned to the early post war era due to high sustained economic growth.

&gt; Dschinghis Khan (Pronounced ""Jingis"" Khan) was a German pop band, created in 1979 to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest. The name of the band is the German spelling of ""Genghis Khan"", and was chosen to fit the song of the same name, written and produced by Ralph Siegel with lyrics by Bernd Meinunger.

&gt; Appearing at the height of the disco boom and following on the heels of other German-produced bands such as Boney M., Arabesque, and Silver Convention, the band achieved wide popularity throughout the world, especially in Europe, Russia, and Japan, though they went wholly unnoticed in the United States. Their songs invariably were themed on historical figures and exotic cultures and locales.

&gt; Though the group broke up in the mid-1980s, it has enjoyed a recent resurgence in popularity on the internet due to a video of them performing their hit song Moskau being discovered. The video and the song associated with it have become a popular topic on blogs and websites. 

&gt; The original members of the group were:

&gt;     * Steve Bender (1942-2006)
    * Wolfgang Heichel
    * Henriette Heichel
    * Leslie Mándoki
    * Edina Pop
    * Louis Hendrik Potgieter (1951-1993)

&gt; The band re-formed in late 2005, with Stefan Track replacing Potgieter as the ""Khan"" character. They performed at the Olympiyski Arena in Moscow on October 17, 2005. On May 7th, 2006, Steve Bender (the member famous for his bald appearance) died of cancer.

&gt; The band, now under the name ""The Legacy of Dschinghis Khan"", has a tour scheduled for Winter 2006 - Fall 2007. In the tour, their show will consist of ""Cirque du Dschinghis Khan"", featuring other performers, including Mongolian circus acts. Their announced dates are listed on the official website of the group and are subject to change. Their planned German national tour dates in January 2007 will coincide with the release of their latest as-of-yet untitled LP and DVD. It will be their first release since 1999's ""Die Großen Erfolge"".

&gt; Their songs appear in the video games Taiko No Tatsujin, Pop'n Music, and Stepping Selection.

Paging u/white_light-king u/dandan_noodles u/Rittermeister Sorry to do that, but I figure since you were discussing my post you should hear what I have to say despite being late to this party. I am not trying to insult anyone (I'll try to keep sass and sarcasm to a minimum), but there is a lot to respond to and I don't want being concise to come off as rude. I’m going to reply to the entire thread, so this is going to require two posts. Unfortunately I have not read *The Bloody Crucible of Courage* (I tend to stick to campaign studies overall), though I have dealt with similar ideas about Civil War tactics through Caroline Reardon's work. My source list is now up, so let's jump in:

&gt;The army size comparison you're making is not relevant to the Civil war.
You're discussing the Mexican-American war, which was fought at a huge distance from the larger U.S. cities in a previous generation to the civil war. The reference to Napoleon's large armies also makes little sense, since at his peak Napoleon's army was not merely frenchmen.

The reason it appears irrelevant is because we are discussing two different levels of warfare. I explicitly noted that this was regular army size and that I was discussing strategic manpower mobilization and logistics. A regular army can crudely be thought of as modern active duty. So the guy on leave smooching with his sweetheart, the guy cleaning out his weapon after basic training, and the grizzled veteran manning a fort in a border area are all part of the regular army. Strength of Gradient based on area of operation does not matter when it comes to regular army size because, put bluntly, regular army size is a strategic (arguably grand strategic) concept and not an operational one. Its usefulness is that it gives a gauge of civilian bureaucracy (the ministry of war) cooperating with the military (army training and organization). The Prussians and French for example have about 1% of their population in the standing army at any time in the 1850s-70s and 1-2% as reservists. The Austrians, Russians, and British have different systems (the context is not worth going into), but their regular armies also are in the ballpark of at least 100,000 at any time. The US on the other hand has about 0.05% (16,000 out of 30 million on the eve of the Civil War) of its population as a standing army and it is incredibly difficult to quantify conscripts/reservists because, well they instead have an incredibly decentralized system of state militias and volunteers, and later conscription systems were incredibly tedious and complicated volunteer/conscript quotas (plus exemptions.

The reason for bringing up Napoleon is not to just toss around numbers but to point out that the United States and Europe operate in different contexts, specifically that Europe has been dealing with large-scale warfare for decades and have state bureaucracies/military establishments to support officers and soldiers conduct this kind of warfare effectively as a matter of policy. The Civil War by contrast is a bit out of the blue and highly irregular for the kind of warfare that the US traditionally engaged in. It’s not entirely surprising or controversial that the European military establishments would be better prepared for a type of conflict that they regularly face.

&gt;A better comparison might be the Franco-Austrian war of 1859. the Battle of Solferino was fought by about 120,000 to 130,000 french troops against a similar number of Austrian troops. This is roughly the same size as the largest Civil war engagement, Gettysburg. 
Overall, US Army strength in the Civil War was about 600,000 at any given point see NPS infographic which is very comparable, if not larger, to any European army of the 1850s or 1860s. The Austrians brought a similar troop number to the 1866 Austro-Prussian war, and the Prussians brought less. Of course, 600,000 is just the number that the US army had at any one time. 2.6 Million men were enlisted in the Union army over the course of the war making the ACW a huge conflict by European standards, if only because of it's length.

...sigh... ok, I'm going to sound like a broken record here, but I am not throwing around numbers to shock and awe you. I am using numbers to illustrate a point, that Europeans practiced large scale warfare for decades, and could deploy large trained armies within weeks of war breaking out. The United States couldn't because a) it did not regularly practice this kind of warfare (frontier warfare and operations with smaller North American powers was the standard) and b) it had neither the need nor the capability to employ this kind of state bureaucracy and military organization. The US would get there, but it would take far longer and its armies were far less prepared for battle. Simply saying that they had the same numbers is an incredibly tenuous comparison without interpreting what those numbers mean with regards to logistically how and when those numbers are acquired. In addition, throwing out 2.6 million men is a bit ridiculous considering this was the product of a 4 year civil war, not a contemporary European conflict which would see immediate mass mobilization and a single decisive campaign that could be measured in months if not weeks.

If we need an example, let’s go back to the Franco-Prussian War. Napoleon III receives the Ems dispatch July 14th, declares war July 19th and within ten days has the 200,000 man strong Army of the Rhine marching towards the German border, which they crossed at the beginning of August. And here is the thing, despite this, despite French superiority in rifles and repeating guns (though slightly behind in artillery), the French lose badly because the Germans mobilize upwards of 500,000 men by the second week of August and string together a stunning set of victories *in a decisive campaign* ending at Sedan on September 1 to not only beat the French, but collapse the Second Empire. The remainder of the war was a hodge-podge of French civil strife in forming the Third Republic (who would formally surrender by January) and Prussian occupation in response to the French collapse, but the main campaign was done within 3 months of the outbreak of the war. By contrast the first major confrontation of the Civil War was First Bull Run, with about 30,000 on each side, several *months* after the outbreak of war and after Lincoln had called for 70,000 volunteers. It would take several more months for the main armies to reach their full fighting strength. But even then, they would be messing around with fundamental stuff, like whether to distribute artillery batteries by brigade or division (which would be altered even by later Generals like Hooker). This isn’t changing military doctrine, because fundamentally there is no such thing, it is quite simply figuring out how to organize a functioning army.

It’s tempting to want to hand wave past all these strategic, logistical and organizational concerns to talk about technology/tactics where things are on more even ground, but we should resist this urge. Technology is often fairly close together between closely interacting nations, and I’d honestly say never more than around ten years apart in this period. But strategic and organizational concerns made up the backbone of most military efforts throughout history, were generally the decisive level of warfare in the period, and the US lacked the European tradition and establishment in this regard. Again, not surprising, but it is fundamentally an area where they are completely outmatched. I would strongly contest the idea that this is not important because “the US has repeatedly done this…” We have been long protected by thousands of miles of Atlantic Ocean that have screened us from dealing with continental European armies (especially during our most vulnerable periods) and our primary conflicts in the 19th century were fundamentally unconventional (the Indian Wars, Wars with the British or Spanish colonies). It worked out in the Civil War, because *both* sides were doing the same improvisational dance to get to large-scale warfare, but we should not project US military superiority/parity back beyond the 1920s-30s in any area beyond military technology. I don’t want to run into too many tangents, but I strongly contest the idea that training could be supplanted by a year of combat experience. Again, this worked because *both* sides were improvising in the same way, but most European conflicts were measured in months, if not weeks. More fundamentally, beyond the basics of equipment organization, organization, and formation, basic military training offers something to grasp onto in terms of command, cohesion, and morale during the heat of combat. Grossman’s *On Killing* is a good place to start for combat psychology even if some of his conclusions are a bit out there.

The point of a first strike is to take out the enemieis ability to respond.  IT's why it's so destabilizing.  The idea of winnable nuclear war.

France does not have first strike capability that would destroy Chinese fighting ability.  China would retaliate in conventional and nuclear ways, and France being much smaller in the middle of Europe, would be much more likely to be destroyed.

So France has a defensive capaibility to respond to a strike, but even if it all worked (which is a question mark), they could not take out a major power like Russia, China or the US in a first strike.

Having the US have the ability to take out the entire national defense and offensive power of China or Russia, for example, in a first strike scenario, has a very specific purpose.  It's to send the message that we are the top power, end of story.  It's totally psychological.

Now, let me explain the historical precedence of US military spending and why our spending is a conscious decision, not one haphazardly done.

**The Modern History of Defense Spending**

Believe it or not, in the wake of World War II, the US had a major debate over isolationism. There was a major drawdown in the military, with a lot of equipment mothballed or scrapped.

Stalin's actions in Eastern Europe and in Berlin (such as the Berline blockade) and China falling to the communists were all major areas of concern. The straw that broke the camel's back, however, was the Korean War: outright naked aggression by a communist state against another state in the post-WW2 world was just too much. The US used the newly created UN (which the USSR at the time was boycotting) to form a coalition of nations to fight North Korea. In the post-WW2 world, the UN was being tested: would it be toothless like the League of Nations, or would nations actually stand up and prevent wars of conquest?

This led to a [major revitalization of the US military](http://i.cfr.org/content/publications/July2014/009_national_defense_1928.png) which as you can see saw its post-WW2 spike in spending go up to 16% of GDP in the 1950s.

The necessity of a powerful military in the post-WW2 order was predicted by many. Notably, General Marshall, in his [Biennial Reports as Chief of Staff of the Army](http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/070/70-57/CMH_Pub_70-57.pdf), concluded before WW2 even ended that:

* Oceans were no longer enough to protect the US heartland
* Future defenses necessitated a strong forward deployed presence in the world
* Technological superiority would have to exist as post-conflict mobilization and innovation cost a lot of lives 

A particularly poignant passage is when he mentions that, if not for British and Soviet lives holding the line, as well as major blunders by the enemy, the US would have suffered a lot lot more. And that, had the Axis won, interviews with Goring and other Nazi leadership showed that by 1947, the East Coast of the US would have been subject to attacks by long range Nazi weapons.

Even Ike, in his famed 'military industrial complex' speech - which gets taken out of context - actually prefaced that [line with his passage](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/ike.htm):

&gt;A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.

&gt;Our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime, or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea.

&gt;Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. 

Does all of that sound familiar? Because it should: the US military establishment has been purposefully designed to meet the challenges that General Marshall, Eisenhower, and other top military and political leaders have realized.

We are interested in *global* and *full-spectrum* warfare. A vital part of our defense strategy, in the world of long range missiles, supersonic jets, and precision weapons, is to put our front line of defense across those oceans. Bases in Japan, Korea, and Europe, aren't just there because our allies have hostile forces close by, but also because the further away from the US the conflict is, the more layers of defense any foe has to get through to affect the US directly.

Full spectrum isn't just a catch phrase either: the US is interested in every aspect of warfare from human intelligence to special warfare to ground warfare to air superiority to space superiority. Whereas in the Cold War, NATO allies often focused on specializing in specific areas due to their small size and lack of funding (e.g. the UK was particularly focused on anti-submarine warfare), the US was designed to be not only the bulk of conventional forces but also charged with handling all areas that other nations lacked: logistics (e.g. the US currently has over 230 strategic airlift transports and over 430 aerial refueling tankers - the rest of NATO has about 10 strategic airlift transports and 40 tankers), submarines, bombers, etc.

Even our current aircraft carrier fleet is set to 11 ships by design. Why 11?

* Each aircraft carrier is nuclear powered. With a 50-year lifespan, each carrier goes into drydock at the 25 year mark for its reactor's refueling
* The refueling process is complex and lengthy, and takes 2-3 years to complete at which time the ship goes through major repairs and overhauls to stay relevant the next 25 years
* At the end of said overhaul, another 1-2 years are put on the ship for testing and what not
* With each carrier produced at a staggered 4-5 year interval, at any given time, one of our 11 carriers is out of service
* One carrier is permanently forward deployed to Japan
* Carriers are operated in 18 month cycles broken into 6 month periods. There is a six month deployment followed by six months mostly at home giving crew rest and doing minor repairs and maintenance, and six months in training for the next deployment.
* Nine stateside carriers = 3 rotations of 3 ships rotating inside those 18 month cycles
* Not coincidentally, we have a Pacific Ocean to care about, an Atlantic Ocean to care about, and an Indian Ocean that Congress mandates we care about. The President can truly ask ""where are my carriers"" any day of the year at any time.

As I said, *this is by design*. 

But why you ask? Why is all of this necessary? Good question. Let me explain:

**Your Answer to Spending is Answered in the National Security Strategy**

Since Eisenhower, the US has pegged spending against the National Security Strategy of each successive presidential administration. During the Cold War, the general US strategy was: ""win two major wars at any time"" - largely believed to mean the USSR in Europe and China in Asia.

An [archive of NSS's](http://nssarchive.us/) since Reagan is available here.

When the Cold War ended, President Clinton changed the strategy to ""win hold win"" - win one war, hold the line in another, then win that war when the first one concludes. The NSS also was no longer focused specifically on Russia and China. Correspondingly, the US military shrank from 3 million active + reserve to 2.1 million active + reserve. The US carrier fleet went from no fewer than 15 at any time during the Cold War to a necking down to 11 by the mid 2000's. The US anti-submarine patrol force, for instance, was cut in half overnight in the mid 90s.

In the 2000's, Bush changed it to ""1-4-2-1"" - protect the homeland first, deter aggression in four regions of the world simultaneously, be able to sustain combat operations in two of them, and win one of those decisively.

When Obama took office, he made a major change. First was the 'Pivot to the Pacific' - largely meant to counter China. As a result, the US refocused its efforts on buying conventional high-tech weaponry to face a resurgent and growing Chinese foe, after two decades of neglect or diverted attention under Clinton and Bush (weapons made to fight guys in pickup trucks don't do so well against actual conventional foes).

And in 2015, the NSS was amended again: this time with a refocusing on Russia after their actions in Crime and the Ukraine. Again, instead of arresting defense spending, the President actually asked for more money that year ($630 billlion) than the GOP Congress gave ($610 billion) or what the DOD requested ($580 billion).

(On that note, if you weren't sure, Ishould tell you that budgeting is made by the DOD, amended by the President, and then sent to Congress for voting in).

Lord knows what President Trump wants to do with our National Security Strategy.

As I wrote, since WW2, there has been a *conscious* decision to shape our military size and capabilities. We concluded after WW2 that we could not sit back and wait to build up modern equipment after aggression has happened, that we need to keep the frontlines overseas, and that we are the only Western nation demographically and economically capable of facing China and Russia.

And that's ultimately what it all comes down to: our spending can be either too much or too little based on what we as a country want to do with our strategy.

My grandpa was in Europe for WW2, and was scheduled to head over to the Battle of the Bulge when he took a friendly bullet to his penis, and got sent back home to the states.

He bought a boat, and met his wife one day when a friend brought his girlfriend down to the docks to get a ride on said boat.  When the ride was over, she was my grandfather's girlfriend.  They went on to marry, and despite his war injury, they had four children.

He worked as a firefighter in Duluth, MN, and he told me a story about heading down into the basement of a burning building.  He said that all he could see in that basement was blackness, due to the smoke being so thick.  He quickly became disoriented and no longer knew which direction was towards the exit.  As thoughts of the end started to creep into his head, he said that a gloved hand reached through the smoke, grabbed a hold of him, and dragged him to safety.  He told me that this was the day he knew that God was real.

Later on, his wife took her own life.  Unfortunately, this is a story that people in my family don't repeat the details to very often.  My grandfather told me that this was the day he became an atheist.

He had a heart attack in his mid eighties and didn't go to the hospital until five days later, when he could no longer put his own pants on.  He drove himself there.

He died trying to get one of those cheap-ass plastic kiddie swimming pools into the back of his pick-up truck.  Got his 87 year old ass up on the tailgate and fell off, right onto the pavement.  Shattered a hip and smacked his head something fierce.  When the paramedics showed up and asked him what hurt, his reply was ""My dignity."".  He then lapsed into a coma and never woke up.

I will always be inspired by him for his sheer resistance to becoming someone bound by a wheelchair or stuck in a nursing home.  He was doing normal adult stuff right up until his last breath, and while I'm sad about his passing no doubt, it makes me happy knowing that he lived how he wanted and made life his bitch.

&gt; That still doesn't get you away from the point that you were wrong in saying that Chinese are as tall as the poorest countries in Europe. Fact is, even the poorest country of Europe, Moldova, is richer than China used to be. Either way, your statement had no basis.

Umm, I said this

&gt;&gt; If you only look at younger generations of Asians, thus discounting famine factor, the height of Asians are basically equivalent to European countries of equivalent standards of living.

Not sure how you interpret it as ""Chinese are as tall as the poorest countries in Europe"".

&gt; That's still excluding Cyprus, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Syria and Yemen as not being listed.

What the fuck??? Because when you cited Korean or Japanese or Chinese or Taiwanese numbers, you were using the general population, not the youth population. I cited middle eastern general population to compare the range you reported.

&gt; Even if you limit it to China-Korea-Japan-Taiwan, that still means the average height is only about 5' 6.5""-5' 7"" by your own link

If you start using the same comparison of only China-Korea-Japan-Taiwan youths (to your numbers of Middle easterner youths), that range becomes 5' 7''-5' 9''.

Taiwan	171.4 cm (5 ft 7 1⁄2 in)

South Korea - Seoul	173.9 cm (5 ft 8 1⁄2 in)

China, People's Republic of – Beijing	174.7 cm (5 ft 9 in)

Japan	172.0 cm (5 ft 7 1⁄2 in)

---

&gt; Except it's not as important as you think. 20-40% is still a very large factor, 

Except 20%-40% dwarves the few inches between Asian and Europeans, which are like 5% of the total difference?

&gt; and no doubt serious malnutrition can stunt a child's growth, but beyond malnutrition for the first 2 years, neither diet or socioeconomic status had any significant impact in the height of children.

Except that's another study contradicted it right afterwards.

&gt; Malnutrition in children younger than 2 years old will cause stunted growth in comparison with their parents and well-fed siblings, but malnourished children can ""catch up” with proper nutrition. A study included in “The Journal of Nutrition” monitored the height of 2,000 Filipino children, aged 2 to 12 years, from poor environments. The researcher found that about 63 percent were classified as “stunted” based on height-for-age (HAZ) measurements set by the World Health Organization. With increased caloric and vitamin intake, 30 percent were no longer stunted by the age of 8.5 years, and 32.5 percent were no longer stunted at 12 years old.

It means not all children can catch up the missed growth during their malnutritioned period below age of 2.

And your article stop looking at the children after the age of 12, when puberty growth spurt starts.

Also, that article is crap. ""An article appearing in “The Journal of Nutrition” monitored diet and socio-economic parameters in more than 2,000 Filipino children."" It doesn't link to the actual study",t5_2qqjc,,deeizga,t3_5w4227,

Obviously many of them were under Ottoman domination (which people like to forget was a thing, it always amuses me how people talk about pre WWI middle east as if it was a collection of free states), even still I don't know if it would be fair to say those rules were Ottoman based and not based on religion/local culture.

So basically if we're only including Christian European imperialism, even if we count post Ottoman fall dominated countries, you still have: Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Iran (being transgender OK as long as you are willing to get a sex change, everything else very, very illegal),  Afghanistan, and Saudi Arabia.   At the very least, I ran out of energy for googling and double checking at Saudi Arabia.    If you open that up to include post WWI protectorates that list gets way longer.  But my point is, in general, you can't lump it all in together like that.  Christianity was used as a tool of imperialism so it is easy to see the connections of anti-gay laws in Christian countries being tied to imperialism.  And it's also for the most part, likely correct.  But Muslim countries affected by imperialism, in general, were being dominated by other Muslim countries or dominated by Christian countries late in the game so the Christian countries forcing them to create anti-gay laws argument doesn't really play out as well.

 For example: Affirmative action hurts asians and whites, despite them usually scoring higher academically than blacks and latinos. With the average scores going like: Asians&gt;Whites&gt;Latinos&gt;Blacks. On average of course.

So I've got a question for you Mr my success is attributed to white privilege. Why do asians, indians, and several other ethnicities in the US have higher average wages than white americans? The average wage of an indian american is over $100k while a white person is $60k for example. 

If systematic racism is such an issue, then why would the white supremacist shadow government allow such things like affirmative action? Freedoms for all races and religions? Using taxpayer money to import minorities from other countries, even though there is clearly no benefit for the current population?

But you know, maybe if we just give away all our wealth via white privilege tax to poor oppressed blacks thatll fix it.

Once whites are demographically eliminated or down to less than 10% of the population of europe and north america in 100 years, minorites will still cry racist and oppression.

How is it that jewish people, one of the most oppressed people in the world persecuted and murdered for thousands of years, which suffered through a genocidal holocaust less than a century ago, do so well collectively? Make up less than 2% of the US population, but make up 48% of americas top 1%. How can a group that has been harmed do so well? 
Maybe its because collectively they arent failures like some other people stupid cucks like you try to shift blame onto other people. Some people, and some cultures. Are just better in western society. No amount of wealth distribution or affirmative action. Will. Change. That.

Eh, I used hyperbole to make a point and I never quantified ""dwarfed"" in any concrete way. And my point still remains true - even by Beijing standards, I'm 4 inches taller than the average and definitely taller than about 92% of the adult population. Use the national average and that number climbs higher still.

I initially said 99% because I conversationally generalized all of Asia, including the South East, who generally are shorter than Chinese, Japanese and Taiwanese. Then I backpedaled when the conversation turned to China specifically because I recognized that they were, in fact, taller than Filipinos, Thais, Indonesians and Malays from my anecdotal experiences.

&gt; I responded multiple times that it is due to nutrition and diet.

Yeah, and I rebutted, citing sources. I'll dig up some more China-specific ones if you're not satisfied. I'm sure it has a factor in it, but the scientific consensus is that genetics is the deciding factor in height more than diet.

In any case, the fact that we're having a conversation about the *cause* of Chinese people being shorter still means that you completely conceded to my main point that indeed, *they are fucking shorter* without having enough balls to admit as much directly.

&gt; Too long. Waste of time to reply. Just stop believing in these retarded richard lynn bullshit bio truth about race.

That's nice.

&gt; Lmao @ havne't proved you wrong.

Where's the part where you conclusively prove Chinese people as equally tall to Europeans? Any part where you actually refute my main point in any meaningful way? No? Okay then.

Fine. I will concede that Trump knows people who have worked with the Russians (as he probably knows people who've worked with damn near every country on the planet).
Now that we've got that established we need to put the Dems under a microscope... so here we go!
From 2009-2011 Hillary Clinton received $2.5 Million dollars from the Russian government. This money went to her foundation, and shortly after, she granted Russians the rights to America's uranium mines. Forget the 20% number or whatever and just think about the previous statement.
A Secretary of State of the United States personally took money from a foreign government and in return granted them ownership over America's strategic resources. YES THAT HAPPENED. Even the hyper liberal failing NTY reported on it
As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million.
So WHO is the Russian puppet here?
Now let's look at another prominent Democrat. John Pedosta. The Chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign owned stock (75,000 shares roughly) in a Russian energy company called Joules Unlimited.
Thanks to the Panama Papers, we know that the Podesta Group (founded by John Podesta’s brother, Tony) lobbied for Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank. “Sberbank is the Kremlin, they don’t do anything major without Putin’s go-ahead, and they don’t tell him ‘no’ either,” explained a retired senior U.S. intelligence official. According to a Reuters report, Tony Podesta was “among the high-profile lobbyists registered to represent organizations backing Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.” Among these was the European Center, which paid Podesta $900,000 for his lobbying.
That’s not all: The busy Podesta Group also represented Uranium One, a uranium company acquired by the Russian government which received approval from Hillary Clinton’s State Department to mine for uranium in the U.S. and gave Russia twenty percent control of US uranium.
So what does this mean? Podesta lobbied Russian banks and was working for the Russians in the Uranium One deal. Since Uranium is considered a strategic resource and implicitly a component of national security, the only way for the US to cede rights to their strategic resources was through the State Department headed by..... Hillary Clinton.
Podesta, working on behalf of Putin, facilitates the Uranium One deal by funneling money from the Russian government directly into the Clinton's slush fun- ...err ""Foundation"". (How is this not the biggest scandal in American history?)
So Podesta and Clinton have direct indisputable financial and political ties to Vladimir Putin. This makes them not only massive hypocrites for trying to tie Trump to the Russians, but also implicates both John Pedosta and HRC in massive, illegal money laundering schemes from foreign nations.

That much we know with 100% certainty.
So here is the final thing I want you to think about. Let's say the Russians really did hack the DNC. Let's say they broke into her private server and intentionally leaked damaging evidence to Wikileaks to influence the election. Anyone with a brain knows it was Seth Rich who leaked, but for hypothetical purposes we will say Russia did this to destroy Hillary's trust with the American voter directly leading to her loss and inevitable diminished influence around the world... let's say ALL THIS IS TRUE.
If Clinton, Podesta and Putin were cozy enough to sign secretive massive deals together - enough so to feel comfortable committing high crimes against the citizens of the United States, ask yourselves...

Não existe *o regime* fascista.
Fascismo não é uma forma de governo.
Fascismo é uma forma de pensar e agir. É uma filosofia de governo. Parecido com uma ideologia, mas mais abrangente e menos rigorosa que uma ideologia.

Houve, e há, na história, vários governos que podem ser considerados fascistas. Alguns mais rigorosos, outros menos. Mas todos de acordo com os pontos que eu coloquei acima. Exemplos: Coreia do Norte, Egito (muito mais light), Síria na época do Assad-pai, mas sem os elementos etnicos supremacistas. Alemanha nazista, o próprio governo do Mussolini. O Chavismo demonstra vários elementos fascistas também.

Existem vários líderes, em vários lugares do mundo que apresentam fortes tendências fascistas (sempre de acordo com os pontos que eu levantei antes). Aqui em Israel, a ministra Miri Regev, deputado Betzalel Smotrich. Nos EUA, supremacistas brancos, KKK, por exemplo. O Erdogan na Turkia tem fortíssimas tendências fascistas.

Fascismo tem muito a ver com populismo. O apoio da população e a criação do ódio sobre as minorias são fatores determinantes na criação de um governo de viés fascista. Pode ser de direita ou esquerda. Pode ser pseudo-captalista ou pseudo-comunista.

Explain to me how religion makes you bad at math.  Look, I'm an atheist, but that doesn't mean that I think less of people JUST because they believe in god.  I couldn't fucking care less what goes on in a person's head.  For fuck's sake, I have phobias that make no earthly sense, and I'm one of the most neurotic people on the planet.

I don't even know what that last sentence means.  Are you arguing that people can't congregate in churches or are you saying that you don't want education to be saddled with religious teachings?  If it's the latter, that's already a thing.  In public schools in the U.S., you're not allowed to preach anything regarding religion.  If you're referring to the former, and saying churches should be banned, you're stepping into some pretty dangerous territory.

I have read quite a lot on the topic and what I view as nationalsm encompasses the range between Patriotism and Jingoism. So even if I am specifically a patriot I am still a nationalst. I am just not ashamed of using the real word.

&gt;And do you see the default state of the world to be nations in struggle/competition?

In a closed society yes. We are limited to one planet with no external foes. We are bound to struggle between one another. The only way for world peace to be achieved is if some magical aliens attack us and the world unites to the external threat. It is just human nature imo. I am also very much against creating more structures with national oversight without direct accountability of the people. For example the EU. They have such a strong legislative grip after Lisbon (with the exception of taxes) but for regular people ti is next to impossible to protest against them. Especially those outside of Brussels. I especially detest the european council/commission relationship. In Europe you have a plurality of political opinions. It is really rare for a party to get 40%+  of the total vote. So the prime ministers of most countries come from parties with sub 30% local support.

That's not how it works. No pill is ever sold ""at a loss"" because production costs are always negligible. The question is whether sales without American price gouging would be able to recuperate sunk research costs for a given drug.

Say I want to spend $40M to develop a drug. I project that I will make $20M revenue from Europe and $30M revenue from the USA. That means $10M profit. Project is a go.

Now let's say US reforms its healthcare system and I don't get to gouge prices anymore. Now I'm looking at the same $50M investment with $20M profit from Europe and $20M from the USA. Not profitable anymore. Project gets killed and the world has one less drug.

Obviously that's very simplified and real life will be more complex, but it's just illustrating the fact that more profits = more supply. It's a fundamental economic fact.

&gt;Also, if we look at your chart linked (not sure what it is of, to be honest), the top four or so countries are pretty equal when you work it out per capita. You would expect more research to go on in America. It is a fucking huge country. UK is carrying out a quarter of the amount of research with a quarter of the amount of the population. Every country on that list. Well, USA through to Germany, didn't check beyond that, seems to be pulling its weight.

This argument is a misdirect anyway. German and English drug manufacturers sell to the USA. The question isn't so much ""where the research happens"" as it is ""where the money for the research comes from.""

I don't believe we should be sacrificing people's lives through unaffordable healthcare in order to stimulate the pharma industry, so this argument is still a miss for me, but I think people are a bit ignorant to pretend there's *nothing* to it.",t5_2tk95,,deeoxg1,t3_5wo9xk,

Sure, more of the same. Generalisation after generalisation. This is why ""the people"" don't like the EU. Guess you must be some kind of prophet knowing what the European people think.

""Germans"". Yep, all of them, or is it the most, a few, many? We must be all the same to you.

So to sum it up. Just like every other guy who is anti-EU (I am assuming you are) you try to start a debate by throwing opinions around and generalising to the max. Everything is black and white and all problems can be solved by a few ""simple measures"".

• 31 per cent of British Muslims support the right of a man to have more than one wife

• 52 per cent of Muslims did not believe that homosexuality should be legal

This is something I posted before so its a copy paste but relevant:

&gt;I posted the other day about the difference between when Monty Python made Life of Brian and the Danish cartoons to illustrate the need for Islam to 'calm the fuck down':

&gt;Christopher Hitchens on the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy:

&gt;[""nobody in authority can be found to state the obvious and the necessary—that we stand with the Danes against this defamation and blackmail and sabotage. Instead, all compassion and concern is apparently to be expended upon those who lit the powder trail, and who yell and scream for joy as the embassies of democracies are put to the torch in the capital cities of miserable, fly-blown dictatorships. Let's be sure we haven't hurt the vandals' feelings.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_reactions_to_the_Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy#Violent_protests)


&gt;Compared to when Monty Python released Life of Brian:

&gt; [In New York (the film's release in the US preceded British distribution), screenings were picketed by both rabbis and nuns (""Nuns with banners!"" observed Michael Palin).
in February 2007, the Church of St Thomas the Martyr in Newcastle upon Tyne held a public screening in the church itself, with song-sheets, organ accompaniment, stewards in costume and false beards for female members of the audience (alluding to an early scene where a group of women disguise themselves as men so that they are able to take part in a stoning). Although the screening was a sell-out, some Christian groups, notably the conservative Christian Voice, were highly critical of the decision to allow the screening to go ahead. Stephen Green, the head of Christian Voice, insisted that ""You don't promote Christ to the community by taking the mick out of him."" The Reverend Jonathan Adams, one of the church's clergy, defended his taste in comedy, saying that it did not mock Jesus, and that it raised important issues about the hypocrisy and stupidity that can affect religion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python's_Life_of_Brian#Religious_satire_and_blasphemy_accusations)

Popcorn. 

&gt; This is about the white Americans who did something inhumane. 

Native Americans got fucked over, yeah. No arguments on that. The problem is that you're taking that and turning it into this idea that white people are sociopathic - end of story. Which is really just silly, when you really stop to think about it.

There were a lot of white people who liked Natives right from the start. Same with vice versa. People *like* other people, and most would prefer to foster a respectful curiosity for one another if given the opportunity.

&gt; Learning about native American culture doesn't change a thing. You are understanding everything wrong.

Learning about the Native American perspective changes EVERYTHING. They left for the New World, and we didn't see each other again for 15,000 YEARS.

- A precious metals exploitation cartel and/or company/bank: If there were huge shorts in the Silver market, a silver backed currency would totally screw over the ones with shorted-positions on that market as the value of silver would increase.
- At the same time banks invested into the success of a defaltionary gold backed currency (which was all of them), would get screwed over (if they were involved in gold+silver double whammy). With a silver backed currency there would be an injection of a lot of new legal tender (new money supply) driving up inflation, driving down the value of gold as a result plus a lot of other unforeseen ""chaos"" in the market.
- The US citizenry also sat on a lot of silver after the coinage act of 1873, ultimately giving power to the peasants.

This is probably the biggest factor:

- From 1750 to 1870, wars within Europe as well as an ongoing trade deficit with China (which sold to Europe but had little use for European goods) drained silver from the economies of Western Europe and the United States.

The fear was probably that the US would be transferring a LOT of (trading) power to the ones they had sold it to during that time without them lifting a finger. 

A historical parallel to back this hypothesis is when French president Charles de Gaulle started exchanging the dollar in for gold in the 1970s. Nixon shut it down because it started to reduce the US-es financial influence; the US was strained being in a war along with other financial issues.  

Why was US trading influence so big? Because of the Bretton woods agreement that made other countries reliant on trading in dollars, pegged on gold, in the wake of the second world war. ""It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain one"" *-- American Economist, Barry Eichengreen*

Sadly many nationalists ""know"" what GERS includes even though they have apparently never read it. GERS includes £2.802 billion of debt interest, not £5 billion. How can you come up with such a figure?

&gt; We know Defense Spending charges Scotland about £1.5bn more than similar sized nations (and NATO can go fuck itself over 2% especially with Scotland's strategic position - Iceland pays 0.1%). 

Defence spending in GERS is £3.03 billion. Norway spends $7.2 billion. Scotland's spending is higher than many other countries, although defence spending looks set to increase across Europe.

&gt;We know that the National Infrastructure Plan could be costing Scotland up to £6bn a year for nothing.

That's another thing you apparently ""know"" from GERS that isn't included. The National Infrastructure Plan doesn't affect GERS. GERS counts spending on infrastructure that the Scottish government believes benefits Scotland. Crossrail, London sewers etc are not counted as Scottish spending.

The Scottish government believes 2% of the spending on HS2 will benefit Scotland, so allocates 2% of the budget in GERS. That's currently about £8 million a year.

&gt;But here's the rub for British Nationalists. The Yes Campaign doesn't have to prove ANY of this. All they need is to create a reasonable enough explanation for 200,000 people to switch their vote or 400,000 Unionists to stay at home (or a combination - again thinking of single magic bullets is naive).

You mean you could win with fake news? Possibly, although the promise of £8 billion in oil revenue wasn't enough last time.

But the point is that no matter what you manage to convince people of, the facts don't change. Scotland would still face a financial catastrophe on the same scale as Greece. What would happen if people felt they were conned into that by nationalists?

In fact, what happens at the 2021 election if the independence deal isn't finalised, the public believes the SNP lied to them, and Scotland is facing financial disaster? What happens if the unionists win?

&gt;Unionism will need a compelling narrative to hold off Independence in 2018 - something to argue for rather than against. And despite all the time they have had, none has so far appeared.

&gt; * BRUSSELS -- European Union legislators have lifted the EU parliamentary immunity of French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen for tweeting pictures of acts of violence perpetrated by the Islamic State (IS) militant group.

&gt; * Le Pen, who leads her National Front party in the EU parliament, is under investigation in France for posting three graphic images of IS executions on Twitter in December 2015.

&gt; * Le Pen's parliamentary immunity shields her from prosecution.

&gt; * Le Pen is leading the polls for the first round of the presidential election but is expected to lose in the second-round run-off.

The EU is not involved.  It is the European Parliament.


&gt; What I'd want to know is.. if she wasn't on a path to get on the second ballot, would the EU remove her immunity and/or would the French prosecute?

The EU has not removed her immunity.  The members of the European Parliament voted for her to have her immunity from prosecution removed at France's request.

France has requested this because they claim the pictures she has posted break an equivalent of French Obscenity laws and they claim she is using them to incite violence etc.  Whether that is true or not is up to the courts to decide - which I think is fair.  Accused of something?  Go to court. Maybe she'll be found not guilty.  I dunno.  That's for a jury or judge to decide.

The problem was that as a MEP, she was *immune* from prosecution. Essentially she could swing from the rafters shouting ""KILL THE MUSSIES!"" (but in French, I suppose) and they couldn't touch her.  Evidently she's annoyed enough people that they voted to remove her immunity.  

They've not declared her guilty of anything.  The EU is not involved.  The European Parliament is not prosecuting her.

I understand that you are more concerned with what happens in America, but you seemed to base the evidence for your argument on the fact that migrants are exploiting the welfare states of EU countries, and putting stress on their social security systems. Hence, America can't have what you desire (what you called ""a proper welfare state"") because migrants would exploit it and put stress on it, just like they have in Europe.

So, you are talking about all migrants. In that case, what id like you to expand upon is:

1) how are migrants from non-EU countries exploiting and putting stress on welfare states in Western Europe? (I assume you are referring to the Western European countries?)

 
2) how are intra-eu migrants exploiting and putting stress on western European welfare states?

I understand your point when you say there is a lot of information, but those are big claims to make without backing them up! They can also be interpreted in different ways, so I'd like to know where you're coming from and what makes you make these arguments.

**Edit**: Would any other nimble navigators like to chime in here? I think this is really important, because I want to know where you guys are coming from.

You're right, they are and are likely to continue to oppose Brexit up to and including the point where the Scottish Parliament submits an EU membership application to Brussels. However, the Remain side tended to be a pretty left-wing claim. The Scots Nats, I would argue, are also the most right-wing party to be interested in the idea of EU membership, and as you noted yourself, the other pro-EU parties in England specifically are in tatters. Labour because it elected a leader who in terms of ideology was good, in my opinion, but in terms of charisma, personality, perspective and bravado was terrible, the Lib Dems were eviscerated while being defenestrated by the Tories for five years and have yet to even remotely recover, and the other left-wing parties have been kept down by Labour for the past seventy-odd years.

&gt;Is it? He was called low T. People assumed that he was a woman. You said that assumption was not unreasonable. You then called him overly emotional. You then doubled down on that and said that this was not a ''normal'' male position and have continued to do so.
This is not a strawman. And if you are calling it a strawman -- you are hamstering abt the meaning of your words.

Because you think I'm shaming him for it, I'm not! 

&gt;It is not a fact. It is what I have observed with the vast majority of men I have encountered. There is pressure for men to be perceived as ''unemotional'' and so they pretend that they're not. Men, ime, are a lotttt more emotional about sex than women are.

You had sex as a job, of course you will feel more distant about sex or were you bonding with every client? So your view is a bit biased. 

If that's true why are women calling me telling me they felt used because I didn't contact them 24 hours after sex. Almsot al of my friends prefer to have sex in their houses, simply because we can't leave after we're done.

&gt;Again, I am saying that men would do well not to believe their friends. The ''macho'' guys who want ''no connection'' frequently turn to mush when they are actually with a woman. Half the guys who ''booked with friends to have a lay'' didn't even have sex with me. They just chatted and got me to stroke their hair, ffs. It's hilarious to observe the difference bt/wn what men say they want and what they actually want.

lol.

&gt;You have to go there. That is something that needs to be arranged. You have to arrange payment, generally in cash if you don't want that on your bank records. You have to make sure that there's a girl in who's your type. You have to organise your dick/make sure you're in good health or you'll get turned away. You may even have to organise cialis because performance issues abound in brothels.

Lol Where are you from again that makes hard to get cash? This is not a problem and never was at least in Europe. Lol Just no, only preparation is shower, car, brothel. 

Again this is selection bias. You're probably used to some weird incel guys.

&gt;I thought these were men who had no trouble getting laid? My friends can pull on tinder in the same day pretty consistently if they want to. It's not a &lt;10% chance for them. You swipe, you chat, she comes over, she fucks you and she leaves. It's way easier.

Good to your friends, I can get consistently 4 days after first contact, because you know, logistics. Before that would take me a great amount of effort. 

&gt;Not necessarily. But they are a very, very small minority of men (esp men who don't want to cuddle. Men are cuddle fiends, far moreso than women). It is strange that on the internet these guys shout down guys who are actually normal and make them feel abnormal.

Again, strawmen. I'm not shaming or shouting anyone, I just said it's not normal to say that as a men.

&gt;""(esp men who don't want to cuddle. Men are cuddle fiends, far moreso than women""
You have to stop spiting those facts out of thin air.

You don't think your old profession had a bias of the type of men you would get? Before you say my friends would also fit, I don't really think their type is the majority.

&gt;Also, my experience is that they generally are defective. That's it -- my experience. Men who are looking to be ''emotionally removed'' during a sexual encounter view sex as a conquest/ego boost, not a pleasurable experience that they come at with the intention of fully enjoying.

So they don't fit your definition of sex, so they're defective? 

Any man who has a full boner during sex is somehow enjoying himself. Whatever his motives are.

&gt;Again, this is my experience. YMMV. But I have had sex with a lot of people, I have good points of comparison &amp; this has been fairly obvious to me. Out of 50+ dudes how many didn't want to cuddle, talk about their feelings or ''connect'' in some way? 2 or 3. It is very rare.

You don't think that makes your view biased? if you're getting paid, it makes sense, you will see mostly that type of men. The only times I cuddle in casual sex it so it doesn't make me look like I just used her.

Did too many crazy shit with my friends to know none of us were needing a touch or any kind of bonding. Most of us the, core are single or with ldr so it doesn't really feel like any of us need bonding of any kind.",t5_2ya42,redpill,deeri4k,t3_5wnxek,

Não sei quais são seus pontos fortes e fracos na assimilação, mas recomendo você usar aquela modalidade de aula que você se sente mais confortável. Nem todo mundo se dá bem com vídeo-aula, seja no YouTube ou em outro site por aí, nem com aula presencial, tem gente que gosta de pausar pra fazer anotação a vontade. 

Adotar estratégias de assimilação é bom pra minimizar o esforço , seja você dando aula pra si mesmo, falando no espelho, ou só anotando incessantemente. O importante é a informação manter-se, mesmo depois de bastante tempo. Mas sem exagerar pra não causar problemas. Eu recomendo a estratégia pomodoro de estudo, é fácil, simples e eficiente. 

E prática. Fazer questão. MUUUITA QUESTÃO. Todas as questões do ENEM de todos os anos até então, e de universidades, sejam particulares ou públicas. Se o seu colégio/cursinho/estudo em casa (caso não vá pra nenhuma instituição ter aulas) não fizer simulados focados na avaliação que você quer, recomendo que tome quatro horas do seu sábado e quatro horas e meia do seu domingo pra fazer. Imprima um caderno de questões (tem sites que fazem) e mande brasa. 

Eu sei que é um período de muita pressão, que inevitavelmente leva a nervosismo e um resultado insatisfatório se essas emoções não forem bem gerenciadas, portanto se você ainda não sabe manejar esses sentimentos na hora da prova, recomendo conhecer métodos pra manejar o estresse durante esse evento. Isso vai te ajudar na vida toda, seja na área acadêmica na hora de apresentar e ser avaliado, seja na carreira profissional na hora de manejar pessoal e ser responsável por grandes projetos/maquinário caro. 

Por fim, é necessário uma válvula de escape pra tudo isso. Difícil ter nervos de aço pra aguentar isso por um ano inteiro e ficar intacto. Fazer uma coisa que você realmente goste e te relaxe bem também é  essencial. Nessa parte é que é importante ter uma família e/ou namorada que te dê apoio e compreenda a jornada árdua que será se você fizer as coisas dessa forma. É praticamente um sacerdócio, mas que vale a pena. (não que o sacerdócio não valha a pena, você entendeu :V)

EDIT: Não se esqueça de dormir e de se alimentar bem também! Se a dieta não for completa, recomendo vitaminas (tinha um Centrum específico pra isso, se não me engano), e muita água. Tem uma dieta específica que dizem que melhora o foco mental, a dieta Keto.",t5_2qh9i,,deersg1,t3_5x2qvs,

EDIT 2: I GOT A RESPONSE!!

Dear *****:
 
Thank you for contacting me about Russia’s relationship with the United States. I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts on this important issue.               
 
There have been reports of contact between Russian officials and the Trump Administration.  Most recently, it has come to light that Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with Russian officials.  It is still unclear in what capacity he did so.  On February 13, 2017, Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned stating that he had given incomplete information regarding a telephone call he had with the Russian ambassador weeks before President Trump’s inauguration. On December 29, 2016, Flynn, a former lieutenant general who had been selected as Trump's national security adviser, spoke with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions and the possibility of relieving them once Trump was in office. 
 
With respect to our foreign policy, I believe that the world becomes an unstable place when America fails to provide global leadership. In Eastern Europe, Ukraine continues to struggle against internal strife created by Russian external pressure. In February of 2014, protesters toppled the pro-Russian national government of Ukraine and elected a government desiring closer ties to the European Union and the West. Shortly following the transition of government, unmarked armed activists supported by Russian President Vladimir Putin seized a number of strategic locations across Crimea, an autonomous region in southern Ukraine. Despite sanctions directed against Russia, the country has continued to disrupt Ukrainian natural sovereignty. 
 
There is no pacifying Putin and time has shown that he rejects our values and refuses to be a cooperative partner. I oppose Russian aggression against the world and will not relinquish the gains that our Cold War victory achieved. However, I will not close the door on any potential relationship that makes Americans and the world safer.
 
Congress takes very seriously the implication that administrative officials had illegal contact with agents of the Russian State as well as any actions that Russia may have taken during our election. Congress has a continuing investigation into Russian activities and it is our responsibility to look very carefully at the actions that took place to make sure that there are no conjectures about what may have happened.  I want proper oversight conducted by Congress. Specifically, this means that the process cannot be rushed to the point that mistakes can be made or connections can be overlooked. 
 
On March 1, 2017, the House Intelligence Committee announced that they have approved the Scope of Investigation for the inquiry by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence into the Russian active measures campaign targeting the 2016 U.S. election.  This investigation is a national security necessity and we will fully investigate all the evidence we collect and follow that evidence wherever it leads to protect the country and meet the expectations of the American people. The investigation will focus on six key questions: 
 
•	What Russian cyber activity and other active measures were directed against the United States and its allies?
•	Did the Russian active measures include links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns or any other U.S. Persons?
•	What was the U.S. Government’s response to these Russian active measures and what do we need to do to protect ourselves and our allies in the future? 
•	What possible leaks of classified information took place related to the Intelligence Community Assessment of these matters?
 
On a bipartisan basis, my colleagues and I are aggressively continuing our oversight responsibilities as it relates to not only Russian involvement in the 2016 election, but also any contacts by any campaign individuals that might have occurred. There are questions that need to be answered and these questions will be answered as Congress continues its robust oversight of these issues and follows the evidence wherever it may lead. 
 
Thank you again for contacting me. As always, if you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact me or my Legislative Correspondent, Ike Crews, at 202.225.2231, or by email at Ike.Crews@mail.house.gov.

HAS the First Minister blinked? Is Nicola Sturgeon thinking twice about calling a second independence referendum later this month as widely trailed? Some believe her remarks to the David Hume Institute this week on devolution betray cold feet on independence.

Instead of repeating her call for Scotland to be allowed to remain in the single market after Brexit, or else she would call another referendum, Ms Sturgeon issued a dramatic warning that devolution is at risk, that powers exercised by the Scottish Parliament since 1999 are about to be stripped away by a right-wing clique of Brexit centralists. 

 The change of tone took some by surprise, including it seems, her deputy, John Swinney. He had some difficulty on BBC’s Good Morning Scotland specifying exactly which responsibilities were going to be removed from Holyrood, given that the UK Government White Paper last month promised that none would be. He suggested that Theresa May’s reluctance (so far) to specify any extra powers for Holyrood post-Brexit is effectively the same as powers removed. He also referred to the failure of the Supreme Court to agree that Westminster was, as he put it, “statutorially” required to recognise the Sewel Convention and not cut across Holyrood’s powers without its consent.

The First Minister hasn’t withdrawn her threat to call an independence referendum. It’s still very much in the air, even though Mrs May is indicating she won’t agree to one until after 2019. But at the very least, the focus has shifted from an independence referendum to defending devolution. Ms Sturgeon is clearly trying to put pressure on the PM to show her Brexit hand when she addresses the Scottish Tory conference this weekend. The Conservatives have all along said there will be a Brexit bonus for Holyrood; the First Minister is convinced this is bogus.

Since the June referendum, some have been saying that as soon as powers are removed from Brussels, and repatriated to the UK, then Holyrood’s powers will automatically be enhanced in areas already devolved, like agriculture and fisheries, family law and the environment. But this is based on a misunderstanding of devolution and Scotland’s relationship to the EU. 

 Holyrood – as the UK White Paper states – only exercises devolved powers so long as they accord with European Law. After Brexit, Holyrood will exercise powers over agriculture and fisheries as it does at the moment, but it will do so, not in accordance with Brussels law, but with UK law. This is a fundamental change and the reason why the First Minister is warning Brexit may diminish the powers of the Scottish Parliament.

The UK Government will insist that on “day one” after Brexit, nothing will actually change because the PM has said all repatriated laws are to remain the same for the time being. Brussels directives and regulations will be “cut and pasted” and instantly transformed into UK statutes. But clearly that is not going to continue indefinitely. It would be absurd for the UK to go to all the trouble of leaving the EU only to retain all of its laws intact. In future, UK laws will be changed as the UK Government sifts through all the EU directives and regulations. It may decide to allow things like hormone-treated beef, EU regulations on which currently prevent many US agricultural exports being sold in UK markets.

The UK could argue that this doesn’t actually alter Holyrood’s powers as such because they are the same as they were before Brexit – the only difference is that overall regulation is coming form Westminster rather than Brussels. And under the Scotland Act, isn’t Westminster ultimately sovereign in all instances? The UK could argue that Holyrood’s constitutional rights are unaffected and there is no more requirement for legislative consent (a Sewel motion) than there was over Article 50. The Scottish Government will dispute this interpretation, needless to say. 

 The material change to Holyrood is pretty obvious. If nothing else, Brexit ends the situation in which Scotland is in a sense the servant of two masters: Europe on the one hand, with its regulations and directives; and Westminster on the other which rules on reserved matters like defence, economy, welfare and so on. Now the powers are collapsed into Westminster, Scotland will be much more visibly a creature of Westminster. Moreover, Scottish agricultural subsidies are set and financed by the EU under the Common Agricultural Policy. All this will change.

The Tories are of course aware of all this, though they’ve tended to sideline the implications for devolution since the UK Supreme Court ruled in January that Holyrood had no veto power over Article 50. It was noticeable that, following the ruling, Theresa May and her ministers stopped talking about new powers. 

This weekend the PM will have to fill in the gaps. She’s being asked to give assurances she cannot deliver: namely that Holyrood’s powers will not in any sense be diminished by Brexit. She will try to argue that Holyrood’s powers are the same, indeed enhanced by a dusting of new powers in areas like the environment (as I explained earlier this week). But she cannot in all honesty say that nothing will change. 

 Who pays the piper plays the tune, and it is Westminster, not Holyrood, that will take future decisions on agricultural subsidies. According to the Financial Times nearly three-quarters of Scottish farmers’ incomes comes from such subsidies. The UK Government has only promised to keep this level of support until 2020, and Holyrood will not decide what replaces the CAP regime.

Nor can or will Scotland have control of regulatory issues like GM crops. If Westminster accepts forms of genetically modified agriculture currently outlawed by Europe, Scotland will have to comply, unless there is a specific exemption. And this is not just about agriculture – Westminster will assume nearly all the regulatory powers currently exercised by Brussels.

Ms Sturgeon has always made clear that she has been fighting Brexit on two fronts; trying to keep Scotland in the single market while ensuring that Scotland gets the best deal from Brexit. The two are not incompatible. This week she is trying to get voters’ heads around the complexities of Brexit, and dispel the notion that somehow, after A50, everything will remain the same. It won’t and it can’t. ",t5_2qkli,,dees249,t3_5x2hnf,

Thing is, take a look at this if you didn't already https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures

that money spent in new weapons technology and material will only have a good rate of investment if it's used against a super-power (like Russia, China) in next 10-20 years - I say against a super-power because F35 is a terrible investment for fighting an Iraq-style war, otherwise it's thrown away money that could have been used *to make America great again*. Couple this with the lessening economic gap against China and a clearly lost demographic struggle and the projections of American generals predicting the ""end of air superiority"" in 20 years and the way I see it is there are only 2 options:

1. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144550/ this kind of corruption on a stupendous, mind boggling/shattering level which should have heads be rolling
2. a superpower understanding that it's superpower status is slipping and determined to cash in the check via arms spending &amp; consequently war

The option 2) is what USSR had in front of itself in 1980s, the invasion of West Europe that didn't come because of the US line in the sand in the form of nuclear retaliation - MAD doctrine - hence my USSR reference. 

US today, like USSR back in the day, if indeed option 2) is what is going on, is getting armed for a conflict it will not be able to enter unless it wants to implement MAD with Russia and China. The Obama/Clinton era foreign policy was denial that MAD existed as a possibility, Putin's foreign policy was table fist-banging that MAD is indeed on - you'll find a bunch of fear mongering videos with Putin ""explaining to the journalists how US will end the world by provoking Russia to use nuclear weapons"".

They attacked their own cities like Constantinople. Made a crusader country tha only prevailed for like 10+ years or so and then just dissapeared.

Meer recentere voorbeelden zijn bevoorbeeld de CommonWealth fund in 2014  die Nederland [op de vijfde plaats](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/fund-report/2014/jun/1755_davis_mirror_mirror_2014.pdf) zet, een onderzoek gepubliceerd door Lancet (gefinancierd door de Bill&amp;Melinda Gates foundation) in 2015 die Nederland op de [achtse plaats](http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736\(16\)31467-2.pdf) zet, of het [Frasier Instituut in](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/comparing-performance-of-universal-health-care-countries-2016.pdf) 2016 waar we op de meeste categorieën ook niet hoger scoren dan de andere west/noord-europese landen.  
Veel van die onderzoeken nemen mentale healthcare ook niet mee, waarvan de beschikbaarheid in Nederland ook achteruit gegaan is afgelopen jaren.


Overigens is mijn stelling zeker wel dat we een goed gezondheidsstelsel hebben hoor.  En ik kan heel goed begrijpen dat je als minister van volkgsgezondheid constant het rapport aanhaalt waar wij het hoogste scoren, maar we moeten ons geen illusies maken en doen alsof wij het *echt* beter doen dan de rest van (met name west/noord) Europa.

Honestly, you should stay put in one city and take day-trips. If you stay in Munich, you've got Dachau, Nüremberg, Schloss Neuschwanstein and possibly downtown Augsburg and/or Ulm in reach. Consider taking the train. You will also want to visit the Englischer Garten in Munich. During the summer they have a great expo called Die Nackerten.

I mean, Spanish cinema is already getting its influences (Carlos Vermut's ""Magical Girl""), and I adore it.

The setting is so easily identifiable as 21st Century and European, and the actors play really theatrically and in a cold manner. It's, as you said, as if the bodies and gestures were more important than their individual faces, giving the whole film a surreal atmosphere.

And more importantly, and I think it's important to point out due to the nature of Southern European cinema, they're marvelously designed social commentaries on our culture and society. No aspect of it (sense of being fake, loniless, pretension of being richer than we are and the patriarchal nature of Europe) is left untouched. It's brilliant as both an art expression and medium to express political opinions.

Also, if you enjoyed Lanthimos' films, I recommend Avranas' ""Miss Violence"" (a bit harsher than those of Lanthimos) and Athina Tsarangi's ""Attenberg"" (which counts with Lanthimos participation on it).

Now it usually just happens when there's a lot of up/down movement (driving in cars through the Ozark mountains, for example,) or if I'm dehydrated/have eaten greasy or fatty food/am sore. 

First things first: prepare your body for a long flight. Workout and stretch for several days before, but don't be too strenuous--you'll end up sore and unable to get comfortable. Up your water intake-- the air in the plane is dry and zaps the water from your body, making you dehydrated (and malaised.) Eat nutrient-rich food before, during, and after your flight. Be sure it's low in sodium (dehydration,) and high in vitamins and minerals. Water-rich foods are a great way to ""trick"" you into getting more water. If possible, eat more melons and low-sodium soups. Bring a face mask in your carry on, and apply it upon boarding so as to soak moisture into your face (added bonus-- you'll look great and glowy!) I sneak cucumbers into my water infusing bottle, and place them over my eyes. Or you can use tea bags or a gel mask. 

I drink a sprite when it's offered on the flight (or stop at McDonalds if driving,) bring water with me (if you fill bottles up after security, you're golden. I'm bringing a fruit infusing bottle and a rollable bottle on my trip to Europe this summer,) be sure to eat fruit/veggies/carbs before and during (order a vegetarian meal so it's fresh and healthier. Or, if you're like me and taking a discount airline that makes you pay extra for food, granola bars, applesauce, and low-sodium trail mix are excellent options. I think I'm bringing nuts, hummus, applesauce, and pita chips this summer.) I also highly recommend doing yoga or general stretches before your flight, then throughout the journey if you're not sleeping (if you are sleeping, be sure to wear compression socks to reduce the risk of DVT! Sorry, I'm a health worker, and have also watched my mom survive a stroke and several heart attacks; I worry!) 

I also have a poor lower back due to the nature of my job and over a decade of dancing. In order to reduce that stiffness and pain, I roll up a sweater/bulky item I wore on (hello, /r/onebag!) and place it in the lower back region. It aligns the spine, and keeps me relatively comfortable.

In neither of two world wars was it the U.S intention to 'team up' with Russia. We were fighting the same enemy, but not for the same reasons, and certainly NOT to aid each other.

In WWI it was even more of separation than in WW2. In the first war, the US troops never even integrated into the allied forces. We cooperated, but maintained our own separate command and control; also, we never declared war against the other Central powers, only Germany.

The US did not even enter WWI militarily until it was nearly over. US troops began arriving in the spring of 1918, after the war had decisively turned against Germany. Germany surrendered in November of that year. US troops certainly helped accelerate the end, but the writing was already on the wall at that point. 

More importantly to your question: the Russians were out of the war in March of 1918, having signed a peace treaty. American troops had only started arriving in Europe by that time. So technically, Russia and the US did not fight together in WW I at all.

&gt;Bruno de Carvalho is outspoken, confrontational, unpredictable and abrasive. He is a hero to his supporters but is accused of demeaning his prestigious office by those who look down their noses at him. He is either a brash populist standing up for his people or an unseemly loudmouth with deep psychological issues, depending on who you believe.

&gt; **De Carvalho is the Donald Trump of Portuguese football, the president of Sporting Lisbon who is trying to make his club great again. On Saturday he is facing re-election and an opponent in Pedro Madeira Rodrigues determined to undo what De Carvalho has done in office.**

&gt; But De Carvalho is expected to win comfortably, giving him the licence to keep running the club the way he wants. It may not be popular with everyone but he can fairly point to the awful state of the club when he took over in March 2013, four years ago. Sporting had been run into the ground, were in hundreds of millions of euros of debt and had stopped competing on the pitch too. In 2012-13 they finished seventh, the worst season in their history.

&gt; De Carvalho believed that Sporting’s problems owed to their proximity to some of football’s most powerful agents, not least Jorge Mendes, and promised to drain the swamp. It is a brave man who tries to run a Portuguese football club without Mendes’ help but that is what De Carvalho has tried to do.

&gt; The president declared war on Mendes, making him persona non grata at Sporting, flatly refusing to deal with him. Mendes might say that he refused to deal with De Carvalho too. William Carvalho, the jewel in Sporting’s crown, could not sign a new deal until he split with Mendes, as he did in February 2016, and he is now represented by Pere Guardiola instead. Adrien Silva and Joao Mario, now of Inter, had to leave the Mendes stable too. “I did great business last summer without Mendes’ help,” De Carvalho boasted last November

&gt; De Carvalho has a noble goal of not wanting to see clubs walked over by big agents. Sporting have one of Europe’s finest academies and De Carvalho sees himself as a spokesman for the clubs who produce players rather than just buy them. He wants Uefa to do more to support and protect producing clubs, even if his own brand of diplomacy is not exactly geared towards making friends.

&gt; To reinvigorate the team on the pitch, in 2014 De Carvalho recruited a 36-year-old Marco Silva, who had just worked a miracle at Estoril, taking them from near-bankruptcy in the second tier up to the Europa League. Silva did very well at Sporting, taking them to the Portuguese Cup in 2014, their first trophy in seven years, but De Carvalho fell out with him. Those sympathetic to Silva said that De Carvalho was jealous of the new man’s popularity. De Carvalho thought that, for all the progress, Sporting could do better.

&gt; So De Carvalho agreed a secret deal with Jorge Jesus, coach of hated rivals Benfica, to cross Lisbon to coach Sporting instead, with a €6m salary offer, far more than Silva was paid. Jesus said yes and so days after winning the cup, Silva was sacked on the ludicrous grounds of failing to wear a club suit at official events. Benfica wanted Silva to replace Jesus, but De Carvalho put a clause in his severance pricing him out of working for another Portuguese club for the near future. Vasco Lourenco, former Sporting advisor, said that De Carvalho was a “psychiatric case” for sacking Silva, which made him ashamed of the club.

&gt; The appointment of Jesus was one of the most controversial moves in recent Portuguese football history. De Carvalho’s presidential rival, Rodrigues, has committed to replacing him with former Tottenham manager Juande Ramos in the unlikely event that he wins.


&gt; Jesus, it must be said, has not made Sporting great again quite yet. They are third in the Primeira Liga, 10 points behind leaders Benfica, having finished a close second last season. But De Carvalho is still a hero to the claques in the stands at the Estadio Jose Alvalade, not least because he acts like he is a fan who has found his way into the boardroom. He has even found his way down into the dugout at times this season, when he feels the need to make his presence felt.

&gt;At many places that would be over-stepping the mark but few men are as powerful or dominant in a big European club as De Carvalho is at Sporting. The blustering, arguing, constantly-vaping 45-year-old is certainly not to everyone’s taste, but he has imposed himself and his huge personality on the club in a way that few men manage to do. And he is not going anywhere soon.

Nope. I think you don't know how parliamentary immunities work.

The [""Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union""](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A12012E%2FPRO%2F07) provides for two types of immunities, under article 8 and 9, respectively.

Article 8 immunity protects MEPs against all charges relating to opinions expressed and votes cast in the performance of their duties. It cannot be waived.

Article 9 immunity protects MEPs against any and all prosecution **while the EP is in session**; the goal here is not to immunize them from prosecution, but to ensure that the functioning of the EP is not disrupted by (say) a member state deciding to arrest all communist MEPs prior to a critical vote. The EP will routinely waive this kind of immunity in response to any genuine request by law enforcement, as the purpose is not to protect the MEP, but the proper functioning of the EP.

They do not decide whether she is to be prosecuted, but only check whether the request for prosecution is genuine and in accordance with the laws of the member state making that request; the EP isn't a court and doesn't have the expertise or procedures to rule on innocence or guilt.",t5_2qh4j,UNSA,deev9bk,t3_5x2l6s,

Languages are different. For example, In Chinese/Japanese they don't have seperate numbers for eleven, twelve, thirteen, etc. eleven is one-one, twelve is one-two, which is slightly easier to process and can award a higher score on IQ tests. In some African languages, there are only two words for numbers ""One"", and ""Many"".
