your system ends up with a lot of (if not mostly, depending on pool) in-region matches, which is a **huge waste of time**. the whole point of the individualized region games (LCS NA, LCS EU, LCK, LMS, etc) is to determine which teams in their respective regions are the best among them. we already did that; we don't need to do it again and waste time in group stages.

False,"In France all universities are supposed to offer more or less the same courses with the same level. Generally people just go the University that is the closest, except if they want to study something very specific that is not proposed by their local university. Universities cannot practice selection at bachelor level, except for dual-bachelors and some specific diplomas. 

Now, in practice, all universities are not on the same level, at least in some specific fields. If the level and kind of licences (bachelors) they propose is very often the same, they do distinct themselves when it comes to masters degree as some are very demanded and very selective (in specific domains of law for example). So for example, a student may do his licence (bachelor) of law at the University of Bordeaux and then try to get a place in a selective master in universities like Paris II Panthéon-Assas and Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne that are quite reputed in law. 

There's also the question of research, some universities tend to attract the best academics and are better ranked internationally. (UPMC in hard sciences, Paris I and Paris IV in History for example). Now rankings are inconsistant, Paris I ranks very well in QS rankings, while in the Shanghai ranking the University of Paris-Sud or the University of Strasbourg (very good in biosciences) do better. 

But on a national level we do not rank our universities like American or British do, there might be some newspapers that ranks masters in specific domains (like which universities offer the best masters in finance or law) but rankings and fight for prestige is really something that concerns the Grandes Écoles, which are smaller schools that are very selective. Grandes écoles include business schools, engineering schools, institute of political sciences, the 4 ENS (écoles normale supérieure, they form the best professors) and some other schools in specific domains.

Business schools put a lot of efforts to be the best ranked and more reputed. The best Business School has consistently been HEC (and it has also been the best or second best in Europe for years). The best Engineering School is Polytechnique. And the best in research in humanities, social sciences and hard science is the École Normale Supérieure (especially the one in Paris). I'd say that the ENS is the more prestigious school : entrance exams are insane and the school have produced lots of Fields Medal recipients (all French recipients but one) and very reputed philosophers and historians.

False,"David Cameron has scrapped demands for full British exclusion from EU employment laws ahead of his planned Brexit referendum, in a move that could help keep trade unions and Jeremy Corbyn, the leftwing Labour leadership candidate, in the Yes camp.


The prime minister was reported in July to be fighting to exclude Britain from the full range of EU employment and social laws, but instead he is pushing for more limited protection for the UK’s flexible labour market.

Cameron walks tightrope ahead of EU talks
Migrants on agenda in Cameron’s EU quest
Osborne wins Nordic backing for EU reform

The prime minister, who will travel to Spain and Portugal this week for talks on his renegotiation, was advised that France and the European parliament would strongly oppose exempting British employers from EU labour rules.

Mr Cameron’s softly-softly approach will irritate some Tory eurosceptics. Steve Baker, the Tory MP and leader of the Conservatives for Britain group, said it was “increasingly clear that EU membership is not compatible with either parliamentary control of domestic law or our borders”.

But Mr Cameron’s stance may help maintain a broad cross-party coalition for a Yes vote in his referendum on Britain’s EU membership, including keeping on board the organisational muscle of trade unions.
Next month’s Trades Union Congress will become the focus for a row on the left over Britain’s place in Europe with several unions arguing for Brexit if Mr Cameron waters down workers’ rights.

The RMT rail union is understood to be preparing to unveil a new bloc of unions in favour of the UK leaving the EU on the eve of the annual trade union event in Brighton in early September.

But GMB, one of the largest unions, will at Congress recommend a “No” vote in the referendum if the government undermines workers’ rights in its imminent renegotiation.

Meanwhile Mr Corbyn, frontrunner in the Labour leadership contest, said in July he did not exclude campaigning for Brexit, because Mr Cameron favoured “trading away workers’ rights” and weaker environmental protection. He subsequently said he would fight to reform the EU from within.

Former Conservative prime minister John Major secured an “opt-out” from the EU social chapter in 1993 — covering employment and social laws — but that opt-out was abandoned by former Labour premier Tony Blair in 1998.

Although Mr Cameron wants a more flexible EU economy, his allies say he is not trying to turn back the clock. “We aren’t trying to get the full opt-out back,” said one member of the Cameron team. Downing Street declined to comment.

Instead British negotiators are focusing on ensuring that the EU working-time directive — the most vexatious law for some British employers — does not inflict harm on the economy.

The directive, which sets a 48-hour maximum working week, is not part of the social chapter because it is officially a “health and safety” measure. It is mitigated in Britain because workers can individually opt-out of the rules.

The individual opt-out is permanently under review in Brussels and Mr Cameron sympathises with those — including the CBI employers’ federation — who want it to be made permanent.",cumgp1c,t3_3j5jrp,from the sublime to the ridiculous,0,t3_3j5jrp,t5_2qhcv,0,1443913975,1,1,,,ukpolitics,Anyales,1441066585

se o contacto com o jogador for anterior ao contacto com a bola naturalmente que é falta

correndo o risco de lesionar o seu adversário. O jogador que atue com força excessiva deve ser expulso.*

False,"A primeira coisa é aprender a fazer um bom arroz. Nem toda a gente se safa a fazer arroz e é um ingrediente que quando bem feito muda totalmente o sabor do teu prato.

Para fazer o arroz seco que é um dos que eu mais curto e um dos mais usados na cozinha portuguesa prefiro usar o arroz carolino, pode ser feito com cebola ou alho. Eu faço com alho e consigo ter arroz pronto em menos de 15 minutos, é simples:

* Meter um pouco de óleo (umas 3 colheres de sopa) a ferver no tacho, sem queimar o óleo.
* Adicionar 1 chávena de arroz
* Deixar o arroz fritar um pouco, mas nunca até queimar
* Adicionar 1,5 chávenas de água
* Sem descascar, esmagar dois ou mais dentes de alho com a palma das mãos (não precisas de picar o alho e ao esmagar é muito mais fácil descascar)
* Adicionar o alho ao arroz
* Podes por também uma folha de louro para dar mais sabor
* Adicionar sal
* Esperar que a água ferva
* Tapar o tacho
* Passar para a boca mais pequena do fogão
* Por o fogo no mínimo
* Esperar que a água seque toda

A ideia aqui é deixar o arroz absorver o vapor da água, podes ter um fogo baixo e consegues manter a água em vapor.

Uma outra base muito usada é a massa. Fazer a massa não tem nada de difícil: Metes a água a ferver com um pouco de sal, atiras a massa que quiseres lá para dentro e deixas que ela coza (podes verificar com um garfo para saber se ela está cozida). No fim escorres e só no fim é que metes o azeite para ela não colar. Meter o azeite durante a cozedura não faz sentido nenhum. O molho é sempre posto depois da massa estar cozida e escorrida. Se o teu molho já tiver azeite ou outro óleo, não vale a pena meter nada para ela não colar.

Outro truque fixe é nunca usar gorduras como o azeite para frituras porque o azeite não aguenta muito bem com o calor, dá preferência ao óleo vegetal ou mesmo à banha. Dizem que é mais saudável porque os bi-produtos da queima dos óleos pode ser cancerígena. A banha aguenta com temperaturas muito altas, o óleo vegetal com temperaturas altas e o azeite não aguenta muito bem com as temperaturas. A manteiga também não aguenta com temperaturas muito altas e começa a ficar escura rapidamente.

Os temperos são importantes e dão sempre um toque especial na tua comida. Os meus temperos preferidos são a pimenta preta e os cominhos. A pimenta preta fica boa com quase tudo, os cominhos já não são para toda a gente mas eu meto até nos ovos.

Se queres aprender pratos portugueses, podes procurar receitas na net mas é difícil de encontrar uma boa receita para um determinado prato. Muitas receitas não são específicas e ficas sem saber qual é a quantidade que deves meter dos ingredientes e se não tens muito traquejo na culinária, torna-se difícil. Eu costumo ignorar essas receitas e procuro as mais exactas, para mim a culinária é como operar um laboratório e tento usar quantidades exactas para tentar encontrar padrões nas receitas.

Se tiveres a oportunidade, pede a tua mãe para te explicar como é que ela faz a feijoada dela e tenta replicar, depois de conseguires fazer igual, compara a outras feijoadas que vires na internet e começa a tentar modificar a receita da tua mãe e tenta fazer uma feijoada ainda melhor.

É fácil fazer bons pratos com muito dinheiro mas fazer bons pratos todos os dias é fodido se não ganhas bem. Cozinhar bem e barato é difícil mas dá jeito aprender.

1441071900,"American PhDs still require more coursework on top of an MA. If you enter a PhD program with an MA you are required to do 2 additional years of PhD coursework plus comprehensive exams in multiple subject areas depending on your specific major. If you enter a PhD program in the US directly after your BA and get your MA and PhD together, you typically do two years of coursework credited toward your MA, complete some sort of thesis or multiple paper + exams option to finish the MA portion, then have one additional year of PhD coursework (or even two or three years depending on specific subject areas and institutions) and then a round of PhD comprehensive exams. After those exams you qualify as ABD status (all but dissertation), which is a formally accepted status that you are qualified to teach at universities in your subject areas but have not yet received the title of full PhD. It's that last portion of course and exam requirements that is absent at many non-American institutions and is the aspect I was referring to that American hiring committees could see as a weakness if you don't have it.

edit: I don't mean to imply that American PhDs are inherently better. There are just different systems. Until very recently in Germany, for example, a humanities student typically only had two degree options, an MA (Magister, not Masters) and a doctorate. The Magister involved 6-7 years of coursework plus a thesis larger than a typical US Masters plus something similar to US PhD qualifying exams. So by the time you began a doctorate in Germany you would have had roughly the equivalent studies of an American PhD student, because US undergrads typically spend the first 1.5 years taking general knowledge courses in a wide field of non-major courses that European students already had in high school.

Armenia is basically the line between ""white""  Eastern Europe and the ""brown"" South Asia, and as such, there are a lot of different skin variations there.

If Rollins is to be considered not-White at all, he would likely be considered Hispanic or Latino, considering his father was Mexican-American and his last name is Lopez.  But honestly, even that's a stretch outside of how he, personally, identifies.

Regardless, he absolutely ""looks"" white, and that's really what matters when you are considering how people react to him.  Or, in other words, if Zahra was a huge racist and would only date white people, she would likely still date Rollins.  Maybe she'd break up with him when she learned that he's got some Mexican or Armenian in him, but it wouldn't be a situation where she would outright avoid him on a racial basis.

He's given the provinces carte blanche to introduce more private elements a la European models in health care; cut the CBC to the point where shutting down the television portion would be viewed more as an act of mercy than ideology; laid the groundwork for the end of supply management under the TPP, weakened the various chorus of leftwing voices pleading for taxpayer funding in the art, academia, and charity worlds.

If the US shrinks the DoD budget, they shrink their power projection capabilities and in turn that means their ability to act as ""world police"".    

As the US shrinks their military and military capabilities they'll also shrink their ""global responsibilities"" as a result meaning someone out there is going to have to pick up the tab and fill in the shoes as it were.    

This would mean one or two things, those with the budget will have to increase *their* military spending to defend their interests, trade routes, oil import/export that sort of thing. If the US withdraws from it's current role the other possibility is someone else will fill it rather than having it equally divided, so with that who would be the ""prefered"" de facto superpower the US, Russia or China.    

If one thinks about it the US military and it's budget is disproportionately large, and for example Europe's is disproportionately small.

False,"If you didn't know, as a group, Swedish doctors oppose nontherapeutic child circumcision. Circumcision was big news in Sweden about 15 years ago after a boy died of a ritual circumcision. [This law](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1572483.stm) was passed in 2001 as a result. 

More recently, numerous medical authorities and organizations have issued statements condemning non-therapeutic/infant circumcision. For instance, representing Danish, Estonian, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish clinical sexologists, in 2013 the [Nordic Association of Clinical Sexology](http://www.nacs.eu/data/press_release001.pdf) stated:

 &gt; The penile foreskin is a natural and integral part of the normal male genitalia. The foreskin has a number of important protective and sexual functions. It protects the penile glans against trauma and contributes to the natural functioning of the penis during sexual activity. …during sexual activity the foreskin is a functional and highly sensitive, erogenous structure, capable of providing pleasure to its owner and his potential partners.  
As clinical sexologists, we are concerned about the human rights aspects associated with the practice of non-therapeutic circumcision of young boys. To cut off the penile foreskin in a boy with normal, healthy genitalia deprives him of his right to grow up and make his own informed decision. Unless there are compelling medical reasons to operate before a boy reaches an age and a level of maturity at which he is capable of providing informed consent, the decision to alter the appearance, sensitivity and functionality of the penis should be left to its owner, thus upholding his fundamental rights to protection and bodily integrity.  
Every person's right to bodily integrity goes hand in hand with his or her sexual autonomy.

The [Swedish Pediatric Society](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2012/02/19/Swedish-doctors-urge-ban-on-circumcision/UPI-61961329678560/) called for requiring non-therapeutic circumcision to be voluntary. The [Swedish Children's Ombudsman, Swedish Society of Medicine (SLS), the Swedish Society of Health Professionals (Vårdförbundet), the Swedish Paediatric Society (BLF) and the Swedish Association of Pediatric Surgeons (SLF)](http://www.thelocal.se/20130928/50496) agree:

 &gt; There is no medical reason to circumcise little boys; the procedure is painful, irreversible and can cause complications, according to Sweden's children's ombudsman and representatives for several healthcare organizations.  
The ombudsman Fredrik Malmberg, together with representatives from the Swedish Society of Medicine (SLS), the Swedish Society of Health Professionals (Vårdförbundet), the Swedish Paediatric Society (BLF) and the Swedish Association of Pediatric Surgeons (SLF), argues that Swedish law requires that the child's will be taken into account wherever possible. Circumcision is a procedure which is typically carried out at a very young age and it is this issue of consent which is paramount, they argue. ""We consider circumcision of boys without the child's consent to be in contravention of article 12 of UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) which gives children the right to have an opinion in matters which concern them."" They furthermore argue for a change in Swedish legislation in order to meet the human rights of the child and medical ethics.

I don't get how folks have a 'golden era' of the 60s and always harken back to it. Wages as part of gdp were the same, the effective tax rate against the top 20% was the same, and our spending on infrastructure was actually less than it is today as a percentage of budget.

He didnt get us to the superbowl, nor the playoffs. He gave us hope. He did it because he was the blue collar representation that of the Bills. He worked from the ground to here and never let up. Coe college, Nfl Europe, Arena Football. To be the most beloved Bill ever. 

He has shown, despite how shitty we've been, we always had something, someone to root for. Despite what anyone thinks, Fred Jackson kept the Bills alive in heart and spirit. He should always be remembered. Not because he set records or was the best player ever on the Bills roster. But because he was the best person on the Bills roster.

In the US people are uncomfortable even talking about race, too easy to have something taken the wrong way and to be labeled a racist. In Europe racial problems are addressed more directly instead of desperately hidden. 

In the USA if somebody is arrested, murdered, or otherwise makes the news or national headlines, their race is always reported. It's like it's not a news story if they don't state the colors of everyone involved.

Really wasn't my intention to send you on a massive research hunt, but I love the Internet...

Laws surrounding public photography can be _extremely_ vague - just to be clear, I was referring to this in terms of international trends, not what you get in ""limited"" public spaces (e.g. public transportation, which is what we started out with).  The harassment I was referring to, in turn, was with regards to the implementation of laws banning photography as a prevention of terrorism measure; again, in terms of international trends.  It's absolutely arbitrary and vague in many jurisdictions.

I've got some reading to do about Australian rules - always a good idea to bone up on the laws of the country you're moving to.  But for comparison, just to illustrate my point:

- in Germany everyone has the right to their own image.  You can get in trouble for photographing someone without permission, except where that image is incidental to a wider scene.  Many people do not understand how this works, and will become angry when, for example, you photograph a flea market stand (no persons involved) because they believe photography of any private property to be against the law - happened to a friend of mine last Sunday!
- France is somewhat more liberal; rules focus mainly on images of individuals and publication thereof
- Generally most European cities require some form of permit when you photograph in enclosed public spaces (train stations, etc.) with a tripod.  Laws or rules about this vary.  ""Don't be a dick"" tends to apply.  Technically, cities own the ""image"" of many icons (e.g. Eiffel Tower) and you're supposed to have a license to publish photos of it professionally, although this is rarely enforced.  There's a massive kerfuffle about a proposed rule that could [limit the freedom of panorama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_panorama)
- The UK yet again is more liberal on the whole, but many police departments do not themselves understand aspects of photography law; for example, the [national police chief's organization](http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/photo-news/police-terror-photography-u-turn-acpo-letter-revealed-in-full-21937) had to provide guidance on a rule about photographing police after public fallout from several photographers being harassed for various reasons
- US rules seem to be a hot mess - generally much more liberal yet again than the UK's, areas of confusion between states range from photographing police and one-vs-two-party-consent (not generally applicable for photography) to the interpretation of the idea of ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" and rights of property owners - a good example being the repeated harassment by security guards of people photographing [this San Francisco landmark building](http://boingboing.net/2009/10/23/555-california-secur.html).  

Most of the confused implementation of supposed terrorism-based restrictions on photography I'm aware of have been in the UK and US ([Bruce Schneier has some good examples](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/06/the_war_on_phot.html).  There are plenty of instances of someone being harassed for taking photos of something from public land for vague reasons of ""it's against terrorism"" - with no underlying legal justification.

If you search for ""photographers rights cards"", numerous photo organizations, lawyers, and others issue cards clearly explaining their particular jurisdiction's laws around photography.

Again, I was not specifically referring to Australia, nor to public transportation, although your research is appreciated.  Now I want _my_ time spent writing this post back :D

False,"Here's the dirty little secret about promotion/relegation in Europe: it's an illusion. A smokescreen. You think teams move up and down in Europe due to good coaching and player development? Please. Unless you're a yo-yo club, a big club that goes belly-up or a small club that gets an angel investment from someone with nothing better to do with his money, there is very little promoting and relegating in European soccer. The clubs find the levels they're best suited for and that's where they stay. TSG Hoffenheim didn't earn their way into the Bundesliga with good coaching. They bought their way in, just as NYCFC bought their way into MLS. Leeds United didn't get relegated because their academy wasn't generating any talent. They got relegated because their owners financially ruined the team, just like Chivas USA's owners did.

If you're a good player on a lower level team, you don't stick around and help that team get promoted. You get bought by a premier level team. If you're a bad player on a top level team, you don't drag the team down and potentially get them relegated. You get loaned out or outright sold to a lower level team. The only people in Europe that truly get promoted and relegated on a large scale are players, not teams. Sounds an awful lot like a minor-league system. The difference is that the pro/rel system holds the lure of a big payday for lower level clubs who buy their way into the premier division and the specter of financial death for teams in the top division who don't spend enough money to stay in the top. The result is all the clubs spending themselves into bankruptcy unless there's some kind of strict centralized financial control a la the Bundesliga. That's the kind of system for which you are advocating. One that until FFP was introduced was leading European soccer to a financial abyss.

False,"Yes, with the exception of Germany, Europe's lower divisions are designed for player development - STARTING AT D3.  Not D2.  That is a competitive league.

Look, I hate the Cosmos from a competitive standpoint, but you keep trying to say that they're now responsible for destroying the NASL because they somehow threw a monkey wrench into this utopian society that MLS was magnanimously trying to build out of the goodness of their own hearts.

What MLS and USL are building is basically the MLS reserves under a different name and marketing plan.  It's parasitically taken over a floundering league in USL, and the host is just the shell by which it operates.  Without the parasite, the host dies.  It's not a symbiotic relationship at all.

You're saying that the NASL wants to break tradition and do something different.  So what?  Is that bad for soccer?  Well, it's bad for MLS and USL, but not for the game.  

I love how you anoint MLS as the savior of soccer in the US, when the truth is that were they not bolstered by several billionaires trying to maintain a monopoly for the long game, they would have folded by now.

False,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication

Stone and pounds are colloquial in the UK, but grams is the standardized unit of measurement - just like in most of the rest of the world. You're right about the quirk with road signs being in miles, but again, the standardized units of measurement are in meters.

The UK metricated fairly late compared to the rest of Europe, and there was quite a bit of opposition to it. It's a pretty lengthy story with its own [lengthy Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_the_United_Kingdom).

The U.S. is the only major country and one of three countries worldwide that hasn't metricated. While the U.K. has some areas of measurement that don't use metric, whether through exemption or colloquy, the country itself uses the metric system as a standard.

Just like the rest of the developed world. Which is why the U.S. gets ragged on for its continued use of Imperial measurements.",cummxc1,t3_3j6608,,0,t3_3j6608,t5_2w844,0,1444101957,6,6,,,NoStupidQuestions,Repatriation,1441077015

1441137261,"Tanks which are keeping them in a war-torn third world, yeah.

White people used Christianity as an excuse to murder supposed witches, declare war on peoples of other religions, and eventually to enslave Africans. Should we blame Christianity? Or should we blame the backwards, racist, anti-intellectual, war-obsessed culture that the religion was molded to accommodate?

For a long time, the Middle East was ages ahead of Europe as far as civil rights, equality, and math, science, and other intellectual pursuits go. All while Europe was murdering itself in the name of Christianity. Eventually, the Western Christian world modernized, developed modern political institutions. The Middle East, despite showing hope for a while in the 60s, has spent the last hundred years subjugated by Western influences which installed and propagated secular dictators who inflamed sectarianism, created the Mujahideen, and has instigated and armed various militant groups over the past few decades. The Middle East has been absolutely destroyed, and generations of people who have endured constant violence have developed what we now see existing.

But hey, what was once the most forward-thinking religion in the world is to blame for this small section of the world's violent tendencies because clearly none of the above could be.

False,"I have heard, but don't know how true/accurate it is, that in Europe the age of adulthood used to be 13, which seemed an obvious transition point. However, it was pretty quickly discovered that 13 year old boys weren't developed enough physically to bear weapons and armor on the battlefield which was the main point of being an adult male at the time, to fight for your king if necessary. For that reason the age of adulthood was raised to 18 at which point most males are entering into their peak physical prime and were well suited for combat.

False,"Maybe you didn't understand what I was saying. I was arguing that this ""worldview"" is completely flawed. It's irrelevant as to how the Israelis view the conflict (as I am well aware), if in fact the narrative is inaccurate. Every government that ever existed found its own justifications. The only sound reasoning you gave to defend this narrative is that ""well this is how they view it."" Next, you didn't even attempt to justify the reasoning behind this narrative and completely ignored my response.

Of course every country  considers their own interests as more important, but I think there is something you're not comprehending. Simply claiming that you're preferring your interests over the interests of others does not make your interests correct. *Israel's entire narrative is completely revolved around her interests and as such doesn't evaluate the situation properly.* Take for example the settlements. In Israel's distorted worldview, they are legitimate. Though every other state, including the Untied States has stipulated on their illegitimacy, or illegality. There are several other parts of Israel's narrative that are only proclaimed by her. It is nothing more than propaganda used to legitimize otherwise illegal, discriminatory, violent, or unjust policies. 

Perhaps the easiest way to view the conflict is to take a step back and ask ourselves *what is the nature of the conflict?* History is important. The conflict didn't start with the 1948 war, the Suez crisis in 1956, nor did it start with the occupation. The conflict started about a century ago with complex, unresolved problems imposed on the region by imperialist French and British powers; carving up the Ottoman Empire and creating nation-states for their own interests. So essentially the conflict became a Zionist project in colonizing the land (""Jewish as England is English""), against the wishes of those already living there. Claiming that Israel is a settler-state is a simple fact. In which case, very few would argue that a settler state is morally acceptable, although most of those who argue that contradict themselves since they only apply it to this specific case for political reasons. Though even if that's the case, we must recognize the Zionist project is probably the very last colonization movement to get off the ground as it occurred during the end of the colonial period. Today colonization and colonialism are recognized as crimes against humanity. This is obvious through the decolonization doctrine among other moral values that are held in the 21st century. 

You also claim that you had ""*one factual error*"", but let's see if that's even true. I didn't even bother going over the inaccuracy in your statements. 

&gt;Israelis don't see the occupied territories as being ""Palestine"". 

This argument is completely flawed and illogical. First it is an unfounded opinion that only Israel truly believes. Nobody - not even the United States - considers the occupied Palestinian territories to not be Palestinian, nonetheless they nobody considered it to be Israeli. This is a distorted worldview that only Israel holds. 

Next, it also assumes that an ultranationalist settler-colonialist movement somehow has more rights to a territory than those already living there; in the 21st century nonetheless. 

Furthermore, the modern nation-state system that exists today in the Middle East was imposed only in the 20th century due to French/British interests. Practically every single state that exists in the Middle East today didn't exist until sometime in the 20th century. Does that mean the Zionist goals could have equally been applied to Iraq, Yemen, Transjordan or Egypt? After all, those mandates didn't have independence either. Technically the only reason Transjordan was not included to any ""Jewish homeland"" is due to the interests of imperial Britain. Basically your argument rests on imperialism, applying European type thinking to the Middle East, and claim laid out by a settler-colonialism.

These are just some of the flaws in that argument.

&gt;that the idea of a Palestine is more of a reaction against the idea of Israel and Jordan than anything else

This is disturbing reasoning as to why Palestinian nationalism should be suppressed. It does not matter if Palestinian nationalism came in response to Zionist goals. Moreover we must remember that the British did initially promise the Arabs in Palestine independence, and then even violated their own covenant (in which Britain and the League of Nations defined). The principle of Article 22 wasn't applied to Palestine. 

&gt;when Jordan controlled that land, when the world didn't necessarily call it ""occupied territories"", 

You're wrong again. The world did consider Jordan's as an occupying power. This is further proven by the fact that almost every country refused to recognize Jordan's annexation of the West Bank (only 2 or 3 countries recognized the annexation). 

&gt;and in fact maintained that they wanted their land back with no intention of creating an independent Palestine into the early 1990's

As already previously mentioned, Jordan had relinquished its claim to the territory in 1988.

&gt;They captured the land in a fundamentally defensive war that was instigated by their adversaries.

I'd only agree with this if it hadn't been Israel consistently violating the armistice agreements, encroaching on demilitarized zone, particularly in Syria; in which Israel went as far to not communicate with the commission, expelled Syrians living in the zone, and even started to build in it. Not to mention Israel had attacked Syria the month prior to the 1967 war, attacked all the way into Damascus, and had even attacked Jordan the year prior.

Let's not forget the developments that lead to what happened in 1967. Israel's policies pretty much lead to it. In fact it was Israel's consistent violations with Syria that finally lead Nasser to create a defense pact with Syria (otherwise he would have looked weak amongst the Arab world). Besides that Israel had even refused to ever allow the peace keeping forces on her side of the border with Egypt in 1967, or any year prior.

Furthermore, Israel in 1967 attacked first. Israel was not responding to an attack on her territory which by definition isn't an act of self-defense. 

&gt;Some of the land, especially the hill region, is of high strategic military and natural resource value (water). Some of the land, especially Jerusalem, is of high cultural value (and Jerusalem was a majority Jewish city before Zionism, until it was 'ethnically cleansed' of jews by the arabs in 1948).

Just because Israel wants to be a thief and exploit resources, and steal land doesn't a mean it is a sound reason. The entire world already rejected this reasoning. Israel is an occupying power and as such is not allowed to annex any part of the territory.

Your argument becomes even more ridiculous when you mention that Israel wants to keep Jerusalem because prior to 1948 the city had a Jewish majority. Though by that logic you ignore that the entirety of Palestine was majority Palestinian prior to the ethnic cleansing that took place in 1948. I think it's needless to say that the argument is extremely contradictory.

&gt;replaced by Hamas or other similar groups, or even ISIS or Al Queda, attacking them.

So what about before 1987? You're just cooking up any excuse now.

&gt;You wonder why israelis ""aren't obsessing over how terrible, hateful, and cruel they are"". 

Never said that. All I said is that there is a complete absence of any talk about Israel's violence or even the occupation in the /r/Israel sub.

False,"This is all fantastic advice. I could not agree more. I have a few anecdotes that might make further good examples (I hope?). Sorry this is super long winded.

TL;DR: don't act like an ungrateful dick; do be supportive of your friends and respectful when discussing anything that could be related to money.

My former best friend, ""Amy,"" grew up poor but became somewhat well off in her teens. Not exactly super wealthy, but enough that she no longer had to worry about university expenses at a fantastic school, living expenses, grad school, and was able to travel freely. It was nothing she personally earned, though she found ways to lie or warp that pretty significantly to the point where I think she almost believed it.

A lot of people went from absolutely thrilled for her great luck to seriously annoyed. Instead of just talking about things, she was constantly bragging. She knew my financial situation (broke and barely eating) but would not stop pestering me to do shit like go meet up with her in Europe and gave me this ""you're only young once!"" bullshit like I wouldn't have done anything to be able to afford travel. She always wanted to do expensive things and then nagged and pouted when friends politely said X activity was too expensive for them but she never, ever offered to pay. One time, I had just gotten out of a long hospital stay with shitloads of medical bills on top of already being broke and in debt, and she wanted to do some activity and I told her I absolutely couldn't afford it. Her response was, ""I'll buy your ticket if you buy mine! lol!"" uhhhh

It really took the cake when Amy, my other best friend, and myself were driving somewhere together and my other friend mentioned she and her husband had been eating ramen for weeks because they couldn't afford groceries. I told her how sorry I was, that I didn't know, and offered to help. Amy piped in and in complete earnest said, ""ugh, I know *exactly* what you mean! I'm broke as fuck right now after buying plane tickets to Germany for spring break."" I think it took hours for my jaw to leave the ground. She was constantly referring to herself as a broke college student and it was awful.

OP, I highly doubt you're like this at all. You sound super sensitive. The main lesson I'd take from my whiny ass rant about Amy (sometimes I just have to vent about this person) is try not to be pushy and don't downplay your situation so much you end up pissing people off. You're not a broke college student, which is great! You have a safety net that is wonderful and that your other friends already know about, so don't downplay it like it's not there. It sounds really ungrateful and weird to commiserate with people who legitimately don't have that safety net. I'm definitely not saying you do this. You sound pretty awesome and thoughtful--just something to be considerate of.

I have another friend, Mary, who comes from a fairly wealthy background. Her parents have always taken care of everything. Even in her early 30's, she's able to work a low paying artistic part time job because her parents continue to finance her life. She has suggested slightly too expensive activities in the past but more like slightly too expensive restaurant as opposed to European trip. She is great about suggesting lower cost activities if someone can't afford something, or she'll privately offer to pay for whatever it is within reason. Nothing super extravagant but in the past she's pulled me aside and told me that she wanted my company, she wanted to do X thing, and she'd be more than happy to help cover me so we could go together.

I am *not* saying you have to pay for shit for your friends. In fact, I only took Mary up on this once and took her out another time. I am saying it's so awesome having a friend who's willing to suggest other options and not pout about it when people can't afford things. She never brags, she's polite about how she discusses things like trips her parents paid for, she never pretends she's broke or entitled to anything, and she's down to just hang out at home or do cheaper activities.

I'm in a better place financially now. I'm not rich but I'm not broke by any stretch, and both Amy and Mary have taught me a *lot* about how to act around friends who have less than me. It's a struggle being broke and it can be hard not comparing yourself but ultimately you should not feel guilty for what you have. It's pretty great that you have that support! It's just about respecting and recognizing where other people come from.",cumpczd,t3_3j5qx7,,0,t1_cumioth,t5_2qjvn,0,1444103105,2,2,,,relationships,mortualuna,1441081791

Most of the stainless alloys used in jewelry/timepieces today don't contain any nickel or at least not enough to cause irritation to sensitive individuals. I think this is primarily thanks to Europe, where they enacted some laws: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_Directive

Basically, any watch being sold by a major company in Europe will likely have the same low-nickel or nickel-free stainless alloys in the US as well. They aren't likely to make two separate production lines just so they can use nickel in a US model watch. 

I don't currently own a Timex, although I had a stainless-backed Timex when I was growing up and never had any issues with it. Currently I wear a stainless Seiko 5 on a daily basis, no problems with that either.

I find it funny people complain it doesn't tackle racism when the resentment of other magical races and the fear of the Witchers is doing just that.

 Heck going by them trying to stay somewhat authentic to the world of the Novels then there are POC it's just they generally don't set foot outside their foreign kingdoms into the lands in most of the Witcher stories.

False,"Problemet, som jag ser det, när man efterlyser ""konkreta besked"" är att man öppnar för politisk teater. Där man lovar saker som egentligen inte går att lova: tiggarfrågan är en sån frågeställning. Det är jättelätt att tycka att det ska vara olagligt att tigga, och driva det som PR-politik, men egentligen handlar det om en komplicerad dominobricke-politik via EU. 

Som Sverige vill vara med i pga öppna gränser, och därför tillåter att tiggare finns. Vill vi förändra långsiktigt, genom att exempelvis få bort fattigdom (som skapar tiggare) måste det också ske via EU. Och då måste intresse för det skapas i alla stater. Och ""få bort fattigdom"" låter ju genast mycket flummigare, även om nog de flesta är införstådda med att det finns och behöver tacklas.

Konkreta besked är bra om man snackar om tydlighet. Att politiker är tydliga, och varför inte pedagogiska. Men det kräver såklart att människor är mottagliga för det.

Socialized medicine, caps on college tuition, generous welfare benefits, lower income inequality... they're not that much like us.

&gt;Sweden has a huge long-term debt problem, as they have large unfunded liabilities as a result of their social programs. Norway does too, but can scrape by a bit longer due to its natural resources.

The US has a much bigger debt problem. Our debt-to-GDP ratio is higher than both Norway and Sweden combined. Between wars and corporate welfare, we've had to borrow a lot.    

&gt;Gee, that's genetic. Maybe social democrats can change our genetics!!!

Actually it's a pretty basic tenet of psychology and neuroscience that mental illness is part nature (genetics) and part nurture (how and where you were raised). Growing up in poverty, having neglectful parents, being physically or sexually abused, these things all increase the risk for mental illness. Poverty levels, for one, are very high in the US. But of course that's only one out of many factors. Still, one in four Americans will suffer from a mental illness in their lifetime. This is much higher than any other industrialized nation.

&gt;That's not even true. The US pioneered most neonatal care innovations.

[Sadly it is true](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2014/09/29/our-infant-mortality-rate-is-a-national-embarrassment/). We rank 55th in the world in lowest infant mortality rate. Dead last out of the 27 wealthy nations.

We are just as bad off, if not worse than, most social democracies when it comes to debt and youth unemployment.

False,"To elaborate a little, this fits because Skellige is not exclusively a representation of medieval Scandinavian Europe. It is inclusive of that (heavy) influence, but it can also be taken as a representation of closely related cultures; think of Anglo-Saxon England and some pieces fall into place as well. 

This is partly to do with The Witcher's anachronisms as well. It doesn't present a time coherent representation of medieval European cultures, but has culture types separated by time interacting with one-another. Skellige is predominantly a depiction of early/high medieval Scandinavia, but also stands in for other early/high medieval cultures. Nilfgaard is kind of like Germany's Holy Roman Empire, but a great deal of its cultural influence comes directly from ancient Rome. The continental Northern Kingdoms are like late medieval central Europe, being predominantly related to Slavic and Germanic cultures from the time (especially where these cultural influences are likely to cross over -- see Poland itself, naturally, but also the likes of Austria). 

Sorry, I went off the rails a little there. I think the English voice work in this game does a really good job of conveying a series of medieval societies that doesn't actually include a direct equivalent of late medieval England.

I didn't say being a Christian was European, but being a ""good Christian"", by which I mean one that follows the modern socially acceptable ethical guidelines of the new testament and the teachings of Jesus, specifically the attention to the weakest elements of society. In American English vernacular these are considered fairly synonymous. Those values are without a doubt European, as shown by our development and protection of human rights and social welfare.

Also, I'm not a Christian but Christianity has absolutely shaped European culture and behavior whether you like it or not.   Compassion for the weak and poor is as stereotypically Christian as one can be.

Well it's not quite that ironic. Germany has still had same sex partnership recognition since 2001.

This act in 2006 also extended to transgendered people and included access to goods and service (no turning away of gay people by bakers).

So whilst you say it is ironic it is important to recognise that the difference is a 'name only' thing in the marriage debate. Not one I condone of as separate but equal is rarely equal.

La Liga has confirmed that it did not receive the relevant documents for the agreement by its deadline of midnight on August 31 and Spanish newspaper Marca, known for its close ties with Real, believes the deal is off until January at the earliest.

Following months of speculation, Real and United finally agreed a fee of £29m for De Gea, in a deal which included goalkeeper Keylor Navas going to Old Trafford in exchange for the Spain international. 

United have also told Sky Sports News HQ that they signed and sent all relevant documentation on time and that they have the evidence to prove it.

It is not yet known whether Real or United will consider an appeal over the likely cause of the delay. 

Spanish football expert Guillem Balague told Sky Sports News HQ: ""La Liga has confirmed that the documents have not reached them on time and, as it stands, the transfer is not going to take place.

""Everything was done and everyone was waiting. David de Gea was at his girlfriend's house in Madrid, [Real Madrid president] Florentino Perez was at the Santiago Bernabeu.

""Navas was there too and was waiting to pass a medical, and everything was signed and sent to Manchester.

""But the information is that the documentation didn't come back from Manchester United on time.

She goes on to say it's not impossible, but that it does pose an obstacle and a 'legal quagmire'.

&gt;When Ed Miliband was the leader of our party, efforts to put immediate renationalisation in the manifesto were thwarted. One year on, and both Andy Burnham and Jeremy Corbyn have promised to renationalise Britain’s railway network.  The debate has certainly shifted left, but could either Andy or Jeremy deliver on such a promise? I’m not so sure, as neither candidate have said how they would address the big obstacle that their promise faces: the European Union.

&gt;Undoubtedly EU law will be a huge obstacle to any renationalisation scheme – especially one that aims to do away with competition and markets. The EU is clear that its objective is “Opening up national freight and passenger markets to cross-border competition”. Its directives and regulations have created what can only be described as a legal quagmire.

&gt;The main EU law in this area was the First Railway Directive (which was replaced and upgraded in 2012 with a new version). This was the original law that gave the Tories the excuse they needed to introduce their privatisation agenda in the nineties. That law enshrined the role of the private sector by making it a legal requirement for independent companies to be able to apply for non-discriminatory track access on a member state’s track, calling for:

       “separating [of] the management of railway 
        operation and infrastructure from the provision 
        of railway transport services, separation of 
        accounts being compulsory and organizational

I was wandering the halls of the exhibition hall with my wife and we were just checking out games here and there. XCOM had a pretty huge display and booth set up and we saw the ""X-COM: ENEMY UNKNOWN"" banners constantly while walking around but we ignored them for the most part, knowing nothing of the game. At some point on the second or third day of the convention we were standing around and weren't sure what to do. We happened to be standing beside the XCOM booth so we decided to hop in line, still knowing absolutely nothing about the game. We hadn't actually bothered to look at anything about the game other than the title so I still don't know why we decided to line up. We were expecting some generic alien FPS, like a modern DOOM.

The line took us a couple of hours to get through (turned out we decided to line up when it was at its longest that day) and once we got through they ushered us into a little briefing room with room for about 20 of us. They played us the trailer and gave us a rundown of the game before letting us loose on the demo stations for about 20 minutes. The demo was a lot of fun but it didn't really give enough time to get into ant-farm base management and research portion of the game which is really satisfying.

Even after the enoyable demo at PAX though the game still mostly went under my radar and it wasn't until xmas of that year when I was visiting a friend that he got me to play some ""couch coop"" XCOM (trade the controller back and choose who orders which soldier).

**Reason**

Reason is a Danish Team that is Tier 3 Globally. They have not played against many teams on the same level as HR and when they have it has usually resulted in a loss. They have shown mixed results against teams of their own level and often go to overtime to clutch out wins. They will most likely not have the experience to beat a team such as HR unless they have studied them intensely.

---
---

**HR**

HR is a CIS team that is Tier 2 Globally. HR has been around for quite a while now and the players on their team seem to sometimes take turns in deciding who can carry and who wants to come out on fire and really stick it to some teams. They have most recently achieved really good results at APM coming in 1^st . Toppling TSM 2-0 in a BO3 there. However recently (the past 2 days) the results they have shown us have been less then stellar. Going down to an under performing Titan and not taking at least a map off E-Frag. I still believe they contain the capacity to come back after a rough couple of days and this game might be the good one for them to ease back into it. They don't usually play against teams on the level of Reason and may get caught out by some unorthodox maps.  There are no more obvious negatives I can think of for them heading into this match.

**Conclusion:**

**TL;DR** HR should win this one, however Reason stands a decent chance.

My Odds: 80:20

My Bet: Medium on HR

Recommended Bet: Medium on HR if odds stay above 80:20. ICB (1%) if they drop below that.

There are a dozen ways to move towards a solution. Changing the asylum system, no more residence permits, no more integration, all refugees remain refugees with one goal of being returned, no housing, just asylum centers, no work, just preparation to return and aid the country they ran from in rebuilding. (if necessary provide free education for skills that will be needed in post-war Syria/...)

Reception centers outside Europe, occupied safe zones in Syria and Libya, boots on the ground and restoration of order in said countries, military/rented planes to transport them quickly and legally and relieve the pressure from bordering countries.

Try to keep as many refugees directly in the region, try to give as many aid as local countries need in taking care of them (food, water, tents, medicines, protection) Zero tolerance policy for economic immigrants.

Unfortunately Europe is incredibly weak and incapable of following any consistent policy, there's a chance conflicts will break out between European countries soon now and lord knows where that will lead.

As for Eastern Europe being special, we do know that a lot of Eastern European males died in the 1900s, that Eastern European males have a shorter age of living, and this kind of aggressive selection of course affects a community.

If this trend was true over several thousand years, there's no question Eastern European females would evolve traits that lead to a higher reproduction rate. The changes could include anything from a selection-oriented appearance, to improved ability to foster children on their own, and so on.

I think for a start up it makes perfect sense that those who start the company are extremely experienced in what they are doing (also not always the case look at tech break throughs). Even MS when Gates started it he had little experience in the workfield yet he did very well in the long run.

Now when you get to the huge size of HP/IBM/MS there is a change about what a company is. I used to work for an extremely large construction company but while I have a degree in engineering I also have one in finance and architecture, I noticed that what I was doing was more about how to deal with money smartly then the actual build. Sure it's our core business to build stuff, but we make more money on the financial agreements then the actual margins on the trade itself.

Now tech companies who employ 100.000+ people are so huge that while it doesn't hurt knowing engineering, I think at such size business is more beneficial. Consider for example that these companies benefit (or loose) huge amounts of money when the CNY goes up/down to the USD. Or when the EU start bonking Google in the ass, again what is the essence here, great software engineering, or walking the fine lines in a political world.

&gt; It's also funny when people pretend to know asylum laws and all the international treaties. Every country can decide its rules and can accept way more people than they have to or they can choose the strict application of the treaties.

Sweden and Germany are simply not dodging their obligations. If a Syrian were to apply for asylum in any Eastern European country, it will be basically impossible to deny that request.

&gt; And refugees don't have only rights, but also obligations. And one of the main obligation of a refugee is to ask asylum in the first safe country. When they come to Czechia or germany, they already went through like dozen of safe countries, they are illegal immigrants.

No, that's not an obligation for the refugee. A refugee is a person that is displaced from their country, full stop:

 &gt;   (...) the term ""refugee"" shall apply to any person who (...) owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.

From the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The ""they have to stay in the first safe country"" is just made up. Of course it is, it would put way too much of a burden on the neighbouring countries of any crisis. So, what you are doing amounts to claiming that Jews who fled Germany in 1933 and tried to go to America rather than France are illegal immigrants. It's ridiculous.

However, European countries have agreed to a safe country rule in that they expect the first EU country to handle all refugees. That's what's known as the Dublin regulation.

1441100886,"Thanks for sharing ""ROLLTIDE4EVER,"" how was the Trump rally in Mobile, by the way?

On to the article: 

The article is very articulately written -- Kudos to the Author, a man with a PhD. in economics from Auburn. That's right Mr. Roll Tide, this man is from your rival school.

He raises a few baseless fears, and proceeds to destroy them with shameless speculation. 

&gt;I believe it is important to note that when socialists speak of “victories” in the economy, they are not talking about actual results, but rather political achievements in the forms of laws being passed that mandate certain policies. . .  results are irrelevant to socialists.

Clearly he does not see the revival of the American middle class as an ""actual result"" that's worth fighting for. Nor does he even mention raising the wages of women to those of men. No, he sees corporate profits as the only ""result"" worth fighting for, and clearly supports the trade policies that have helped export decent paying jobs overseas. 

He goes on to describe the ""Bernie Sanders regime,"" as using economic models similar to those of ""Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini"", and then he skillfully transitions into comparing him to Franklin Delano Roosevelt -- who, apparently in his mind, is also worth comparing to some of the world's worst dictators to ever walk the earth.

That is not to discredit the author -- as I said, he is very articulate and his rhetoric is carefully chosen. However, it's not hard to see that this entire article is speculative fiction with skewed perspectives of historical elements, and contemporary fear-mongering references thrown in as well. 

He turns a willfully blind eye to the outrages and injustices in the American socio-economic system, in favor of discrediting all socialists -- and he makes little distinction between the Socialism of the 1780's and the Democratic Socialism of modern Western Europe. Furthermore, at the end of the article he pessimistically states that American attempts at socialism would not look like those in other modern Democratically elected governments in Western Europe, oh no -- he says the U.S. would look more like Venezuela after the death of Hugo Chavez. He does this without stating his reasoning behind this speculation.

Not with the intent to hide it, but it doesn't have any legitimate substance.

1441102533,"Critically, the full IR course in Europe is extremely expensive - at least fifty hours in school aeroplanes [or licensed simulators] that cost 30-70% more than a rental in the States. The ground school and exams are also very tough. There are also only a limited number of schools that offer it and they usually suggest that you take a lot of time out from your career to live nearby and do it intensively, something that's not practical for a thirtysomething family man.

The Restricted IR is 15 hours, can be taught almost anywhere, covers broadly the same topics (crucially missing out holds and holding!) and training, but you can't use it in Class A airspace or outside of the UK (and the minima are more restrictive). You're taught to fly, navigate and approach/land in IMC so you're fully capable (in theory, currency and aptitude permitting) of flying IFR and getting from A to B with a much lower cost/training overhead.

Also as /u/blueb0g mentioned, you're then able to build up some instrument flying hours to make the full Instrument Rating a little less unobtainable.

It's worth noting that a basic European PPL has *no* night training or night flying privileges, perhaps one hour of VOR tracking and *maybe* 30 minutes of instrument flying as part of the training syllabus.

&gt; David von Mering and Carter Schultz of Wayland, MA create music that finds its roots in reggae, acoustic pop and indie rock, with smooth guitar riffs and a strong rap component.  After releasing their mixtapes “Water On The Moon” and “The Reach” in late-2010 and mid-2011 respectively, the guys proceeded to release their first iTunes EP “What You Need” in October of 2011. “What You Need” would go on to reach the #1 spot on iTunes hip-hop charts.  David and Carter started working on their debut full-length as soon as they got back from their first tour (they showered first) and finished just in time for a fun summer in 2012.  Aer’s July 30th, 2012 debut album The Bright Side quickly rose to #1 on the iTunes Album Charts and earned a spot in Billboards Hot 100. It was followed by “The Bright Side Tour” which spanned over 48 cities across North America, more tour dates around the country, a Europe tour in May, and their music played on NFL Network, an Etnies advertisement featuring Ryan Scheckler, and three episodes of the Real World.  To date, the band has shared the stage with Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis, Slightly Stoopid, Action Bronson, Iggy Azalea, ASAP Rocky, Hoodie Allen, and more.  Carter and David are 19 and 20 respectively, and have a lot more music to make.

Also this is the most sobering piece of text I've seen in British Politics

&gt;Fact No. 1 is that in the modern world even the Super Powers like America and Russia do not have complete freedom of action. Medium-sized nations like Britain are more and more subject to economic and political forces we cannot control on our own.
A striking recent example of the impact of such forces is the way the Arab oil-producing nations brought about an energy and financial crisis not only in Britain but throughout a great part of the world.
Since we cannot go it alone in the modern world, Britain has for years been a member of international groupings like the United Nations, NATO and the International Monetary Fund.
Membership of such groupings imposes both rights and duties, but has not deprived us of our national identity, or changed our way of life.
Membership of the Common Market also imposes new rights and duties on Britain, but does not deprive us of our national identity. To say that membership could force Britain to eat Euro-bread or drink Euro-beer is nonsense.

I am residing in Lithuania.

* Do you speak any languages besides English? (If yes: which and to what level?)

Russian: understanding at B2, writing at A2, Speaking at A1

* What interests you about Europe?

I mostly am looking for diffrent perspectives of any subject.  It fascinates me how diffrent we think and yet the majority of us are in the union.

* What are your favourite and least favourite things about /r/europe?

My favourite thing: redditors, least favourite thing: redditors.

* Do you have experience as a moderator or similar?

As a reddit moderator, no.
Only in a few smaller Lithuanian forums.

* Why do you want to be a moderator?

I want my nickname as well as Lithuanian flag under moderators list. But with all seriousness I despise aggresive or offenisve comments.

* why do you think you would be a good moderator?

I like to have power. Well, no, not really. Usually when I am doing something, I am serious about it.

Only with statistics.

What they do say is that they aim for the countries they think have the highest chance to work and build their lives up again. They aim for northern and western Europe because those countries offer the best wages and have the lowest unemployment rate.

1441111071,"It's long been known that the EU favours free-market economics, which is why it baffles me that so many in Labour, a party which is largely in favour of nationalisation schemes (apart from the power hungry bottom-feeders in the Blairite wing) has become Europhile to the point of straight up refusing the UK public a referendum at the last election - a ridiculous decision in light of public demand that made them look anti-democratic and which probably contributed to their unelectability.

If Corbyn wins, the referendum will get very interesting indeed: I'm convinced that it's only the coaxing of traditional Labour voters into supporting the EU post Clause 4 under Blair and Brown that is preventing a big block of voters choosing to leave. Jeremy has himself said that he would not support an EU that has corporate interests at its heart, which it always has done and always will, so if he is leading the party heading into a vote and backed as it sounds like he will be by a number of unions, there could be a big boost to the ""out"" campaign.

It will read something like this:

**In**: ""Wet"" Conservatives , Blairite Labour , Lib Dems, Green, SNP, Plaid Cymru, Some Unions

**Out**: Eurosceptic Conservatives, Traditional Labour now , UKIP, DUP, TUSC and other socialist parties, Most Unions

The political balance is still seemingly in favour of the ""in"" campaign, but any support for ""out"" from Labour, which it seems has probably been bubbling under the surface of the Blairite facade for a number of years, makes the playing field more even.

False,"I got into the C&amp;C games primarily with the original Red Alert. Loved the game, especially the differences between the two sides - the Allies were fast but weak. The Soviets were slow, but tough as nails. Tank rushing was the primary tactic of both sides - especially the Soviets. Get a Mammoth wall constructed and it could roll over everything. But beyond that, I liked the tone of the game, along with Tiberium Dawn and Tiberium Sun. In Dawn, the world was rife with war which was being percipitated due to the presence of this new, dangerous and lucrative alien plant. The Nod took the opportunity to stir up the pot as they could fund a war machine with the easy access to valuable minerals. In Sun, the danger of Tiberium was ramped up - no longer a useful little plant, it was fast becoming a global pandemic. Red Alert had the same tone - there was no alien plant, but the what if factor of killing Hitler allowed the Red Army to gain steam and begin rolling over Europe.

But ... that tone started to shift. Red Alert 2, while excellent, began the descent into cheeky territory, with Yuri and his mind control. It was still dark in tone and if you accepted the existence of mind control, the theater of war was entertaining. Red Alert 3 took the game into campy directions. The story, the units, the tech ... it was a bit too silly. And the game mechanics were modified such that battle didn't feel as entertaining as it did before. Same with Tiberium Twilight. The games units and powers and story started bordering on the ridiculous over time. C&amp;C 4 was garbage and I refuse to call it a proper C&amp;C game.

Depuis on en est largement revenus et pour ma part  je considère que ça a été un bain de sang immonde avec un peuple qui n'était plus maître de ses pulsions les plus viles. On a remplacé un absolutisme par des dictatures successives (Robespierre, Napoléon), la guillotine a fait des dizaines de milliers de morts et la guerre civile entre royalistes et républicains a été un véritable massacre. 

Ce qui n'empêche et m'en déplaise, qu'il y a eu aussi des retombées positives : abolition de privilèges injustes, création des départements, déclaration des droits de l'homme, liberté de penser etc.

Pour ce qui est de Louis XIV 

- Il est vrai qu'il a mené une politique extérieure qu'on peut qualifier de ""belliqueuse"" mais il faut se rappeler du contexte : les traités de Westphalie et des Pyrénées sont tout frais, la France est devenue une puissance que tous ses voisins supportent mal et qu'ils n'hésiteront pas à briser à la première occasion. Louis XIV avait de plus un casus belli valable pour la reprise des hostilités avec l'Espagne : qu'on lui remette la juste part de l'héritage de son épouse l'Infante.

- La petite paysannerie est effectivement percluse d'impôts, mais il faut considérer tous les aspects de la question : c'est aussi le signe de la modernisation de l'administration et de la mise en place d'un pouvoir central fort, ce qui est une bonne chose, tout Etat s'efforçant de sécuriser ses rentrées d'argent. Après il faut voir l'usage qu'on en fait, dans l'exemple qu'on prend ici c'est la guerre qui grevait le budget mais quand on voit le gâchis qui se pratique toujours maintenant à d'autres niveaux, ça se vaut...

- ""écraser la monarchie pour mieux régner"", je ne peux que supposer que tu parlais de la noblesse puisque la monarchie c'est le roi. Il faut bien comprendre que le grand traumatisme de Louis XIV c'est la Fronde, à partir de ce moment son unique obsession est d'écarter à jamais tout risque de révolte/guerre civile/coup d'Etat menés par les nobles. Il avait assurément à y gagner, mais les révoltes endémiques des siècles/décennies précédentes ne bénéficiaient généralement à personne, bien au contraire. Ces guerres civiles étaient une plaie pour le peuple comme pour le roi et le règne de Louis XIV a connu une période de paix et de prospérité relative en ce qui concerne la politique intérieure.

- Versailles était un instrument parmi d'autres utilisés par Louis XIV pour assoir ce pouvoir central qu'il voulait absolu. On a du mal à imaginer à notre époque matérialiste à quel point nos ainés étaient pénétrés de symbolisme, et quelqu'un ayant des prétentions absolues se devait de les manifester absolument dans tous les domaines. Versailles est l'incarnation de cette idée, un lieu destiné à impressionner et plus fonctionnellement, à fixer toute une noblesse que les nouvelles règles de la vie de cour visent à rendre inoffensive. Je peux comprendre que tu écrives sur le coup de la colère mais tu es de mauvaise foi si tu ne reconnais pas l'impact culturel et la prouesse technique et architecturale que constitue Versailles. Quant aux sanitaires ma foi, c'est l'époque qui veut ça, reproches-tu aux indiens d'Amazonie qui n'ont pas mieux de se torcher avec des feuilles ? Niveau complots je ne suis pas bien convaincu que ç'ait été pire avant ou depuis, la politique c'est avant tout de la magouille et des gens bouffés d'ambition. Le mieux qu'un peuple puisse jamais espérer, c'est que les intérêts personnels de ses politiques recoupent brièvement celui du pays.

- Encore une fois, il faut voir ce que tu mets sur le vocable ""massacre"" mais je ne pense pas qu'on ait fait pire ou mieux que ce qui se pratiquait à l'époque.

- Pour les quelques points que j'évoquais comme pour le reste (famines, progression de la domination anglaise, prévalence de la France en Europe) tu te livres à des réductions grossières, ce genre de phénomènes résulte généralement d'une myriade de causes qui interagissent de façon complexe. De plus c'est toujours facile de démêler le ""sens"" apparent de l'Histoire après coup, surtout quand on se donne une orientation, mais les choses sont rarement aussi simples sur le moment. On peine encore à voir le bout qui va devant en ce qui concerne l'Ukraine, t'aventurerais-tu à résumer la situation par ""le méchant Poutine veut tout pour lui et fait chier le monde"" ? Ce serait naïf.

Sinon ma foi c'est de Louis XIV qu'il est question sur ce fil, je serais tout aussi heureux de discuter d'un autre monarque, je ne comprends pas bien le sens de ta remarque. 

C'est un peu comme demander ""Pourquoi la main que j'ai mise dans mon verre d'eau est mouillée ?""

False,"And there are people coming from Somalia, Eritrea, Ghana, Bangladesh, Pakistan and many other African and Asian countries, even if there are no wars going on.

There is an important distinction to be made between refugees from war-torn Syria, and migrants from relatively stable African countries.
People from the second group don't move because they fear for their lives, but mostly because they think they'll have a better life in (western) Europe, and this is in part true because living standards are higher and there's a large system of social welfare.

There are 2 sides to the ""crisis"".
For refugees and migrants, they have to take dangerous routes to reach Europe, and many drown in the Mediterranean because they try to make it across on crappy little boats. 
They think it's worth the risk because the European countries are patrolling the waters of Libya and 'rescue' every boat they find by dragging the people to Italy. However, not every boat is found on time and people drown.

For the countries in Europe, there are different problems:

1) The asylum system gets clogged up. Refugees should be the only ones making use of (temporary) shelter, not economic migrants. Too many people requesting asylum at the same time, not enough resources to process the applications. Germany and Sweden are especially popular destinations cause of their tolerant policies, and Italy and Greece receive a large share of the influx due to their geographic locations.

2) Housing. Because asylum centres are full, people need to be moved into other forms of housing.
 In my country there are houses assigned to lower income classes, which are basically state-subsidized. There are waiting lists for these houses as there are severe shortages in low-income housing, especially in bigger cities where citizens have to wait for over 15 years in some cases to be assigned a house. 
Now with an influx of people through the asylum system, these houses are assigned to them, as they have priority. You can imagine the outrage among people who have been waiting for a house for years, only to have their wait bumped by another few years cause there isn't enough room to go around.

3) The social welfare system is under pressure. Many migrants lack the education and language skills to perform jobs for which there is a high demand (scientists, teachers, nurses etc), and there aren't enough low-level/blue collar jobs for everyone, so they often receive some form of welfare. In the Netherlands for example, 70% of Somalians are on welfare, without ever having paid into it through taxes. Plus there's pbulic health care, schooling etc., all of which costs taxpayer money. If migration continues like this, either the working part of the population has to pay more taxes (which are already high), or the system of social welfare and public services needs to be reduced, which would not be good for people who are struggling.

Dunno if this is the answer you were looking for, but in TL;DR
People coming from war-torn countries (e.g. Syria, Iraq)
People coming for economic reasons (e.g. Bangladesh, some African countries)
European countries not having resources to take everyone in, plus certain countries receiving more people than others.",cumy7cb,t3_3j6jrx,,0,t1_cumqqmt,t5_2sokd,0,1444107337,6,6,,,explainlikeimfive,qspure,1441111660

**Matchmaker**

* Implemented a ""mirror balance"" for aircraft carriers in terms of their number and tier in almost all cases (except for extremely rare occasions when the waiting time in queue is longer than the maximum time allowed).
* Implemented interruption of a series of battles that a player takes part in where the player's ship tier is lower that the level of the battle
* Now, the matchmaker distributes destroyers more evenly between opposite teams, when a battle is created.
 

**Game Maps**

Added two new maps: 
**Straight**:

The map features an Italian coast where, in 1940, for the first time ever heavy ships were attacked solely by carrier-based aviation. This operation ""inspired"" Japan's massive assault on Pearl Harbor. In 1943, the Allied fleet supported Operation ""Husky"", Operation ""Avalanche"" and many other operations of great importance for wartime achievements in Europe.

- Size: 36x36 km

- Modes: Standard Battle, Domination (3 key areas).

 

**Solomon Islands:**

One of the major Pacific Ocean campaigns carried out during World War II that took place in the vicinity of the Solomon Islands archipelago.  Battles continued from 1942 until 1945. During 1942-1943, the largest sea battle - the Guadalcanal Campaign - took place in the waters of the archipelago. A strategically important airport Henderson Field is located on the island. After the battle, the U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, ""It would seem that the turning point in this war has at last been reached.""

- Size: 30x30 km

- Modes: Standard Battle, Domination (3 key areas)

 
Other map changes:  
* Added foliage to the following maps: North, Big Race, Islands, Hotspot, New Dawn, Two Brothers and Fault Line  
* Fixed gameplay components of the following maps: New Dawn and Fault Line  
* Disabled the initial diagonal placement of teams and the Domination mode (with 5 key areas) on the Hotspot map.  
 

**Graphics**

* Implemented a new technology of foliage visualization on maps
 

**Sound**

* Made an overall improvement of sound effects in the game.
* Reworked the sounds of nearby flying shells. 
* Improved the sound effects of jet-powered aircraft. 
* Work is under way to improve performance.
* Added new music tracks.
 

**Interface**

* Now, ship's characteristics are displayed taking into account the equipment mounted on the ship.
* Improved visualization of three-dimensional game interfaces
* Implemented the display of licensers in the game client
* Added an IME language panel (can be enabled in the Settings)
* Added input support for the Chinese, Korean and Japanese languages.
* Improved the Summary tab in the player's profile
* Implemented the option to display battle statistics separately for Co-op, Standard and Ranked Battles

**System Changes**

* Added a change that will substantially simplify aiming at a ship moving over the border of the map (""kiting"")",cumyikq,t3_3j7m17,非理法権天,0,t1_cumyfnq,t5_2t8uj,0,1444107483,15,15,,ijn,WorldOfWarships,syanda,1441112442

It's been a place to prove your worth for a while and im glad that first effects of FPL already came in this big roster shuffle.

This means a lot to new players, especially the completely unknown ones who qualified from FACEIT (There will be ~10 of them in FPL till 5th September).

A lot of them were earning some good amounts of money in FPL, which also helps them in some way to keep training and pursue their eSports career. This time we discussed with the pros if we should take a step further and host a big LAN, together with our CS:GO FPL (Which is having huge success over there in Europe, with all top teams/players playing all day, every day). This LAN will allow us to form a direct pipeline that talented pubstars can use to show their worth on FACEIT, qualify for FPL and from nowhere end up on LAN with some of the best players on Dota2 in front of a huge crowd, and in mean time earn enough cash on monthly basis (and who knows, maybe on LAN aswell) to pay for your living costs/afford training all day long and not give up on your dreams.

Lack of?  The US produces a total of 508.4 terawatts, while the EU produces 755.7 terawatts. We're not exactly super far behind in this regard, so I don't know what you're on about. 

The US is the third largest producer of renewable energy worldwide, closely behind the EU which is in 2nd.

So, again, it's bullshit to say that the US and China are squarely responsible for this mess, or that we're not doing anything or enough.

But, in the grand scheme of things, I really think it was blown out of proportion.  

&gt;  Because keeping the new name is a reminder. It's a reminder of being a second class-citizen in your homeland. It's a reminder of losing your national identity.

That can be said about any name.  By any people.  Frankly, by that logic, we should abandon the entire U.S.A and go back to whatever the fuck in was called in 5000 BC.  

I, for one, prefer Persia rather than Iran.  And I am also in favor of bringing back Sparta and the Ottoman Empire.   

Most of Europe should be renamed because it offends my Roman ancestry.  To what end?  

One could argue that the Athabascan people were not the original settlers anyhow.  And they likely did some sheisty shit to inherit that land as well.  

When we are talking in terms of 'land ownership', who really has any right?  If you take it back far enough, the whole matter really becomes silly.

Because everyone would be butthurt about any number of names.  

The whole matter was simply political and served only to distract from actual issues facing our nation today.  Not relics of butthurt from 600 years ago.  

Perhaps Native Americans should stop being butthurt and face real issues facing their people today.

In November 1986 after 13 games, when Fergie took charge, they were already out of the League cup, in the 4th round, and were in 21st in a 22 team league.

No matter how you try and spin how they had performed in the early 80s by the time Fergie joined they were in disarray. Knocked out of the League cup early and in the relegation zone is a team that is truly in trouble.

Compared to that before Moyes Utd hadn't been in the lower half of the table in over a decade. They hadn't finished outside the top 2 in 8 years. They had won the league the year before. Even under Moyes they never dropped below 12th (for one week before bouncing back to 9th) and made it to the semi-final of the league cup.

There is literally no standard that you can compare the state of the team that Fergie inherited to the state of the teams that Moyes or Van Gaal inherited.

That doesn't mean we're going to go out and get PhD in Hungarian history, but that does mean that we have some basic interests in the country our ancestors came from.

1441118138,"Well that was a long time, but I will break down the Red Scare and McCarthy and focus on those things.

The ""Red Scare"" as it is often referred to was a time right after WWII (1945) when socialism was a very powerful force around the world, which the American government, and people feared. At this point I'll put in a disclaimer, I am a communist and have some pretty strong opinions on this era, but I will keep my explanation as unbiased as I can. 

Why did the government fear communism? Because it meant the end of the US government, if socialism was to take hold in America, the world would be turned upside down, the rich would have no power and no wealth, private property would be abolished and for these reasons, the elite class of America and the US government were very much anti-communist. Many people were as well, usually because of propaganda and fear.

So why was the US government so paranoid of communism in the 1950's? Well there was this theory in socialism referred to as the international revolution, and Americans often referred to it as the domino affect. Basically, communism is an international deal, capitalism must die *everywhere*, and when one nation fell to communism, usually the next one to fall would be their neighbour, like a domino. For example, this happened in Eastern Europe, the USSR annexed Romania and Poland and Eastern Germany, then Yugoslavia and Albania became socialist, when China fell to communism in 1949, only 4 years later was North Korea formally established, then there was Vietnam. So there was a real, serious, credible fear of communism by the US government.

Who was McCarthy? He was a senator from Wisconsin ~~and head of the of the un-american activities committee~~ I have been reminded that the Congressional committee, and the senate committee was the Senate Committee on Government Operations and it's Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. which accused many of Americans of being communists, had a hand in making socialist organisations illegal, accused many famous writers and Hollywood film makers of being communists, all without real evidence, and furthermore, being a communist should not be illegal according to the constitution. Some ended up arrested, some left the country, everyone who was accused by McCarthy had their lives destroyed by a 21st century equivalent of a witch hunt. And to this day the far left in America are nearly non-existant.

1441120878,"She was just as racist as anthropologists of her time, so I don't know that ""she was racist toward Australian Aboriginal people"" is *painting the most accurate picture.  She referenced what was considered the knowledge of the time in one of her writings, and it certainly sounds super wrong.  Which was what anthropologists of the time were discussing.  How close to apes their development was, as compared to Europeans, and how they were not as evolved as Europeans etc.


Ultimately it just depends on how you use the term ""Racist.""  I think it's grossly oversimplifying the time to say she was ""very racist towards"" anyone.  It certainly is, by definition, racist, to say that a race is inferior, or not as developed as another.  Which is exactly what anthropologists in the 19th and 20th century did.  But I don't know that her referencing their, albeit problematic, work makes her ""very racist toward"" them *in our current understanding of what that might mean.  BUT congratulations on being one of the few people to actually mention something really gross that she actually said.

For the curious, from What Every Girl Should Know:
&gt;It is said a fish as large as a man has a brain no larger than the kernel of an almond. In all fish and reptiles where there is no great brain development, there is also no conscious sexual control. The lower down in the scale of human development we go the less sexual control we find.

False,"In the janitor example, what does some old reference on the website site map  ... and let's not pretend there's anything more to it ... have to do with it?  The janitor and I have provided you the latest information from a CBS employee.  I haven't heard anyone dispute it, so it must be valid.

That is your argument, after all.   This is why rank matters, and why the latest isn't automatically the greatest.

Besides, if you want to split hairs, the singular statement on the StarTrek.com website wherein the database is described as ""The Offical Star Trek Canon"" actually nullifies all the live-action series in favor of the database.  No really . . . the ""videos"" section wherein one can ""Watch your favorite Star Trek episodes right here"" is separate.  So, congratulations . . . you've just decanonized every episode and film in favor of a poorly-maintained database.  'Cause, y'know, *that's* a good plan.

In any case, your argument regarding the database as ""actively maintained"" as if someone's paying close attention to it all the time isn't entirely true.  I noticed last night that they literally just recently included *Into Darkness*, which as of this discussion in the comments to a video of mine a couple of months ago they had not (e.g. the only Carol Marcus was Bibi):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VsRvLpQpFc

Here's the Wayback to demonstrate:  http://web.archive.org/web/20150629010503/http://www.startrek.com/sitemap

The change has apparently come in the run-up to the new film, presumably at the behest of Paramount.  (Edit:  That means  it only took them three years to add the sequel to 2009.  Nice.)  

And indeed, there's a teachable moment here.  In the minds of many fans, corporate suits are as worried about canon and correct dissemination of the policy thereon as we are.  But in the real world, that just isn't so.  

Suits don't care.  Even many of the creatives don't.

(This is how you ended up with the dual canons of Star Wars pre-Disney (the EU's internal stuff and the Lucas canon where the EU didn't come into play).  And virtually nothing about canon came out of what we would consider official channels like press releases or such.)

To your mind, the database is lovingly and lavishly maintained by people who are all serious and somber keeping always in mind the idea that someone somewhere might chance upon the site map's throwaway reference to canon.  But in the real world, the limited staff is just CBS Consumer Products guys who inherited the old site from Gaskill's Viacom gang, and they only mess with the messy old antique database they inherited as business logic demands.   Considering they burned down the forums and are now linking to fan sites like Memory Alpha it's kinda surprising they're maintaining the old database at all.  But, it's a free chunk of content that requires (and gets) little attention, so why not.

But if you consider the business logic and the technical logic, then even if there was a corporate suit who had a wild hair about it, it's quite unlikely they're going to go through and excise the TAS stuff Gaskill added.  For one, there may be overlap of tagging if there's any tagging at all, so there would be no quick ""delete all TAS"" button.  That means you'd be putting one or more people on cleanup duty for some length of time, identifying and preparing to remove entries from a database that they may be hesitant to even touch in the first place given its age . . . that's all money.

In any case, certainly there's no logical reason to suspect that a throwaway descriptor on a site map ... literally the entirety of your current evidence for the claim of TAS canonicity, just so you're clear ... is any official statement of canon policy, current or past.

Beyond that, your only evidence is Gaskill's now-deleted declarations.  I've previously described and quoted them thusly:  Once Roddenberry's crew was gone, they rewrote the canon page to note ""Ultimately, the fans, the writers and the producers may all differ on what is considered canon and the very idea of what is canon has become more fluid, especially as there isn't a single voice or arbiter to decide."" ""[N]ow that the Animated Series is out on DVD, we hope that even more can make its way in!""  ""With the recent attention afforded the Animated Series [primarily by StarTrek.com], we only felt it was fair to give it some equal weight here on the site.""

So StarTrek.com guys, for StarTrek.com, decided to include TAS.   I'm hardly going to dismiss Roddenberry, Moore, and others on that basis.

You suggest that CBS ought to have corrected the Gaskill statements, but that's nonsense.  CBS need not decanonize what wasn't canon. We have clear evidence that TAS wasn't considered canon in the TNG-ENT production era at Roddenberry's behest. We also know that Gaskill started treating it as canon at his own behest after that era ended and during the lack of oversight at the time of the Viacom split until he was laid off in 2007, we know that his statements have since been deleted, and we have further learned that the StarTrek.com database available today is just a Gaskill holdover not being updated religiously, suggesting a minimal amount of effort is being put into it.

Put simply, pre-Gaskill, pre-Viacom-split canon policy statements are still operative, as far as I am concerned, and I firmly believe this to be the proper conclusion of any fan who reviews the facts in an unbiased manner. 

I realize you seek to ascribe personal dislike or personal disagreement against TAS to me, seeking to append personal motivations to me inappropriately, but I am operating on the basis of fact and logic.  I would request the same of you.

But, just to defend myself personally on that point . . . I like TAS.  There are parts of TAS I would love to see canonized.  But it just isn't a supportable position, logically speaking.

2) He said he once had his leg dangling over the bed and something grabbed him and pulled him completely under the bed, then nothing happened and he screamed and cried and ran off to mum who thought nothing of it.

3) As i was 6 years younger than my brother, im not sure if nothing actually happened to me or if I am too young to knowledge if anything did but I slept in my own room with the door open also. It wasn't until we have relatives from Europe come visit that I had to sleep in my brothers room on the floor. I awoke in the middle of the night and could see a transparent male figure in a coat with a hat and glasses, similar to what you see in the drawings here http://humansarefree.com/2013/12/the-real-men-in-black-complete-accounts.html. It just observed me for what seemed like an eternity, everything was dead silent and i was fucking terrified. Then it dissapeared down the hallway, i waited a while then fucking legged it screaming to my parents bedroom. They told it it was ""street lights"". Thats all the only thing that ever happened to me in that house or any other future houses.

3) My mother reports that once she awoke fully paralyzed, and saw a man in a ""space suit"" heading towards the kids bedrooms. 

4) My father, completely rejected anything we would say as nonsense and that it was all in our heads ect. It wasn't until 10 years later that talking to him did he finally open up and tell us how crazy that house was. His biggest thing was there was 3 perfectly burnt circles in the backyard, slightly bigger than the underside of a lawnmower which he told my mother was his doing. The rest he refused to tell me because we were with some friends who has little children and didn't want to freak them out. 

As soon as we moved out, my brothers night terrors stopped, and none of us experienced anything else ""paranormal"". Despite my experiences, I am extremely skeptical on the ""unexplained"". There are many things such as sleep paralysis, auto self hypnosis, suggestion, dreaming ect which account for many of these experiences as they were during periods of sleep apart from the lawn mower circles. I'm currently studying psychology and its amazing how easily our minds can misinterpret or deceive ourselves not just imaginatively but also in physical experience. 

I've always thought about knocking on the door of the current owners of the house and asking them if they have ever experienced anything unusual in the house but not only is that weird, it wouldn't be fair to make them feel uneasy. 

I might call my dad tomorrow and see if he would open up about his full experience in the house because he said he had to make a lot of excuses for many of the weird shit that happened to ease our minds.",cun2uei,t3_3j5n0m,,0,t1_cun1g4t,t5_2qh1i,0,1444109588,10,10,,,AskReddit,thegr8charizard,1441121762

1441124870,"depende muito da personalidade do gestor/director/chefe, dos funcionários que trabalham contigo e dos objectivos que estão em cima da mesa. os objectivos são definidos pelo gestor/director/chefe acima de ti e tens x tempo para os atingir. é aí que entra a tua maneira de gerir, sabendo que aconteça o que acontecer, tens de atingir os objectivos dentro do prazo previsto. pq se não atingires, os chefes acima de ti vão-te foder a cabeça a ti, não é aos teus subordinados. é que tens de entender q os departamentos são parte de um puzzle maior que é a empresa e se uma peça falha, atrasa as outras e estas atrasam outras, etc, como um dominó. 

por isso, mais vale foderes a cabeça a um funcionário do que deixar que ele coloque o trabalho de toda uma equipa mal. e, consequentemente, te custe o emprego. e isto é igual em qq lado do mundo, variando alguma coisa mas não mto, independentemente de que ramo fores. 

o que acho q é específico em pt é que não temos uma cultura empresarial onde o trabalhador perceba que é uma peça num puzzle gigante e que é fundamental para que a empresa cresça. a maioria dos trabalhadores não tem noção da importância que tem na empresa, acha sempre que o trabalho dele n serve de nada e q pode fazer pouco que chega, que ninguém vai notar. mas não tem problemas nenhuns de exigir um salário mto superior àquele que os chefes dele ganham, mesmo achando lá no íntimo que o trabalho dele não é assim tão importante. não vês isto nos trabalhadores de outros países, principalmente em empresas bem geridas desses países (que também há as que não valem um chavo): a mensagem da empresa é clara e os colaboradores sabem perfeitamente os objectivos, onde estão no organigrama, o que fazem na empresa, o seu papel nos procedimentos da empresa e porque é que o que fazem na empresa é importante para a empresa. 

há mta culpa da gestão nesta maneira do trabalhador ver a empresa, não digo que não. mas tb há mto a ideia comunista enraizada em pt de q o patrão é o inimigo que o quer explorar e que é um alvo a abater. está tão ultrapassada essa ideia nas empresas modernas que nem sei como é que ainda há gente que pensa assim, seja patrão seja trabalhador. hoje, o trabalhador tem de ter noção que o patrão precisa dele para conseguir o lucro. e o patrão tem de perceber que tem de ser justo e partilhar parte do lucro em incentivos ao trabalhador senão o trabalhador não vai dar o seu melhor. e se não partilhar pq quer investir, tem de explicar ao trabalhador o q quer para a empresa e pq é q n vai dar incentivos aos trabalhadores - para q possam ter maiores lucros no futuro.

o método que me dá maior controle sobre a situação é todos os dias ter reuniões para ver em que ponto estão as coisas e decidir que acções tomar nesse dia para corrigir o que há para corrigir. assim, sei sempre em q ponto estamos no cronograma e sei o q é preciso para chegar ao fim. e é aqui que conta a experiência do gestor e aquilo que o torna tão bem pago, quando estás em cargos elevados:  seres capaz de prever os problemas que podem surgir, saberes resolvê-los e saberes o que fazer para recuperar o tempo perdido. um gestor, quando tem soluções e fez o seu trabalho de casa, não precisa de berrar com os funcionários pq já lhes disse duas ou três semanas antes que aquilo que está a acontecer era uma possibilidade e está toda a gente preparada para o imprevisto.

quando vires um chefe aos berros com os funcionários, das três uma: ou perdeu o controle à situação e não sabe o que fazer e berra para mostrar que a culpa é dos funcionários quando é dele (a mais habitual); ou está a tentar meter uma equipa completamente desordeira na ordem; ou acha que a única maneira de controlar uma equipa é usando tácticas militares, removendo a personalidade ao funcionário e não o deixando quase pensar por si, estando sempre em cima deles com ordens para não fugirem um milímetro à ideia que o chefe tem (exemplo máximo desta maneira de gerir na prática? jorge jesus).

não sou a favor de berros mas já tive duas equipas de trabalhadores que se estavam pura e simplesmente a cagar (ex do que faziam: entregavam trabalho três dias depois do prazo sem qq justificação, saídas constantes para tomar café e trabalhos que qq caloiro de 1º ano fazia melhor) e tive de impor-me e berrar e andar sempre em cima deles. no caso deles, funcionou. acabou-se a brincadeira e começaram a trabalhar. teve de ser, senão era chamado lá acima, perguntavam-me pelo trabalho que me pediram e eu dizia ""ah, sabe, os trabalhadores são uns preguiçosos e não consegui fazer nada"". a resposta imediata do teu chefe é ""e você não foi capaz de os meter na ordem porquê?"". podes ter a certeza que deste um passo grande para o despedimento nesse dia.

acredita que me dava mto menos trabalho eu determinar tarefas e trabalhos e prazos e os trabalhadores cumprirem com tudo o q lhes é exigido. mas são tão raros estes trabalhadores, que fazem td o q é esperado deles e q são capazes ainda de acrescentar algo que tu não estás a ver, que tu nem imaginas. são esses que indico sempre para promoção, cheio de pena por os ver partir da minha equipa. 

o problema é que a maior parte não quer saber do trabalho e se não andares em cima deles, fazem o mínimo indispensável e está bom. é pena que as pessoas não tenham bem noção disso quando olham para o pib português. mas, depois de tantos anos a gerir pessoas em pt, não tenho dúvidas que o trabalhador português podia ser mto melhor do que aquilo que é.

e se eu não andar em cima deles, sou eu que me fodo, que o meu contrato não é igual ao deles, que nunca são despedidos. é que eu tenho uma carta de rescisão por mútuo acordo assinada por mim desde o dia em que cheguei. é esta a espada que mtos de nós directores temos em cima da cabeça por isso se achas que me vou preocupar com um funcionário ir chateado para casa um dia ou não gostar de mim por causa de ter levado umas palavras tortas por trabalho que eu lhe pedi e ele não fez e que esse berro ou acção mais forte evita que, com o efeito dominó, a empresa demore mais um dia a entregar o produto final ao cliente e o culpado perante o PCA é o meu departamento, não perco um minuto de sono com isso.",cun3etr,t3_3j4omn,,0,t1_cun1yoz,t5_2qmie,0,1444109856,-1,-1,,,portugal,jupiter_rising1985,1441122638

1441131545,"&gt;Should I learn Castilian or Catalan?

Only learn Valencian/Catalan if you manage to master Spanish and love learning other languages, but in that case I would spend my time learning other European languages instead (French, German). You would need to learn some words though. For example road signs used to be bilingual Spanish/Valencian, but things started to change a few years ago and nowadays they are mostly only Valencian. In the city of Valencia all street signs are in Valencian. People will most certainly use the Spanish name when giving directions though. The word for street is ""carrer"", not ""calle"". Take a look at [this table](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Municipios_de_la_provincia_de_Valencia) and you will see that most names of towns in the province are the same or very similar in both languages, but some of them can be very different, especially for the untrained eye.

&gt;Should I even bother learning Spanish? I feel like I should.

You can survive in Valencia speaking English only as a tourist and not without difficulties. If you are going to live here (I'm in Valencia) you MUST learn Spanish.

&gt;Is shopping any different?

Taxes are **always** included (VAT is usually 21%, for some things it's 10%). What you see on the tag of an item is the final price you will pay, unless there is a special offer, in which case you will pay less, but never more.

The same goes for restaurants, cafeterias, etc. regarding taxes (VAT is 10%), and the staff won't be expecting a 15% or higher tip. Of course if you tip that amount they would gladly accept it, they will just think you are a dumb ""guiri"". You can tip even ZERO if you want, but it's always nice to tip at least a little bit.

&gt;Also I heard the unemployment over there for people under 25 is absolutely bananas.

Unfortunately not only under 25. You will be probably shocked by the amount of under 30 or even under 35 that live with their parents.

Feel free to ask more questions.

1441124986,"Herre fucking jesus min skapare, vad är det här för skit? Hur fan har den här kommentaren 98 röster?! Det här är helt 100% äkta rasbiologi, som tagen ur mitten av 1800 talet. Jag är jävligt försiktig med att kalla folk rasist, för att det känns som att varenda SDare som inte gillar invandring automatiskt blir det nuförtiden, men det här är legit definitionen av rasism, och du blir uppröstad till himlen.

Okej, så, du tror inte att västvärldens välstånd har någonting alls med Europas natur och geografi att göra? Inte alls relaterat till att det är en relativt liten kontinent med stor befolkning som lever i ett ställe med bördig jord, få riktigt ordentligt farliga djur, temperatur som inte hjälper, utan ofta dödar, sjukdomar? Ingenting att göra med att såhär stora befolkningar på så lite mark måste konkurrera med varandra och vara mer innovativa för att överleva? 

Du tror inte att fattigdomen och bristen på utveckling söder om sahara har någonting att göra med att terrängen är grov, både flora och fauna är livsfarliga (till och med för välutrustade grupper av jägare), dödliga sjukdomar finns i vattnet, djuren och insekterna, och att enorma landareor (afrika är flera gånger så stort som europa) + låg befolkningsökning före modern medicin ledde till låg konkurrens om mark, och därför lite behov för innovation? 

Du tror helt fullständigt 100% att om man tog vita europeer och dumpade dem i afrika så skulle de ändå på något sätt skapa ett välmående, teknologiskt avancerat samhälle som skulle åka till Europa och kolonisera hela kontinenten, eftersom de svarta (som i detta scenario byter plats med europeerna och förlfyttas till europa) bara krigade, våldtog, åt och sket i 4000 år, till skillnad från europeerna som använde sina överlägsna europeiska vita hjärnor för att hugga ner jungeln, göra jorden bördig nog för jordbruk på stor skala, utrota alla livsfarliga djurarter, utrota eller skydda sig mot de extremt dödliga microorganismerna som finns i jorden, vattnet, myggorna, djuren och en massa annat skit?

Jag kan inte förstå hur man bara kan stänga av sin hjärna detta sätt. Förstår inte hur man kan skita fullständigt i att göra lite research, lära sig lite forntidshistoria osv och istället bara sikta in sig 100% på rasbiologi för att vissa raser är lite bättre på att springa eller har lite större kuk än andra. 

Sen har kultur också en ganska så stor effekt på hur ett samhälle utvecklas, men då har det inte mycket med ras att göra. En helsvart blåneger från mörkaste afrika kan, med möda och tid, absorbera västerländska värderingar.

You misunderstand me,  I'm not talking about 'what truly happened', but simply about the fact that there are two separate views expressed on the matter by Armenia and Turkey. To say that there are no two points of view, would be to ignore everything what Turkey has said on the matter for the past century. I'm not talking about who is right or wrong, but only about that fact that there are different views on the matter (regardless of the historical accuracy).

And the reason I mention this is for the simple reason that through it, you'd at least get a motive for a different view being expressed in the history books (if there was one).

But in the case of Ataturk's reforms, that is not the case. There is not another legitimate party who disputes what truly happened. Even if you were to look at the statistics, be it the decrease in illiteracy or the introduction of civil rights, you'd be able to see the success of his reforms. Yet it said that his reforms were not as successful and they hardly mention a large portion of it.

Without another legitimate party disputing the events that happened, a distorted view is presented lacking any motive for this distortion or whatsoever. I don't know whether this was because of the incompetence of the author or whether there was truly some agenda at play. Ever since the AKP, anti-Turkish sentiment has been on the rise in Western-Europe, perhaps that's the reason?

Population of England: 53.9 million   

Population of Wales: 3.1 million

Total square miles policed: 50,337 square miles (England); 8,018 square miles (Wales)
Source: [Encyclopedia of the Nations-Europe-United Kingdom](http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/United-Kingdom.html) 

A politician quoting a partisan survey doesn't change the fact that there will only be 100,000 officers to police 57 million people over 
roughly 60 thousand square miles.

This will be accomplished, according to the article, by cutting community and proactive policing, no longer responding to burglaries and shoplifting complaints, and expecting citizens to respond to residential crimes on their own.

How can this be, when crime is falling, according to the government?

Let's look more closely at those statistics.  According to the ""Crime Statistics at Gov.UK"", 

""In April 2013, the new outcomes framework was 
introduced and subsequently there has been a 
change to the way in which crime outcomes statisti
cs are presented. Provisional statistics from the 
new outcomes framework were first presented in the 2013/14 bulletin
1, published in July 2014. Since 
then we have developed the statistics further, and co
nsulted with data providers (police forces) and 
users of the statistics. Prior to April 2013, official
 statistics about how crimes were dealt with by the 
police were narrowly focused on detections (i.e. the nu
mber of cases resolved with a charge, caution, 
etc.).  
We continue to ensure that these crime outcomes
 statistics: meet identified user needs (including 
providing new analysis and greater transparency);
 are well explained and readily accessible; are 
produced according to sound methods; and are ma
naged impartially and objectively in the public 
interest.  
The statistics presented in this bulletin are designated as Official Statistics, rather than National 
Statistics.  
In January 2014, police recorded crime statistics 
were found not to meet the required standard for 
designation as National Statistics. The full assessmen
t report against the Code of Practice for Official 
Statistics can be found on the UK 
Statistics Authority website:...""

In other words, the data doesn't say what the Tories want it to say, so they're going to fiddle with the way the statistics are calculated.

There are ""Lies, Damned lies, and Statistics"", according to Mark Twain.  I hope the Tories choke on theirs, but that seems unlikely before they drive England completely down the black hole.

1441128636,"&gt; &gt; On average, every 43 seconds, one unborn human (most of the time a minority) is killed in the US by a doctor.

&gt; If the doctor were entering the womb and killing the fetus without the mother's permission as you seem to imply, you might have been making a point there. But that's not true, is it?

The fetus/embryo was alive, but now isn't because of the direct and intentional action of the doctor, ie killed.  The fact that the mother consented or the manner in which the child was killed is unimportant; there is still a net loss of one human life.

&gt; I'm not just talking about the US troops. When you invade a country, people who are in that country tend to die as well, more so than the troops who are invading. If you add those up, they quickly outnumber your figure of 58 million. I mean, the American Indian Wars alone killed tens of millions of natives. And these are full human beings, not fetuses who were removed in unwanted or dangerous pregnancies.

For many years the estimated civilian casualty ratio was 90%.  Using that number, the total US casualty count, including civilians, rises to 30 million.  Still less than 58,000,000.  In fact, the 90% number has recently been debunked, and 50% is a more accurate number (putting us at 6 million.)

The US Census Bureau estimates about 45,000 Indians died in the American Indian Wars.  As for the Trail of Tears, slightly more than 46,000 were moved, so the death toll is going to be significantly less than that.  This does not even break 100,000, let alone tens of millions.  Not to diminish the tragedy of it, but the deaths from small pox and other illnesses brought from Europe don't really count since the settlers had no idea that it would effect the natives so.

However, you are correct.  If we somehow counted every single death caused, funded, or involved with the US, it would surely be much more than 58 mil.  But the fact is that abortion deaths still outnumber police and military casualties put together.

&gt; The problem with that is life is continuous. If you consider zygotes human beings then you also have to consider eggs and sperms as human beings, in which case we'd have to outlaw sexual intercourse since many sperms die during that. So where does it end?

I agree.  Your liver is alive too, and we can agree that it is not a human.  But a zygote will become a human under natural circumstances, and your liver won't.

You are correct, life is continuous.  You also said that you oppose abortion after 28-30 weeks. What happens at the moment the baby turns 29 weeks old that gives it the right to life?  We can never know exactly when a fetus feels pain/is viable/etc..  In fact, it is not a sudden change, but a gradual one.  How can you measure something as important as the life or death of a human with an error range of 336 hours?

False,"***This is the email I just sent to Mr. Turner. TL;DR in bold***

***Dear Mr. Turner,***

My name is (bunnylover726) and I am a materials scientist and engineer living in Ohio's tenth district. ***I am writing today regarding your fight to keep North America's tallest peak named Mt. McKinley.*** 

I was raised in Ohio, and my father is Ohio born and Ohio raised- when I was in primary school, he taught me that the mountain is called ""Denali"" because when he visited it himself, that's what everybody in Alaska called it. (My father's hobby is photography and he enjoys climbing and taking photos of mountains). So I grew up with large photos of that peak hanging in my home, and we called it Denali.

It was never meant as a sign of disrespect to President McKinley- I grew up literally a stone's throw away from the home of President James A. Garfield (in Mentor, Ohio), and my mother is a huge American history buff. We learned about all the presidents (including visits to Independence Hall, Valley Forge, Gettysburg, Mount Vernon, the McKinley National Memorial, and the list goes on). My siblings and I studied the things those great men have done for our nation, both in and out of school. 

***As an engineer, someone who deals with numbers and logic, I just fail to see how it's logical to fight to keep the name of a president from Ohio on a mountain from Alaska.*** It's not just an issue of the ideas of native peoples vs. people of European descent who settled this country- I have caucasian friends from Alaska who think that the issue is silly and that it should just be called ""Denali"".

I think the better way to honor President McKinley's legacy would be to let the name of the mountain go back to ""Denali"" as a gesture of good faith to the people of Alaska. ***I did some research and found that McKinley wanted a monument to honor American soldiers and sailors from Stark County, Ohio.*** On the site he recommended is where the McKinley National Memorial now stands. 

It would make a lot more sense in my opinion to spend our time and effort to donate resources to the McKinley National Memorial. Or maybe to help fund or have volunteers show up at Ohio elementary schools as a William McKinley re-enactor to teach the next generation about his contributions. Or, keeping with the spirit of McKinley's wanting a memorial for Stark County veterans, make sure that there is at least one memorial for veterans in all 88 of Ohio's counties. 

Maybe that effort could be used to teach young people to honor veterans in other ways too? My mother works at a nursing home in Northeastern Ohio full of brave men whose stories will be lost when they pass on. Wouldn't it be great to encourage young people to interview and take video of the brave men from our state who risked everything for our freedoms, and preserve it for future generations? When I was in Junior High, some High School age boys went to the local nursing home, listened to the stories of veterans, and got enough stories and information to become World War II re-enactors. They visited the schools in my town with the stories that they had learned about people from our own state, and it really gave us a new appreciation for the sacrifices that have been made for our freedoms. Those sorts of efforts should be rewarded, and I think President McKinley would approve.

***(TL;DR McKinley was big on honoring veterans and never mentioned mountains in Alaska, so why don't you spend your effort honoring veterans like he specifically asked us to?)***

***I was thinking we should stick President McKinley's name on something from Ohio- how about using the publicity to make a small college scholarship fund for a student that learns a lot about him?*** A scholarship for a future history teacher that will continue teaching generations about him and continuing his legacy? That would work to keep young people like myself aware of his accomplishments.

***While I understand that your fight to keep a great Ohioan's name on an international landmark is full of the best intentions, I hope you understand that I just think that the effort could be redirected to better preserve McKinley's legacy in other ways.***

Thank you for your time and attention, and thank you for your continued efforts to make our nation a better place. 

Very Sincerely Yours,

(Bunnylover726)

&gt;L'ennui. Et personne ne me croie quand je raconte que je m'ennuyais à l'école.

C'est parce que les gens se méprennent sur la source de ton ennui. Ils pensent que tu t'ennuyais parce que le contenu était bien en dessous de ton level, alors qu'en fait c'est parce que les méthodes employées par l'éducation nationale sont à la ramasse (ou en tout cas pas adaptées à tout le monde). 

Je vois 2 facteurs à ça : 
1- les profs sont chiants. Ils ne font pas vivre leur cours. Ils font leurs heures et s'en foutent. Et ça se ressent beaucoup. J'ai eu quelques profs passionnés par leur matière, et ils ont su me la communiquer. Mais ils sont malheureusement trop rares.
2- l'enseignement par la théorie c'est naze. J'ai rien appris à l'école parce que c'était beaucoup trop abstrait. J'ai appris à écrire non pas en sachant que ""le complément d'objet direct subit l'action accomplie par le sujet"", mais en lisant des livres. Et pareil pour tout le reste. J'ai arrêté l'école républicaine en 4e Techno, puis je suis monté à Bac+4 grâce à la formation professionnelle pour adulte, beaucoup plus orientée pratique que théorique.

&gt;J'ai pas d'autre perspective pour l'instant, alors va falloir serrer les dents et essayer que ça passe.

The deal is awful for so many reasons. Nukes aside, Iran is a major state sponsor of terrorism. They directly fund and train the likes of Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis, and more lesser known groups. With this deal, billions in assets will be unfrozen, and even the most ardent supporters of the deal understand that a lot of that money will end up in the hands of terrorists and Iran's proxies. Who will benefit from the deal? The Iranian elite and multinational corporations. Europe and the US's businesses are itching to get into Iran and start making money. Considering the money at stake here, it's no surprise that Iran is lobbying hard to get this passed. Everyone talks about the money from the Israel lobby (why wouldn't Israelis be dead against this? The groups who chant death to Israel are about to become much richer), but what isn't being publicized is how much money the Iranian lobbyists are pouring into this.

Not to mention other details, like how we couldn't even get our imprisoned journalists released. The waiting period is laughable. *We're going to let the Iranians monitor themselves in some instances.* I mean what a joke. All they have to do is wait 10-15 years and the bomb is theirs.

I think the Allies would start dropping the bomb almost immediately in this scenario.  One of their big motivators was to prevent the loss of allied life, so as soon as it was game on, they're dropping on Moscow and whatever other big cities are left in the USSR in order to prevent the massacre of their armies in Europe.  

The need is immediate in this scenario, and conventional warfare trashes cities just as much as the atom bombs do, so the Allied High Command does some quick math and goes all in immediately.  The question is, do they drop in Germany to destroy army units or hope that they surrender when their cities back home are destroyed?

1441131951,"If you want to surrender all power to the government and the people they supply with guns, then that is where I truly take issue.  I do believe that an armed citizenry is an actual ""check"" to the checks and balances of how our government acts.  It's an insurance policy that the founders wrote into the constitution because they understood what it meant to take up arms against a non-legitimate authority.  That's ultimately the most basic reason for having guns in the hands of the public in my opinion and why it should it always remain a constitutional right.

If you want to surrender that right, there are plenty of developed nations who have disarmed their citizens and conceded local authority to supra-national powers (like the EU).  America has always been against that kind of intergration until Pres. Obama sat as the presiding chair of the UN.  Understand, that to the informed, that is a very dangerous precedent as it is a violation of his oath as President as written in the constitution.  We know they have an agenda to take guns away from us, and it's not because they want to end mass shooters.

1441707274,"Mr Deputy Speaker,
While this bill was submitted by my own party leader, I can expect that it will not receive much support from our MPs, since it flies directly in the face of one of our most crucial policies, which I might add attracts many voters to our party, which is that we want to take control of our borders. The reason for many of our members support for the party is because of the opposition to free movement between EU countries, so how can we claim to represent our constituents without voting 'nay' on this bill, which opens up the floodgates to even more people who can enter without so much as a glance at their criminal history or qualifications?

However, I'm sure that many other parties in the house will support these measures, and to them I might say, why? What good will this bill do for our country, any migrant from Australia, Canada or New Zealand that we have need of, who possesses skills that we otherwise lack, would be allowed into the country under our current system. The only people who this bill would allow into the country that cannot already get  in, are not individuals that we as a society or a nation have any need of, unskilled and unqualified workers looking to leech of off our overly generous welfare system, if you deny this then you admit that the bill is useless.

If this is not yet enough to prompt your opposition to this bill, I might add that it is a xenophobic bill, what God-given right do the people of these three countries have to come to our country, that other countries do not also have? Is it a common culture? If so then surely we should allow free movement with the United States who also have a very similar culture to us. Is it that these countries were once part of the empire and are currently members of the commonwealth? If so then why does this bill not extend the same rights to India or South Africa, or any other former colonies or Commonwealth members?

All-in-all, there is no way to paint this bill into a positive light, depending on your viewpoint it is either unnecessary or racist, and I implore members from each corner of the house to oppose this bill.

1441131993,"I'll have to disagree with the we can't help Africa and the middle east part.  Lets take Somalia for example.  For two decades, the outside world tried to help but failed every time.  Now, things are completely different thanks Turkish Aid.  The prime minister went there himself reassuring the rest of the aid donors that Mogadishu is not as bad as its said to be.  Then, unlike Donors like the EU and US, they actually went their building one of the largest and best hospitals in East Africa, roads schools.  Brought teachers and Turkish engineers and thankfully things are looking up in Somalia for the first time in over two decades.  The way Western Aid works is that, one it takes way to long for those promises to turn into aid.  After that it goes to NGO's with ridiculous salaries and overhead.  Some more of the money goes into logistics, security and dealing with local leaders who expect their  palms to be greased.  By the time it reaches the intended target, there is little to show for it on the ground and you have angry donors wondering where there aid is going.  So, yes we can help Africa in many way.  my suggestion would be to one, switch from the old ways of Aid and look more towards the Turkish and Chinese models.  Second, we can perhaps forgive their debt so that scarce local resource can go to education, healthcare, job creation... Third, we should perhaps assist African nations like Gabon whose resource are being exploited by companies who are not abiding by the terms of their agreements.  Perhaps we can lower tariffs and end subsidies so that African producers can better compete in Western Markets because contrary to popular beliefs, Africa has some of the fastest growing economies.  As for the political Side, dealing with corruption and bad African leaders, maybe we can create competition for better governance by rewarding the good ones.  Ethiopia comes to mind but am sure there are others.  Do western nations have to do this, no.  Should they, yes.  If not out of morality then to deal with the topic at hand of migrants because its very difficult to deter someone who is willing to risk their life and that of their family by hoping on a dingy boat where thousands before them lost their lives in the bottom of the Mediterranean sea in hope of a better future.

False,"I would say there seems to be a big difference with how the immigration is handled in Europe and in America. I think in America there is a much greater pressure to actually integrate into the society. You have to do most of the work yourself if you want to get somewhere and that means not shutting yourself inside and living as you've always lived.

In Europe (Sweden in my case) immigrants don't have as much pressure on them, and will get welfare money and healthcare without much hassle and pressure and they are treated much more as victims (which in many cases they surely are).

I don't think this gives as much incentive to actually integrate properly and try new things. We have over the years seen an increasing problem in migrant heavy (majority muslim, it has to be said) suburbs of larger Swedish cities, where homosexuals have been getting a hard time. Women have also been harassed for things such as, but not limited to not ""dressing properly"" and being out alone. Jews have also been targeted. This problem will continue to grow, because there is not much room to put migrants except in these suburbs, and since the job and housing situation is very bad as of now they will stay there, as will the culture and the unwanted elements that the culture holds. Basically nothing is being done about it.

One of the reasons might also be that it is expensive to cross the Atlantic Ocean, whereas getting from say, North Africa or the Middle East to Europe is relatively cheap. This means the more poor, uneducated people come to Europe, while the richer, more moderate people can continue to America.

&gt; no they didn't all leave their families behind despicably

1441135815,"Thanks for the info, I'll take a look!

This is one of the reasons I REALLY like population decline. While the total population decline in European countries is small or nonexistent, there's a drastic reduction from one generation to the next that has yet to be reflected in the total population count. You see, global warming isn't the only problem. We're stretching so many things, even just sand can be said to be running out because it's used in everything, so much so that now there's sand thieves in Asia that steal sand from beaches to sell. 

I don't think anyone could argue that in 100 years when technology in the intelligence, automation sector has really risen that we wouldn't all be better off with fewer people so that it's harder to hit these kinds of troubles where the population stretches the resources, or capacity of the earth.

This population reduction from one generation to the next is taking place in most all countries except Africa. Even India's fertility rate is almost at replacement rate! 

One of the things we need to figure out is how to produce electricity in a renewable way. Strangely enough, if we figure this out we'll probably use the method for thousands of years. This I argue is not solar or wind power but fusion power. There's a ton of startups tackling it, China is pushing for a fusion solution with huge effort, Europe is hosting ITER which does not have a very lofty goal, but does allow us to test all kinds of technologies that is used in the project. I think using something like solar power to power the world for billions of people is really stretching it and I think we'd be better of focusing on getting fusion power to work.

In conclusion while others are really bothered with the future population decline and the temporary effects it will have on the older members of society, I masturbate furiously over the newest fertility stats, seeing them as one of the great solutions to the massive consumption demands each member of the western world demands, which is one of the reasons why global warming exists. Unfortunately Africa is set to wipe out all of that population reduction progress, we really need to focus on reducing their fertility rates.

Edit: For fun I will also mention that I plan to be one of the people to 'implement' this solution by not having children myself or in the absolute 'worst' case scenario, by having only one.

I'm from the North-West, which has a fairly large immigrant population (compared to a lot of the country).

In my experience (anecdotal and from reading up) immigration of unskilled persons generally hurt an economy / society, especially if these people are claiming to be 'refugee's' like a lot of those coming from the Middle East.

Britain's benefit system is one of the worst / best in Europe. The show 'Benefit Street', not an exaggeration. I've known so many people, and stopped talking to a lot of friends because they were abusing the benefits system (I'm talking about people living on the dole, not looking for work for multiple months and years) and living better than those of us who actually work.

This makes Britain and the UK a very popular choice for people seeking to immigrate 'for a better life'. The problem is that our governments (all of them) use this as great propaganda, they won't reduce benefits because such a large portion of the population use them in some way (every single parent, single or coupled, regardless of choices receive Child Benefits for example) and that would damage their chances for election, but they can still point at the immigrants to distract the populous from actual issues. The whole Calais issue could be resolved within a month if they actually wanted to fix it (provide France with UK border controller / Police staff to aid with the expulsion of camps). The fact that the government won't crack down on these immigrants (and encourages labelling them as refuges) just encourages more of them to come here.

From a societal point if view, large numbers of immigrants tend to create their own culture, at the expulsion of the local one. Almost every person I've met around my age that identifies themselves as 'Asian' (which is incredibly Racist in of itself) or Pakistani are British. They were born, and raised in Britain. As were their parents and grandparents. Most have never even been to Pakistan, yet they still refuse to integrate into the local culture.

False,"I never had any issue dealing with insurance, nor any negative experiences involving family members. My mother has Lupus, and never once had to fight to get anything covered. In fact several times they'd add in extra things like a bone stimulator to speed a broken bone recovery.  Unfortunately plans like that, where they are easy to use are under attack by the new legislation put forth under democratic leadership. Rather than trying to get lift other plans to that level, it penalizes companies that opt to take care of their workers. Which goes back to my whole point about the DNC constantly trying to punish even moderately successful people, trying to hold them down in a lower class standard of living.  

&gt; Colombia has a dual system. You can get close to free public healthcare but I pay extra for private services so that if I get hospitalized I get my own private room. Still way cheaper than the US but I think it's about $50 a month plus $8 each time you visit the doctor. If you're poor here though it only costs you 50 cents per visit. Overall their healthcare system is rated higher than the US even here. I think the main difference is that there's paint peeling off the walls when you go to the hospital but the service is really good.

I don't think you can really compare Columbia to the US in terms of costs. Average salary in that country is less than $10k a year. 

&gt;Oh and and as far as wait times and all that. I have never experienced that for anything. MRI's, catscans, etc. Never had to wait.

I have a friend in N. Ireland who had to wait 2 weeks to get a CAT scan, and opted to go the private route. My other friend from Canada had to wait 3 months to see a specialist. Here I had a compacted eardrum and had the ear specialist scheduled for the next day before leaving the doctors office. 

I will agree with you that the litigious nature of our health system is a huge drain on resources and a big contributor to small time practices costs. But when your congress is ran by trial lawyers don't expect that to change.

Seems you paid 6 - 8% of your potential take home.

Spaced armor means that there are 2 sheets of steel there. Some ammo types (HEAT and HE) can only penetrate one.

They meant tier 8 premiums. Get one when you feel fairly comfortable playing on that tier.

&gt; And about mods? I'm using XVM and BattleAssistant. What are other 'core' mods? Which ones are illegal and could me get banned?

Aslain has a nice installer which informs you if the mod is legal on NA or other servers. But as you're playing on EU - everything is allowed, because WG EU doesn't give a shit.

&gt; How do I decide when to use HE ammo or regular AP ammo? I know HE has less pen but I feel like it always does damage, even when it doesn't penetrate. So why should I ever use the AP ammo?

Yes, HE always does damage, but without penetration it's AT MOST half of the damage stated. Overall you will lose a lot of DPM. It's better to just learn tank weakspots so you can always penetrate with AP. HE is useful against tanks with thin armor, but that comes into play later in the game.",cuncw71,t3_3j9adv,,0,t3_3j9adv,t5_2s113,0,1444114389,5,5,,,WorldofTanks,FeniEnt,1441136947

UK is the biggest importer of American craft beer.  

On the continent, Mikkeller, who is also kind of a big deal, cites American brewers as an inspiration.  Actual quote from Mikkeller:  

&gt;“We think all the best breweries are in the U.S. We copy a lot of things from you. We almost only use American hops, we use barrel-aging, and our bar in Copenhagen looks somewhat like an American beer bar.”  

And from another article:

&gt;[“There’s huge respect for what American brewing has achieved,” says Will Hawkes, the current British Beer Writer of the Year. “People want that American hop flavor and they want breweries that are not afraid to experiment.” It used to be that American craft brewers took cues from Belgium, Britain, and Germany. Now the industry has come full circle, and breweries worldwide are looking to the U.S. beer scene for inspiration. In New Zealand, 8 Wired specializes in highly bittered beers, and Australia’s Feral Brewing utilizes U.S.-grown hops in its IPAs. Italy’s Birrificio Toccalmatto produces hop-driven beers like the lemony Zona Cesarini IPA, and you can’t throw a stone in Scandinavia without hitting IPA-crazed brewers such as Denmark’s To Øl, Norway’s Nøgne Ø, or Sweden’s Omnipollo. As for Britain, says Hawkes, “some of the top breweries, like Siren and Moor, are run by Americans, while others, like Magic Rock and BrewDog, can seem like American breweries that just happen to be in the U.K.”](http://www.bonappetit.com/drinks/beer/article/american-beer-europe)  

Also, love the 'I've had European beer that's so much better than the best American beers!'.  Try some more American beer then.

Daily. It's my most visited sub and for good reason.

Spain at the moment, pursuing my education.

Yes. I am fluent in Serbian and nearly in Spanish. I can basically understand all dialects of Serbo-Croatian too, if that counts. 

* What interests you about Europe?

The culture we have created in general, how developed we are, and how we cooperate with each other ^^^for ^^^the ^^^ most ^^^part. 

* What are your favourite and least favourite things about /r/europe?

My favorite thing about /r/Europe? The threads about sharing our culture, whether it be music or popular tourist destinations. My least favorite thing has got to be the brigades and lack of filters. 

* Do you have experience as a moderator or similar?

Nope! I'm a newbie. I have done so on video games, but I'm guessing that doesn't count ;( 

* Why do you want to be a moderator?

Many users are dissatisfied with the management of this sub in general and I'd like to advocate for changes the user-base of this sub demands. 

*why do you think you would be a good moderator?

I care about this sub. I've put made so many comments and gotten so much karma that I don't want to see it go to shit.

I've done polls before for trivial things but other than that, no.

* What do you think went wrong (if anything)?

The sub was in general uninterested in conversing with one another in such a format. It shoved everything off into one corner and confined discussion to comment threads instead of link submissions. What would have been possibly hundreds of comments on an article turned into just a couple. At times the last submission would have been from four hours ago. 

Good temporary fix, bad long-term solution. I hope the state of this sub is temporary too, until we get filters implemented (and possibly not just for immigration issues).

I am trying to understand your criteria by which you would select countries to choose to pursue an open borders treaty with. Your initial answers suggested that your complaints are mostly economic in nature.

&gt;Out of 1.2 billion people living in India, I think quite a lot of them would settle the UK to better their life if given the chance. Even middle class people in India probably have much lower living standards than their counterparts here.

What evidence do you have to suggest that 'earth-shattering' numbers would migrate in the first place? Beyond that, what exactly constitutes 'earth-shattering'?

&gt;This horrific debate started with you asking me why we shouldn't have open borders with India. I mean, are you actually in favour of that? The status quo is that we do not have open borders with India, I shouldn't have to defend the status quo anyway, the burden of evidence is on whoever wishes to change it.

Well I mean, in the long term i'm in favour of a zero border global society. This would probably entail some sort of accountable world government with power decentralised down as far as possible, even to a local or individual level. I'm not saying you're wrong to suggest that open borders with India would probably be a bad route to take right this second - i'm not stupid, I understand that India, by and large, has worse living conditions than we do, and I understand that a massive movement of individuals in a very short amount of time is not sustainable (although I will note that our intake in the EU does not even approach that level at the moment).

My primary objection is that UKIP (which you are a member of IRL?) in general want to turn their backs on the EU in favour of better trade relations with the Commonwealth - which, it turns out, usually actually means 'the Anglosphere', but saying 'the Commonwealth' sells better. It also entails fabricating weak excuses for why the Anglosphere specifically is deemed 'good enough' for UK relations (especially since trade relations with Australia to replace European trade relations is laughable), and why countries better than even our own, like Singapore, are ignored.

False,"I think the core of our disagreement is how we are defining ""letting them keep the money"". Living isn't cheap, and the rich tend to live even more lavishly, and a lucky rich person without a source of income will lose a fortune without the government doing anything through spending. And the fortune will be split between the people who cook his food, design and construct his cars and house and what not. Hard workers who I think people of all political persuasions agree should get it. 

A rich person who stays rich still needs a source of income. That means they have to contribute to society, in a way that people continue voluntarily giving them money. Are there rich Americans who had rich slave owning ancestors or wealth stemming from European nobility? Without a doubt. But there are countless more poor Americans who can also trace a portion of their family to rich folks who squandered it. 

So to answer your question - aside from property rights why do the rich ""deserve"" to keep their money? Because the two options given to them are 1) gradually give their money to the hard workers allowing them to maintain their life style. 2) find a way to contribute to the economy that helps everyone in the USA.

My question to you is why do you think you (and the government) have the rights to take money from someone based on how much they aquired?

False,"Man, this is some hot nonsense. Let's begin, shall we?

&gt;Piglet was an import people wanted to see fail to protect some sort of NA mystique. From camping bot constantly in solo q to, casters. 

I have no idea about solo queue, but plenty of people wanted to see him succeed in NA. And the casters didn't want to see him fail. Sure, they talked a lot about his poor performances when he first showed up, but they did that because *that's their fucking job*, not because of some pro-NA conspiracy. A former world champion comes to NA and then (at least at the start) fails to live up to the hype? *Of course* that's going to be a major storyline the casters discuss a lot. 

&gt; it started with LMQ who received countless harassment also when they would go into solo q because they were an all Chinese team.

Everyone gets harassed in soloqueue. But the idea that LMQ were disliked for being a Chinese team is bullshit. Go back to last year and look at threads about them; they were beloved among NA fans. More popular than many of the all-NA teams, in fact...

&gt;Imagine how baseball or Soccer or Hockey would look if we only allowed one or two players to be from abroad. 

You realize that virtually every soccer league on the planet has this exact same rule, right? For example, let's just look at the English Premier League, which is probably the most popular single sports league on earth. Every Premier League team *has* to have at least eight home-grown players (players who came up in England through the English football system) to ensure that England continues to produce talented players and isn't totally overrun with foreign talent. 

Other leagues don't have this rule, but that's because it isn't a problem. The NHL, for example, [is and has always been](http://www.quanthockey.com/TS/TS_PlayerNationalities.php) like 80% or more people from NA. Or take the MLB, where [about 70%+  of the players are American](http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/7779279/percentage-foreign-major-league-baseball-players-rises). Those are both *higher* percentages of NA players than what Riot's rule requires. 

&gt;What happened with Rush, Impact, and Piglet is they were brought into a system not to win but to look good on paper.

First of all, you have absolutely no evidence for this statement. Also, it makes no sense. Why? What benefit does ""looking good on paper"" bring to anyone? It's not like these teams are selling tickets to their games, and the name ""Piglet"" puts butts in seats. Having a team that ""looks good on paper"" under the current LCS system is pretty pointless. Performance is what brings in the highest-paying sponsorships, and what keeps fans following your team. Getting a name like Piglet is attention-grabbing, but not in any way that's profitable for a team owner unless he *also* can perform well. 

&gt;EU handled their Imported players far better, and I didn't watch many of the VODs. Far less snide comments from fans and casters alike.

You're confusing snide and critical here. NA casters (and fans) were critical of Piglet because he performed poorly. EU fans and casters weren't critical about Huni and Reignover because they were stomping other teams off the face of the goddamn earth. (There was plenty of criticism for Ryu when he got off to kind of a rough start, though. And there was a LOT of rage when the new Fnatic roster was first announced. Nobody liked it until they saw Huni start beasting people.)

It's all about performance. Players who are performing well will get a free pass even when they make mistakes, players who are performing poorly will get criticized. It's part of the territory, and it happens to players of all nationalities. 

Now, MAYBE you could make an argument about how TL's team structure wasn't set up to best support Piglet and Fenix or something. But you haven't made that argument. Nor do you really have any knowledge about how their system works, unless you work for TL.

False,"&gt;I am trying to understand your criteria by which you would select countries to choose to pursue an open borders treaty with. Your initial answers suggested that your complaints are mostly economic in nature.

I don't really want open borders with any country. It's a bad idea in general in my opinion, you should always have at least some degree of control. A country can have de facto free movement just by increasing the amount let in if it wants, that's better than just opening the borders fully.

&gt;What evidence do you have to suggest that 'earth-shattering' numbers would migrate in the first place?

The experience of the EU free movement is a sign. We opened the borders with Poland and we saw one-sided mass immigration. Now take Poland, increase its population by about 30 times and reduce the living standards significantly. The migration between that and the UK would be unprecedented and huge. Well, the migration we got from the EU was unprecedented and huge, I can't think of any more words to describe what it would be between us and India.

&gt;Beyond that, what exactly constitutes 'earth-shattering'?

We used to have between 30,000 and 50,000 net migration per year. That was fine, and considered normal. Now it's 300,000+ per year, and the majority of the public are totally against that and want it lowered. 300,000 is massive and far too much. Through open borders with India, we'd see something even bigger than that, maybe even up to 1 million. That would be earth-shattering.

&gt;(which you are a member of IRL?)

No, I'm not. I don't support UKIP as much as you think. I just broadly agree with their key message - that of leaving the EU and reducing net immigration. As well as many other policies they have. After the general election I like them even less - they turned into an electoral reform pressure group rather than a serious political party.

Anyway, I also know that their message of closer ties with the Commonwealth rather than Europe was just rhetoric really, there was no serious policy or thought behind that.

I know it may seem simplistic, but people tend to ignore small countries. You can't even see Singapore on the map.

&gt; Between 2009 and 2011, RBS made ""capital contributions"" totalling €9.13bn (£7.6bn) to its Dublin-headquartered subsidiary Ulster Bank Ireland. Over the same period, Lloyds transferred £6.41bn to its Irish operation, Bank of Scotland (Ireland), before dissolving the business.
The total – £14bn – amounts to more than a fifth of the £65bn UK taxpayers injected into RBS and Lloyds in 2008 and 2009, and is expected to rise further. Analysts estimate that RBS transferred another £2bn last year.
RBS and Lloyds used the funds to write off billions of pounds of debt loaned to Irish commercial property developers and households in the ""Celtic Tiger"" boom years.

&gt; The UK has offered to make a direct bilateral loan to the Irish Republic. Its total contribution is expected to be about 8bn euros.
The UK is to initially contribute an estimated 3.8bn euros in a direct loan for the banks.
The rest will come from its contributions to the IMF and the European Union's Financial Stability Mechanism.
Chancellor George Osborne said: ""It is in Britain's national interest. It is money we fully expect to get back, and we think it will help Ireland get on a fully stable path back to growth.""
Tough times in the Irish Republic would mean less demand for UK goods and services from one of the UK's largest trading partners.
According to UK government figures, trade with the country exceeds total UK trade with Brazil, Russia, India and China.
Also, many of the UK's banks have large exposures to the Irish economy.

&gt;Now the crisis of the West is ongoing, and everybody knows what it is. In the circumstances of the United States—I’ve only ever been here twice—the prognosis for decay is well-advanced. The people who created the United States are on the defensive: they’re on the defensive psychologically, and emotionally, and linguistically, and culturally. People are comfortable, at least those that are, and a lot hit by recession, but everyone is worried about what the future will hold. Demographically, the people in this room could well be a minority in 40 years, maybe less than 40 years, maybe more than 40 years; maybe it doesn’t matter if it’s 40 years or 44 or 64 or 35.

&gt;What matters is that you’ve become a minority now. You’ve become a minority mentally, because these things happen to people mentally and psycho-spiritually before they have a physical impact. I think people are preparing to be a minority now, long before it happens. I was well aware that President Bill Clinton was once asked about his commitment to political correctness, and he said whites need political correctness. He said white Europeans, white Americans need it because they’re going to be a minority relatively soon, and you need to play all of those vanguard games whereby you play off each group against every other group, you make sure that your protest is in early whenever you’re insulted, or you feel there’s the prospect that you might be insulted

So many good quotes from this talk. 

&gt;If people think that the circumstances of American life are ill-disposed to your future identity now, what’s it going to be like in 50 years? What’s it going to be like in 150 years? In 150 years white Americans could be maybe 20% of the population. This is the future that faces you. And your culture will be disprivileged. Forget political correctness. Political correctness works when minorities aggregate together in a vanguard way. It doesn’t work when majorities fall and stagger into minority status and then look around for allies now that they are themselves a minority in the hope that somehow they will achieve fairness and equity. Because these things are not about fairness and equity. They are about who can set the standard and the tone for the cultural domination of a civic space. And if it’s not the white identity in the United States—if it’s not post-Europeanism in the USA—it will be other forms of identity. Some of them fractured, broken-down, mixed, and otherwise marginal.


More good stuff. 
  
&gt;Political correctness is a methodology and a grammar. It is designed to restrict the prospect of a thought before the thought is even enunciated. Chairman Mao had the idea of “magic words.” Magic words. “Racism” is a magic word. Use it, and people fall apart. People begin to disengage even from their own desire to defend themselves. All of the other “–isms”: sexism, disableism, classism, ageism, homophobia, Islamaphobia, all the others are pale reflections, in other and slightly less crucial areas, of the original one: “racism.”

&gt;“Racism” is a term developed by Leon Trotsky in an article in the Left oppositionist journal in the Soviet Union in 1926 or 1927. It is now universalized from its dissentient communist origins—don’t forget Trotsky was on the way out of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as Stalin engineered his disposal and the disposal the Left opposition that he led—and that word has been extracted now to such a degree that it is a universal. It’s universal, it’s become a moral lexicon of engagement and disengagement. If you wish to condemn somebody in contemporary discourse, you say that they are a racist. And there’s a degree to which nobody can refute what you’re saying in the present dispensation.",cung1w4,t3_3j9n9f,,0,t3_3j9n9f,t5_2u7i2,0,1444115877,1,1,,,european,Billfoy,1441141728

Now, ALL cultures around the world don't like people who come to their society and misbehave.  You don't go to Saudi Arabia and try to open a bar and go apeshit when you are told that's offensive.  You don't go to Israel and try to hold a barbeque and riot when they find that offensive.

So why on earth is it suddenly OK when folks from Islamic countries come to Europe or America and get upset when we're not so happy with the violence and backwardness.  In another context, THEY would be considered the offensive ones.  But no......in Opposite Land (liberal white culture) its actually the host society that is wrong.

What I think is important is making the connection with the unconscious parts of the psyche as a means to increase experience in the world. I don't seriously believe we are heading toward a Pagan culture at all. Paganism incorporates a whole functioning society really. But, that doesn't mean you ought not learn about the unconscious and read about the myths. The myths are not literal stories, they resonate on an unconscious level as metaphor and personifications. Understanding the myths and the psyche changes personal experience and improves health. I am 100% certain of that.

Joseph Campbell writes about these things so you could try some of his books if you're interested. He edited the Portable Jung too. But I would read Campbell before you read Jung.

http://www.amazon.com/The-Portable-Jung-Library/dp/0140150706

After you read Jung you can analyse your dreams. That is something I believe is really important, you get direct access to your unconscious and learn things about yourself that increase development and wisdom.

Well, we are the product of our past ancestors, they are with us always. That is just who we are. Indo-European religion is not Abrahamic, that is an alien religion.

I don't get what you are saying when you are arguing that Egypt's consumption suddenly makes Israel and Egypt at a stalmate?  The advantage of having a higher GDP and population means the relative costs for military equipment, soldiers, etc, is diluted and they can afford to spend more to exert influence then Israel can.  And it just will get worse with time because Israel is locked into a small fixed land and their population isn't growing, or can't grow, as fast.

Besides Jordan, Libanon and Turkey, which countries outside Europe are truly helping avert this refugee crisis?

It's petty beyond belief that countries claim a right to not do anything, whether they're closer to the crisis than Europe or not. And yes, I'm talking the entire world here. It's something we should have been able to sort out via UN (and then EU), if there were actually the possibility of any decisions being made there (the security council is one of the greatest errors of human history).

And Europe's burdens don't even stop with flooding all of Africa and the Middle East's problems up here, oh no. Many once they come can't even be a little grateful that they actually got to live in a much more developed part of the world. And you know what? That's not even that much of a problem to me. What really frustrates me is when, and this is an increasing trend, refugees don't bother to make a single effort in adapting to their new **home**.

If you become a citizen or even just a resident of any country, that implies you respect it's laws and regulations, speak the language and identify yourself as a citizen (whether solely that or in combination with other things). If you come here it is not ok to segregate yourself and pretend you're still in the country where you came from. 


Being an immigrant (which many refugees become), also means you change nationality. To use a metaphor: You don't repitch your tent in a different place. You go out and acquire a new tent with other capabilities and set it up in an environment that suits it.

I'm not interested in assimilation (that'd be boring and totalitarian), but adaptation and mutual respect. We respect refugees by allowing them and treating them well, and they respect us by behaving in a civilized manner and striving to be a positive influence (it's the intent that matters, whether they succeed or fail).

Tl;dr: Refugees can't have it both ways. If you want our money, security and welfare you also have to abide by our rules and customs (democracy, rule of law etc.).

If we are forced to accept 3-4,000 immigrants a year then that adds up pretty quickly. We also don't have jobs for them and we don't have endless money in our coffers to give to them as welfare. And the majority of the population see it as unfair that they take jobs Maltese citizens need, and they get to take out of a welfare system they never paid into, while poor Maltese children go hungry because there isn't enough welfare money.",cunihvc,t3_3j805o,,0,t3_3j805o,t5_2qh1i,0,1444117095,2,2,,,AskReddit,gozit,1441145635

Germany sort of controls the EU, so they might be able to force a unified refugee policy, with unified centrally funded food and housing. That might remove the incentive for people to go to the few countries that look after them like humans. The countries that do have a low refugee per capita are generally quite right wing (e.g. Hungary, Poland), so it'll be a tough thing to do.

Now shift that fight to Russia and add in the number of times the Russians have ever lost a home turf fight during the winter, and it's pretty much the only option.

The USSR's military was no joke, either way it goes this fight might even be worse than WWII. While the Soviets would be fighting with limited supplies and under heavy pressure, this is *exactly what the Soviets specialized in doing*.

1441150353,"&gt;And as you'll have seen from that link, there is a variety of opinion on whether or not the UK benefits economically from being in the EU.

You'll find - as mentioned in the review of same studies - that those that conclude that the EU has a negative fiscal impact fail to account for benefits such as foreign direct investment and higher trade flows (ie. the very benefits I mentioned earlier)by way of example. Instead they take a relatively narrow static approach to same. More thorough reviews, that account for FDI by way of example, find that the EU has a net benefit.

&gt;I'm not sure why you think that the UK Supreme Court would not be able to hold the UK government to its legal obligations. 

Given the significant body of law that has seen the ECtHR effectively overturn UKSC cases, that would seem to be exactly the case. 

&gt;As for departing from precedence from the ECHR, that is entirely appropriate.

Not particularly. The entire reason for an international treaty protecting human rights is that it operates at a supranational basis, as human rights should exist beyond the interpretation of Courts of member states. Otherwise UK Courts could - and have attempted to - simply take a harmonious approach to applying the treaty (Hirst, by way of example). This effectively results in some people being entitled to fundamental human rights and others not, based solely on a border. 

&gt;Ultimately the people that enact legislation should be elected politicians, not unelected judges. 

Not talking about legislation at all. Talking about precedent. If you'd rather elected officials handle all jurisprudence, look at the US and the failures of directly elected judges there.

This is mostly incorrect. Europeans are the dominant group in Russia, by a large majority, with [over 80% of the country being European.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Russia#Ethnic_groups)

&gt;""As of the 2010 census, 80.90% of the population that disclosed their ethnicity (111,016,896 people) is ethnically Russian...""

Furthermore, claiming the area's east are not European is false as well. Here's an [Ethnographic Map of the Russian Empire](http://euromaidanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/af06683d315efabba6424909876825251.jpg), so you can see how the Europeans are spread across their territories. The R.F. cut off most of it's territories with non-European ethnicities, like Kazakhstan. Arguably, they cut off too much, and should be absorbing more territories, such as [Northern Kazakhstan, which is predominantly filled with Ethnic Europeans.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Kazakhstan_Slavic_2010_Rus.png/500px-Kazakhstan_Slavic_2010_Rus.png)

&gt;the Baltics and Poland (the victims of MRP) are leading USA

Honestly, this statement is a fantasy. It's totally disconnected from reality. The USA is using these small Central European countries (including Poland, which is relatively small and weak compared to the US) to take down it's only hostile rival in Europe. The war hawks in Washington were looking for a proxy to take care of Russia, like a Pakistan to India, to keep them occupied. That's the purpose you serve for them. They don't need to be ""led"". They were the prime leaders of the conflict, and still are. The US has always used proxies to fight their wars for them, as it's a good strategy to avoid engaging in conflict yourself, while forcing opponents to fight wars in their geographic region (away from the US). 

[Here's a comparison of the total GDP of the Baltics, Poland, and Russia vs the USA.

Don't delude yourself about who is playing who. I think it's excruciatingly clear who is in charge. The fact that Eastern Europeans are being used to accomplish America's goals, does not mean that they are ""leading"" America. 

&gt;You would say that, wouldn't you?

Just for the record, as we go into this, I'm not Ethnically Russian. I'm Ukrainian-Canadian. Though I've been to the Baltics before, and lived in other parts of Eastern Europe/Europe.

Regarding my nuclear comment, I don't think it's possible to compete in a Nuclear world without a deterrent. America, China, anyone who wants your lunch can come fuck with you. There's a reason America is hesitant to put boots on the ground in Russia right now. And if you're just *starting* to build up your arsenal now, already 20-30 years behind in technology, Central Europe will constantly be in a state of catch up. Just as Russia is playing to the US. What Europeans should be looking for is not a ""good enough"" strategy as they have been. We can see the result of that strategy and what it does to society in Western Europe. What Europe needs is an independent military structure, that looks after European interests first. Europe has it's own geographic priorities, that are not the same as someone on a different continent. What is good for America (destroying Syria, fucking up the Middle East), can be bad for Europe (the current migrant crisis, terrorism threats, etc).

&gt;I am eagerly awaiting your clever explanation of the matters ;-)

I'll think this through a bit before responding. You're somewhat correct. Though I do know that pre-revolutionary Russia, those that were at the top were mostly Ethnic Russians. This was changed after the revolution, where other ethnic groups started taking over the secret police and such. I.e., the Georgian mafia, Stalin, etc. A good place to figure out the correct answer to this, would be to figure out who were the people in the ""power class"" of society in the R.E. That is, the head of the police, the heads of government/senate, etc.

1441151521,"&gt; Except you're assuming that those immigrants actually integrate well. Let me tell you, too many do not.

As someone who lives in a formerly conservative sprawling American city wherein more than 50 LANGUAGES are spoken daily? Let me assure you that failure to integrate is entirely the failure of the host society. 

&gt;May I ask you in what country you live? Have you experienced the immigration in some parts in Europe right now?

Oh, much moreso. We have 500,000 Spanish-speaking immigrants in the Metro Atlanta area. That's JUST the Spanish-speakers, mind you. In ONE CITY.

The equivalent might be if you took literally all of the migrants currently comprising your little ""crisis,"" invited their neighbors, relatives, friends, and families, and then settled ALL of them in, say, Budapest. 

We not only did OK, but it caused an economic boom. Money isn't raining from the sky, because we're in a serious ""recession,"" (actually a Depression) but immigration is the reason we're not Detroit, Newark, Chattanooga, or Montgomery, Alabama. We survived better, recovered faster, and are poised to grow where they're NOT. Because all their best people came here. It's not a closed system - more people means more production, more consumption, more tax money flying around, better restaurants, more perspectives, full schools, upward movement. 

My native language is English, and I speak a bit of Mandarin and German. That doesn't help me because my neighbors speak Spanish, Korean, Cantonese, Laotian, Amharic, and Hmong. Still, we manage to live and do business. SOMEHOW, I can buy delicious bulgogi tacos using gestures and shared jargon, and no one has to kill anyone in a haze of jingoistic anxiety. It's *amazing.* 

My town was kind of shitty and experiencing the ""brain drain"" of the American South, until it became an immigration destination. Without new people, we'd be Charleston, South Carolina all over again. No one wants to go to Charleston, South Carolina. Everyone who's able, and has two brain cells to rub together is leaving there, and they're coming here. 

&gt;Refugees are welcome to flee their country, but economical immigrants that won't (even try to) contribute to society (just seeking welfare) are not.

That's not a thing, actually. It's really not. You've been lied to, somewhere. Even if it were, how about stop saying ""economic refugee"" and start saying ""people who want to participate in growing my economy?"" It's the same thing, but with a more realistic perspective. 

The fact is that new people will want to assimilate, as long as the rules are clear and the path to success isn't blocked or changed without notice. That's just how humans work. If your society is racist and denies them opportunities, or appears to change the rules on them, that's when people enclave and stop trying to participate. 

People are rational and they're ""joiners,"" they'll join in with the crowd if you let them. If you don't let them, they'll rationally decide not to play your games, since the only option is to lose.

It's a Polish game made by Polish developers based on a 'Polish' fantasy universe created by a Polish author. They already represent a much-overlooked minority - the Slavs. 

Poland is 99.7% white. No, literally. 30,000 PoC's scattered across a country of fifty million. It's very much possible to spend an entire life without seeing a black person. 

It all goes back to Sapkowski more or less. The Witcher universe does acknowledge other ethnicities, they just happen to delegated to 'distant fuck off faraway lands' which is also your average Pole's experience with foreigners *nowadays*, let alone when Sapkowski first started writing. And the moment you start blaming an Eastern European author who spent forty years behind the Iron Curtain for not being racially diverse enough is the the moment you fucked up as far as common sense is concerned. 

In the context of Witcher 3's geography alone, there's no way to have even single PoC there that wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb. At best you could maybe plop a trader or two down in the major city and play it for laughs while being self-aware about how white everyone else is. At worst you're just pandering and pulling off some blatant tokenism.

Bullshit.  It isn't a ""refugee camp"" if you are a citizen in the city you are living in.

Those people are not denied citizenship. The article is talking about greater state surveillance of these people. **Not that they actually have no rights**. 

Inever said they have no rights.  I said they aren't citizens.  My previous link backed that up.

IT was more than one guy.

Why woudl a guy who smashed the skull of a 4 yr old israeli get labeled a pan arab hero on the largest Arab news network?  Get a parade?

&gt;The gas price accusation was tied to the real fact that Mubarak was selling oil to Israel under market prices as part of a corruption scheme. This directly led to higher prices for gas in Egypt. This was more of an accusation against Mubarak than against Israel

I was there in 03 and 04.  That deal was signed in 05.

If you have proof the deal was corrupt I would love to hear it.  But Ihope you realize if you have a pipeline of gas the person on the cost per unitis going to be lower as it isn't shipped.

&gt;Of course not all, and of course its a complicated issue, but regardless of our opinions about who is at fault, there are millions of people who look at Israel today occupying the west bank and east jerusalem who think that this is oppression.

False,"&gt;there is no explanation of why.

Alright, here it is quick and dirty. The 75mm gun was capable of penetrating most threats until mid 1944 when the Panther came onto the scene in a big way. That tank, and not the Tiger, was what really sent the troops clamoring for better weapons. But better weapons were already on their way in the form of 76mm armed Shermans and 90mm armed TDs. The 76mm gun was very good against everything but late war German heavies, and the glacis of the Panther was nearly invulnerable until the Americans figured out their shell quality issues and got HVAP over to Europe in significant quantities. But then, most German AFVs weren't Tigers (lol), nor were they even Panthers, most German AFVs in Panzer IVs and Stugs and that sort of thing. Neither of those tanks were immune to the 75mm or 76mm guns.

But, for *most* threats, the 76mm was just fine, and indeed the US kept the Sherman in service for quite a bit after the war. The 76mm gun also did very well against T-34s in Korea. 

There is no question that the US could have been more proactive about getting 76mm armed Shermans to the front, but the system at the time relied on front line troops telling the folks back home that they needed them. Up until Normandy no one wanted the new tanks because they simply didn't see the point. Nothing they had come up against was outside the capabilities of their 75mm guns.

False,"As a Libertarian, I wish I could remove the influence of those dumb conspiracy theorists. Especially the 9/11 ones.

When the whole premise of Libertarianism is that private interests can do the government's job better than government can, because government is inherently inefficient, there's no way that can be consistent with the idea that our government was able to effectively work with the national media, the airlines, etc. to bring down the World Trade Center and somehow blame it on a certain foreign group just to gain public support for the War on Terror.

What's the opposite of a Libertarian anyway? There's no authoritarian party... so I guess it's both the Republicans and Democrats?

My answer for the Republicans is relatively easy. Get rid of all the neo-cons who believe in ""security"" bullshit and gave us the TSA, and sharply reduce the size of our military.

The Democrats? Who knows where to start. I guess the broadest, but most necessary change to get my vote, would be to get rid of the whole SJW mindset in which people are divided into useless demographics and are determined to be ""privileged"" or ""disadvantaged"". That entire concept applied to vague groups is bullshit. But the Democrats would still need much more change to impact my vote.

False,"&gt;""Terrorist"" lulz!

Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by the European Union, Canada, Israel, Egypt, Japan, and the United States. Australia and the United Kingdom have designated the military wing of Hamas, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, as a terrorist organization.  So it isn't too far fetched to use the word to describe their violent activities.

&gt;You know what other ""terrorist"" Iran backed? Nelson Mandela

And?  That doesn't stop their government from being theocratic in nature.  You assume when I say it's theocratic, I mean it can do no good, I never said that.  That isn't what theocratic means.  

Who is Iran's top leader who sets Iran's foreign and domestic tone and policy, and who is also it's commander in chief? That be Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  He has the power to appoint and dismiss the leaders of the judiciary, the state radio and television networks, and the supreme commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He also appoints six of the twelve members of the Council of Guardians, the powerful body that oversees the activities of Parliament and determines which candidates are qualified to run for public office. What is he otherwise?  A cleric of Islam, a religious leader. He is appointed by a religious assembly (Council of Experts, who is a deliberative body of Mujtahids (Islamic theologians)), not by the people in an election.  

Iran's top leader is a 'man of the cloth', therefore it is ultimately a theocratic state.

I don't think that's true. I mean, maybe at some points in history this has been the case. Since the advent of nuclear weapons, though, the situation has changed.

We do talk to our enemies, and comparable states behave in similar ways diplomatically. Israel will probably talk to Iran before the reverse will occur, for example.

The US has stayed out of a leadership role in the Ukrainian conflict, allowing EU states to take charge, while providing all the political, economic, and military resources the EU has asked for... the full faith and credit of the NATO alliance, as it were.

1441193979,"That's a good one, but I'll present some things I believe would improve it:

For the consonants, I suggest d, r and gi should still be distinguished as they are distinguished in written words (""da"" for *skin*, ""ra"" for *going out*; ""dữ"" for *evil* and ""giữ"" means ""keep"") as well as in certain dialects. Similarly, ch and tr should also be distinguished for orthography and dialectal reasons.

That design still includes diacritics for tones (acute and falling tones still the same, plus using umlauts) but place a q after vowels to mark another tone. In fact, that is the sole use of the letter q (the digraph qu is replaced with kw). It might not serve well for some, so maybe a new letter can be introduced in its place (as q is commonly a consonant).

Plus tonal diacritics should not be placed on all vowels of a multigraph. In the current system, it is placed on the second vowel (eg tiểu, sướng) except if there is no consonant following a diphthong (mía, chùa). So perhaps a rule could be made to specify which letter should the diacritics be on.

I believe ligatures can and should be used for ""ae"" and ""oe"". I suggest ""eu"" be replaced with our letter ø, ""nj"" and ""ng"" with the respective IPA symbols. As ch and tr are to be distinguished, I'd use ""c"" for ch and ""tj"" for tr (I somehow also like the idea of using Icelandic eth ð for tr, but that's beginning to go silly). th (the author uses ""c"") would be replaced with Icelandic thorn þ. (this part is purely for aesthetical purposes and since many people in Vietnam writes in continuous cursive style, a bit of practicality)

The use of ""nh"" as a final consonant replacing ng and nh (actually there is no ngh at the end of a syllable) means words such as ""làng"" *village* and ""lành"" *good* can no longer be distinguished. The author did not specify a new version for ch as a final consonant, but it can't be replaced by c (""rác"" means *rubbish* and ""rách"" means *torn*) - also k is never at the end.

Also, Vietnamese's strict orthography-phonology correspondence is generally unmatched in other languages written in Latin script, so I suppose it would just serve better if they drop that. I'd say very strict because you can generally correctly pronounce every word even if you have never seen it.

EDIT: S and X should remain distinguished as well. Check ""sâu"" *deep*/*caterpillar* and ""xâu"" *chain*.

That's my take on that version, from someone quite a good and frequent user of the language. Most of it is just silly anyway, don't take it serious.

P/S: I did try my best searching through the article on ""Latin alphabets"" trying to replace most of those digraphs.",cunt65h,t3_3j8inh,O Mighty Dyrlægens natmad,0,t1_cunq3n0,t5_2sih3,0,1444122190,3,3,,dk,polandball,LaptopZombie,1441166406

False,"&gt;A little backstory: the AAP didn't recommend it previously. The AAP changed their language to this so that insurance companies still covered circumcision:

""the benefits of newborn male circumcision justify access to this procedure for those families who choose it.""

Holy Crap! Alert the media, you have uncovered collusion between the AAP and the insurance industry! You do have proof, other than this uncited, unverifiable anecdote, right?

Oh, wait. thanks, but that quote proves absolutely nothing.

&gt;Then why are all of these lower in Europe?

Because sexual health and the transmission of disease is affected most by more than one factor. Couple that with the abysmal sexual health education in the US and you should understand. This is something that the religious right has destroyed in the US.

But the AMA and CDC also agrees that circumcision has medical benefits too, but they are probably colluding with the insurance industry, right?

OGN rolls with it, but the LCS also has to deal with a shared viewerbase between EU and NA; and on days where NA runs after the EU matches, overlapping schedules and delays.

As such, refugees are actually extremely desperate not to be caught by authorities until they reach Germany because they would be forced to claim asylum where they were found and denied the opportunity to live in a comparatively wealthy and more generous country.

In fact, that the authorities are too overwhelmed to catch and process any more than a small fraction of asylum seekers (a process that takes months in any European country) is the ultimate reason why the crisis has suddenly arisen even though Syria has been in a state of war for nearly five years. In 2013, it would have been a pipe dream to make it to Germany without being caught, processed, and forced to live in Greece or Hungary.

Die Bundesländer sollten sich um die [Verwaltung](http://a.referata.com/wiki/Verwaltungsreform) der Region kümmern, der [Bund die Gesetze](http://a.referata.com/wiki/Landesgesetze) machen. „Auf keinen Fall wolle er die Bundesländer abschaffen“, betonte Muhm.

Den größten Handlungsbedarf sieht der AK-Direktor in Österreich beim Bildungsthema. „Wenn 25 Prozent der Pflichtschulabsolventen nicht ausreichend Lesen, Schreiben und Rechnen können, dann haben wir ein Problem.“ Auch die „vermachteten“ Märkte in Österreich - etwa der Einzelhandel - würden die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit belasten. Hierzulande halten die drei größten Supermarktketten Rewe, Spar und Hofer einen Marktanteil von 85 Prozent.

Der AK-Chefökonom Markus Marterbauer ortet hingegen „methodologische Probleme“ in den Wettbewerbsrankings, etwa von IWF und IMD, in denen Österreich in den vergangenen Jahren zurückgefallen ist. Ernstnehmen müsste man aber die negative Einschätzung der befragten Manager. „Wenn die Stimmung bei den Managern schlecht ist, dann wird weniger investiert“, betonte Marterbauer. Seit der Wirtschaftskrise 2008 gebe es eine Investitionsschwäche. Seit 2007 ist das Bruttoinlandsprodukt in Österreich um 5 Prozent gewachsen, ohne Wirtschaftskrise wäre es geschätzt um 15 Prozent gewachsen. „Das ist gewaltig“, so Marterbauer.",cunv8wu,t3_3jbig7,,0,t3_3jbig7,t5_35jiv,0,1444123169,1,1,,,Politik_de,LeonardoDR,1441171311

This is having a big effect on Sunnis around the world, even in the West. Even if they don't identify as Wahhabi, the more hardline teachings are seeping into their beliefs.

Which calendar applies, depends on your nationality, but if you're American or European, the Roman calendar would probably be most applicable. It counted dates from the founding of Rome over 700 years pre-AD.  
It continued in use until somewhere around 525 AD, when they decided to count from the (approximate) birth of Christ. And in doing so, screwing up in oh so many ways. The least of which is the inherent lack of proper records of the actual birth year of Jesus. They forgot 4 years due to an Emperor switching names, and since they used Roman numerals there also wasn't a 0 BC or 0 AD.

Long story short, they are quite right to reject -25 as a birth year, for multiple reasons.

&gt; Yes they can. I'm doing it right now.

Let me rephrase that. They can not be used sensibly in a logical manner for a societal purpose such as defending a ""tribe"".

Your defence is neither logical, nor scientific. It's just racism.

&gt; rac·ism ∙ ˈrāˌsizəm ∙ _noun_ : the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races; prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.

That's not a communist's definition (as you incorrectly allege - the word was first used in the context of Nazi theories and replaced much earlier words _racialism_ that pre-dates communism by more than a hundred years), it's just what the word means. 

You believe that there are characteristics or abilities specific to a group of people that makes them superior (in the case of white) or inferior (in the case of non-whites), and you wish to use that as a means to discriminate by denying them access to living in certain parts of the World.

The odd thing is if you just said ""I'm a racist"", I'd have an iota more respect for you than I do now. I'd disagree with you, but at least you were being honest with everybody, including yourself.

&gt; Let's even ignore behavioral and intellectual differences between races. Even if all races are equally capable you would still have to persuade me to live among negroids for example. Their facial features are abominable and quite frankly, archaic-looking and tremendously ugly. It makes me a bit agitated on the inside every time I see one simply because how different and alien they look compared to me and my people. Asking me to live among them is like asking me to live among Klingons.

This statement suggests pretty conclusively that you are driven by irrational fear, that you are using science to justify that fear, and therefore you are a self-deluded racist.

I have some wonderful news for you: the more time you spend around people who don't look like you, the less you think of them as different and the more comfortable you will be.

As you claim to be such a fan of science read up on the [cross-race effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-race_effect) and question whether your view of non-white people is because of your lack of experience of living, working and socialising with them.

&gt; Your entire argumentation is based on Lewontin's fallacy so you have no authority to call other theories shaky.

I love how you call it a ""fallacy"" just because Edwards did. Nobody else seems to agree with Edwards in thinking it's a fallacy, the general consensus is that Edwards didn't understand the point Lewontin was making. Read [Marks](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3NRf_8gwmO8C&amp;pg=PA270&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) for example.

&gt; You're engaging in deconstructivism. The equivalent of anarcho-capitalists and Libertarians finding borders terrifying. Where do YOU draw the line? Your own skin?

I don't need to draw a line when it comes to ""defending"" anything. I accept genetic difference for what it is, evolution for what it is, local clustering of genetic divergence as an artefact of historically quite slow migration routes due to poor communication links.

I'm not the one who is angry. I'm not the paranoid one. I don't need to be terrified of anything, and I'm not. 

You are the one who is terrified, you are the one who is ""a bit agitated on the inside every time"" you see a non-white person. When it comes to ""race"" I have nothing to fear, you have everything to fear.

And when I point out the ludicrous nature of your argument - that wanting to define a country by one set of arbitrary genetic markers means a country can be argued for that is defined by _any_ set of arbitrary genetic markers, and therefore _all_ sets of arbitrary genetic markers can be used to justify a country of its own - your reaction is an ad hominem attack against me.

If you want a country for people who are white, I want a country for people who are lactose intolerant. Why can't I have that using exactly your arguments?

And if I can have that, if somebody else claims they find people with red/ginger hair ""weird"" or ""ugly"", can they have a country where they are banned? If not, why not?

&gt; It cannot be more scientific. There are genomes there that prove different behavioral patterns

No, there aren't. Behavioural genetics has not drawn any solid conclusions, and may be the last harbour for racists in the scientific community, and even then it's not taken particularly seriously.

If you think you have found an example, I suspect I'm going to find several responses to the paper you cite pointing out the flaws in it, how genes are confounding variables in the experiments carried out, and so on.

That's because all behavioural genetic papers seem to exhibit that quality.

&gt; No, it must not. It will extend to a point where people are comfortable living with each other. No more, no less.

I'm comfortable living with everybody. The majority of people with similar life experiences to me - living in large multi-cultural populations - have no problem living alongside people of all races.

We find people who are not used to living in such populations are afraid because of a shallow racism that founded on a mixture of social ignorance, sometimes poor science, and a general lack of experience of interacting with people from other cultures.

Further, people who open themselves up to those experiences will frequently discover that in hindsight, they were racist, and adjust their views, and be comfortable living with a cross-cultural mix.

In other words, the problem is not with society: the problem is with you.

If the objective is to make you feel comfortable living with black people, experience shows all we have to do is make you live with black people. If you confine yourself to white-only neighbourhoods and insist on segregation, all it will do is lead you to be perpetually fearful of ""them"", and you will never be truly comfortable even if they live hundreds of miles away from you.

So, do yourself a favour, stop with the faux science and face your fears head-on.

&gt; I'm most certainly not arguing for some arbitrary, artificially imposed type of segregation 

Yes you are.

&gt; but a more instinctual and spontaneous one.

That is completely arbitrary and defined by you and your fellow racists here in /r/european.

&gt; If Ukrainians are not comfortable living with Russians, let them separate. Same goes for every other group of people.

So now different groups of caucasians get to arbitrarily define their boundaries based on cultural and historical differences? Where is the science to support this? Or have we just skipped out of the science of genetic difference and now going for pure outright arbitrary fear?

Dragging the Ukraine into this conversation is not going to do you any favours. It just undermines your position entirely because you're conflating a complex socioeconomic history with your genetic arguments and making both look silly.

&gt; No matter how you turn it, Whites have no possible chance or a ''permission'' of survival in your world, thus making you anti-white. 

Because you are afraid, _I_ am guilty? Uhhh huuuh. That is exactly the sort of fuddled logic I can expect from a complete and total idiot.

You have not won the argument, you've simply shown you don't have a case for your side of it.

Once again, how is this working out for you? All your arguments have done is identified you are agitated by people who aren't white, proved beyond reasonable doubt to a subjective outsider that you are racist, and made me more certain of my argument.

Why are you here? Why is /r/european here? It is actively doing the exact opposite of its stated purpose. You are producing material I can show to a child and say ""see, this is what logical fallacy looks like, this is what racism looks like, this is what being really bad at science by drawing false conclusions and selectively filtering your sources looks like"" and they too will think you're bat-shit crazy.

...
&gt; so be a bit more humble about the position you find yourself in.

Man, you sure know how to live by your own words. First of all, you know absolutely nothing about me, so even starting to talk about age, experience and walking in another's shoes is not only condescending, it's just so humiliatingly asinine, I can only wonder how horribly difficult it must be to actually know you in person.

&gt; separation (fascism) 

Hahahaha... So now separation of cultures = fascism!? Wow... You need to take some lessons man. Being European, I can tell you for sure, living in such a relatively small area, while sticking to our individual cultures, basically only united by the ideals and way of life of ""western civilization"" is probably one of the most incredible things about Europe. We embrace our individuality, and we thrive on having room for everyone, admiring each other's differences - as long as those differences are a) collectively positive or b) something we can tolerate. Not everyone likes all cultures, and we have many ""rivalries"", but most are in good fun, and those that aren't are still tolerated with very little *actual* animosity. 

The danger in Muslim cultures isn't that it's different. It's that the values are just so far from ours, and OBJECTIVELY (from a perspective of western values) not cohesive or in any way positive. 

&gt; People who travel don't go to look at these different cultures like they're different types of animals in a fucking zoo, 

Did I say that!? No. I'm pretty sure I just said it's exciting and interesting, which is exactly what it is. You experience a different way of life, sometimes so exotic that it's very different, and sometimes it's not so exotic, because it might be a neighboring country - and yet it's still different enough to be interesting. 

&gt; No one culture is objectively superior to all others 

That very much depends on your definition of ""objectively superior"". Western values, is objectively superior to cultures that dehumanizes women, gay people, people of different race, creed or religion or approves of murder, rape and slavery.

These are all values that western civilization has collectively decided is bad, and objectively so - if the object is for as many people as possible to live free, and have a chance at a good life.

So you see, when a culture shows signs of approving of, or living by these values, I am in my right to distance myself and condemn those cultures. 

&gt; The evils you see in other cultures were evils in yours not long ago

Firstly, it was long ago. Secondly, I can't atone for past generations sins. I can only address the situation as it is right now, and right now, the values I see, and *some* of the cultural customs and aspects of Muslim countries are excruciatingly horrible and should not be treated with anything short of open disdain. 

Does that mean I consider the western civilization to be without reproach? Fuck no. That's one of the great things about western civilization. I'm not only able to, but I'm ALLOWED to be openly critical of government and cultural aspects of my OWN culture and civilization. But that doesn't change the fact that there are some disturbing things happening in Muslim countries, that should not be taken lightly or in a ""well, that's their custom/culture"" sort of way.

As an American, I don't have any opinion on how many people Sweden should or shouldn't take- it's a small country and god only knows what 5 million more people showing up in a nation built for 10 million would do to its ability to maintain order. If you want to fill your country with refugees, that's an interesting experiment. If you don't want refugees in numbers greater than would be noticed, that's also a decision for your nation.

What is deserving of derision are posts akin to ""he's just got great intangibles"". It's not being specific. I like the more...tangible intangibles, if that makes any sense. 

Your specified case here is, most certainly, an example of just that. The team all attended the birthday of Milana, and bore witness to her struggle and her family's struggle. Her father's the captain of the team now. I ought to temper my perspective as I'm not in the room experiencing it, but I believe there is a lot of love in that room, and a lot of unified growth from hardship. I do agree it to be directly reflected in his performance, and subsequently their performance as a team.  

But ""intangibles"" can be simpler than that. As far as simple characteristics go, ""ice veins"" is one I particularly find notable, definitely a characteristic some players have and others don't. Anze Kopitar always seems collected and in control, while someone like Toews is more of a (ahem) ""heated"" competitor: passionately engaged, but can lose his head if he's upset. They are both fearless, and both give the team what they need seemingly when they need it the most. 

NHL players are a diverse and numerous group of human life forms, each carrying uniquely individual experiences that have imprinted upon them an array of specific skills and attributes. Are Europeans more susceptible (though not exclusively prone) to having ""ice veins"" because of their comparably different culture, whereas the North Americans often have their hearts on their sleeves, encouraged and entitled to speak their minds as Don Cherry would have them do? ""Intangibles"" as a term can really be that broad. 

The Sedins exhibit sheer in-the-moment cunning, top-flight work ethic, and deeply-planned strategy; all linked by their ""twin telepathy"". It's their most unique intangible, the kind of playmaking chemistry you can only develop with a life-long linemate. From person to person, each player possesses their own unique arsenal. 

I don't bother with the more blurrily-defined terms like ""clutch"", ""choker"", ""proven winner"" etc because those always seem to mean different things to different people (though, there is precisely 0 disagreement about whether or not Kane/Toews/Keith are ""proven winners"").

I know just a little Uzbek, and while Uzbek did have its script changed, I do not believe it underwent the kind of language reform that was imposed on Turkey by the Republic of Turkey.

I do not see any indication that Uzbek has attempted to eject words of Persian or Arabic origin like Turkish has. This should be a great help for speakers of Uzbek to learn to read and understand languages like Chagatay. In fact, I suspect that Uzbeks could learn to understand Ottoman Turkish perhaps as fast as Turks in Turkey can, given their relative strengths and handicaps. Of course, just as Modern Turkish has absorbed vocabulary from western European languages, Uzbek has in its time absorbed plenty of Russian vocabulary.

False,"Hi OP, the South of France is indeed a gorgeous choice (not gonna lie, i was born and raised in the South West). I'll just take a minute to remind you that Europe is VERY rural. In France, a small town doesn't have 30 000 inhabitants, it will generally be between 200 and 2000. Keep that in mind when looking for lodgings, you can easily be 20 miles from the nearest ATM or grocery shop.

I would recommend touching down in a big city, such as Bordeaux or Toulouse to get acquainted with the region. To give you an idea, Bordeaux is more of a coastal city where the minds are a bit more modern, Toulouse is in the heartlands where the hearts are a bit warmer. To put it simply : we call them hillbillies, they call us snobs. They have tons of reaggae bands, we have all the hipster shit.

There's a good trick to come live here, but it only works if you're a hard worker and don't care about living a bit of a marginal lifestyle for a couple months : come for the vendanges! (wine grapes harvesting). It's hard work, and the hours are tough, but it pays nicely and the owners sometimes lodge the workers in trailers for free or nearly free. Plus you'll meet plenty of people from a broad cross section of the local population. I know a few friends whose social circle was bootstrapped at the vendanges.

Or if you're more of a tech guy Bordeaux has a nascent startup scene that is easy to get in touch with on Meetup, or by going to ""Le Node"" or ""Darwin"".

False,"Wikipedia has the answer.

After the development of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century, in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into calories (in a relatively small space and in a relatively short period of time). Many of those calories came in the form of fat and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.

When it was introduced to the American South, fried chicken became a common staple. Later, as the slave trade led to Africans being brought to work on southern plantations, the slaves who became cooks incorporated seasonings and spices that were absent in traditional Scottish cuisine, enriching the flavor. Since most slaves were unable to raise expensive meats, but generally allowed to keep chickens, frying chicken on special occasions continued in the African American communities of the South. It endured the fall of slavery and gradually passed into common use as a general Southern dish. Since fried chicken traveled well in hot weather before refrigeration was commonplace, it gained further favor in the periods of American history when segregation closed off most restaurants to the black population. Fried chicken continues to be among this region's top choices for ""Sunday dinner"" among both blacks and whites.",cunyv5a,t3_3jc25c,,0,t3_3jc25c,t5_2sokd,0,1444124939,10,10,,,explainlikeimfive,KingKha,1441184961

Funny how online arsenal fans seem to be the only fans in all of world football that have this mentality and approach to football. Signings don't win you titles! Must be so special.

Despite every title winning big club in the last 10 years in Europe making signings year on year to build on the squad and strengthen to compete. Despite Wenger in his early years spending massively and taking big risks, then going again and doing the same after he won titles. Suddenly that's all wrong, and now we're right in that filling holes in the squad, like I don't know a third Cb last summer so the title challenge isn't over by October and Flamini doesn't get 19 starts before Christmas, is the wrong thing. 

Wenger says what he says about signings because what else is he meant to say? It goes against everything he first did at the club when he actually won titles, like pushing Dein further and further to buy a 4th Forward in Wiltord to complement the 3 fantastic strikers we already had - to the point the club basically admitted we overpaid for him. Why? Because Wenger categorically told him we couldn't mount a title challenge without another striker.

The board as is, isn't about winning or competing, it's about being content with staying where we are. You have to take risks to win. You don't stagnate and remain static to win. No title winning club has ever, EVER, done this. Everything being put out by the club about signings is nonsense.

So either now his hands are tied, or he's done a U turn. Fact is if Wenger had a blank cheque he would sign year on year. To make out signings and buying a back up striker or DM is just for the sake of it is a cop out and nonsense. You've fallen for the mindless PR the clubs been putting out out that contradicts everything in modern football.

Given that the EU's budget is limited and ITER already has been facing delays and 100-200% cost overruns, the shortfall will have to be funded by cutting other research projects... and that until it starts producing energy and stops being research in 2090 or around that time.

So the refugees are pressing on, in defiance of EU regulations, to countries like Sweden and Germany, which have promised spaces for them.

So, as far as Germany and Sweden are concerned, hang the EU regulations: deporting innocent people to their almost certain deaths is not an option. So these countries are officially registering them as asylum seekers, and thus declaring them *legally* in the country. If their applications are approved, they become *legal* immigrants.

1441190690,"Let me tell you that as a European I am just as confused as you are. I would love for someone to actually try and show the statistics and unbiased information. 

From what can be objectively said this is true:

* American political and military intervention taking place in many Arab countries either caused or helped to cause a state of crisis and war with the most destabilized countries - Iraq, Syria and Libya - being openly in the state of war/civil war with *millions* of people being displaced as a result.

* Europe has been for decades known for their refugee-friendly policies and has several internal accords that bind European countries to support asylum seekers and war refugees. Some see it as a sign of maturity while some see it as an invitation for abuse.

* Europe is known (whether correctly or not) for its generous welfare systems which show a very different picture for immigrants from Arab countries where welfare is not as ubiquitous and generous. It is also known for an official stance (even though many people disagree) of friendly acceptance and tolerance towards immigrants.

* Many people who become displaced as a result of those wars in the Middle East choose to migrate to Europe which is seen as both peaceful, stable and rich - and also is known of being supportive of refugees.  They tend to choose specific countries as a result of the opinions they hear - that's why they are all going to Sweden, Germany, France or Britain and are leaving other, closer but less friendly countries.

* Most Arab and Middle Eastern countries are either hostile to migrants and refugees (rich ones - Saudi Arabia, UAE) or are already full of them (Egypt, Turkey, Jordan) some being themselves on the verge of collapse (Lebanon)

* Most of the EU countries don't really know how to handle the issue because of the sheer scale of the migration. They don't necessarily like to refuse all the migrants who claim to be refugees but they simply can't handle the numbers and the way in which they are coming to Europe in droves. 

* Nobody knows why Germany decided to go against European accords on handling refugees and just unilaterally declared to accept them - it is very strongly against the nature of the EU and all the internal agreements like Schengen but it's not the first time when Germany does something irresponsible and expects everyone else to shoulder the consequences.

* There is a degree of selfishness and entitlement among migrants - to what degree it is very hard to establish as both sides of this story are incredibly political and distort the facts. But the stories - whether they are the norm or just the sign of the minority - are getting a lot of traction in the media.

* There is a degree of hostility and fear among the European population that those refugees are in fact just ordinary economic migrants who will come to Europe and will abuse the tolerance of the society, grow further in radical Islam, refuse to integrate, stay perpetually on welfare (like most Somali, Afghani and some other migrants **do**) and generally demand that the host country be more like the Shitlamistan they just left (sorry but as an atheist I am very strongly against the governments silent acceptance of islamisation of Europe, we already have one plague...don't need another).

* Europe doesn't have legal tools to effectively get rid of offending migrants and many parties on the left  are hoping to utilize the political capital of the migrants in the future and defend them even if they engage in overt criminal activity. This - exemplified by numerous violent clashes with police - is putting the social burden of their integration on the people and it is currently the main manner in which Europe ""deals"" with problematic migrants (does nothing or very little).

* The mishandling of immigration so far caused the spike in popularity among radical, xenophobic, right-wing parties - which the current crisis might only fuel more as it is *bound* to turn ugly once the initial welcomes wear down and reality sets in.
 
* It is impossible to tell whether all the people who claim to be refugees are indeed refugees or are just economic migrants pretending to be refugees for better chances of getting in. The majority of current refugees are young and male and claim to have left families back in the Arab countries.
There is no way to verify this.

* If the migrants are indeed refugees and come with families - therefore not unbalancing the countries demographically - the crisis can be handled relatively safely if not without cost. If the migrants are just opportunists seeking better life and abusing refugee status this will be more of the most problematic recent immigration resulting in more unemployment, more crime and more radicals.

* Nobody knows how many of them are of the radical muslim strand which is a very toxic thing to have *more of* in Europe at this point. The point with radical Islam is that it often is like radical Protestant Christianity (born-again etc). You can never know if someone is problematic until they start behaving in a problematic way.

* A million refugees in a year (and more to come) will be more of a shock to some countries than the infamous 2004 EU expansion which sparked large-scale economic migration within the EU since the potential refugees and the economic migrants have somewhat differing (and problematic) characteristics.

False,"&gt;But this is also why I really don’t have a problem with the way history was taught: I don’t want the state telling children why historical events happened the way they did. Give them the facts, keep these objective and let them form their own opinions. Even among professional historians “why” is always going to be a controversial question.
You could perhaps argue that pupils should be tested on their opinions – but without teacher guidance this is a recipe for disaster. It also invites personal politics into the classroom, especially when we’re dealing with more recent events. Imagine an exam question on why the Greek civil war or the junta happened – disaster!

C'mon na0, I'm not talking about asking the students to give their opinion on why Tsipras was elected, but rather (for example) ""what were the sociopolitical factors that favoured the rise of Fascism in Europe"" because right now we're content with ""blabla social upheaval, Weimar republic somethingorother, bad guys with bad ideas, now on to the dates dates dates!"". Perhaps my experience is more informed from how I see the average Greek understanding history than from the actual books; I don't even remember the exam questions for history in 2000.


&gt;But of course these things need funds

Eh, anything where the solution touches upon ""funding"" will get the reply that ""THERE'S NO MONEY"" so I guess we're screwed in that department. Perhaps there are other ways to motivate the teachers and make their experience a more fulfilling and productive one.

1441191406,"Afghanistan is not a member of any Middle Eastern groups, but is a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. Afghan culture and language can be considered closer to South Asia than the Middle East. Pashto is is an Eastern Iranian language, belonging to the Indo-European family. Dari is essentially a Afghan variant of Persian. Parts of Aghanistan were parts of India during the Raj (the British occupation of India). Don't quote me on this but there are at least 10 million Pashtun's in India alone.

Please describe these 'Indian features' you broadly categorise. Features perceived as 'Dravidian' by armchair anthropologists as you are also seen in the people of South-West Iran such as Khuzestan and Ilam, which I have already mentioned.

Do you know what the Rivayats were. They mention ethno-centrism, Dadabhai Naoroji (known as the Grand Old Man of India) was an Indian nationalist what about Madam Bhikaji Cama, Indian nationalism is by no means a ""recent phenomena"". You talk about Tata's and Wadia's, what about the Bella Captain who is thought to have been half Goan Christian and was adopted by a parsi family in Rangoon and a long drama ensured which I am sure you can read about... Bella was born at the turn of the last century and so her case predates both the Wadia and Tata cases. Also, the Wadia case is a completely different scenario as Neville Wadia's father converted to Christianity.

I hope you can learn from my comment and become a more constructive member (spenta mainyu) rather than one who is destructive on this subreddit (angra mainyu). I wish you peace and retrospection.

This should klear up konfusion and keyboards kan have 1 less letter. There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when the troublesome ""ph"" will be replaced with the ""f"". This will make words like ""fotograf"" 20% shorter. In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of the silent ""e""s in the language is disgraseful, and they should go away.

False,"&gt; There is no European identity. That's a false construct.

The modern British voter, everyone. Everything that involves humans is a false construct if you look at it a certain way, you're being obtuse if you don't believe the EU has fostered an unprecedented sense of identity among Europeans in an astonishingly short amount of time. I've studied politics with people from all over Europe and there is undoubtedly a European identity, but I presume you're interraction with European people boils down to you shouting at the television whenever the EU is mentioned on the news. It's real, it's out there, and Europeans who actually meet each other know it.

&gt;Why should the UK 'take orders' (ie. cede its sovereignty) to a governing body in which it is only a tiny part with little influence?

&gt;How can you dare to call the right of the country's people to decide on its future a petulant tantrum? That's what a large amount of UK people hate about the EU - the wishes of the British people are ignored and trivialised for constructed union.

I could not have imagined a better rant proving my point. You still think you're an Empire and everyone has to do what you want. For one thing, the UK should cede some of its sovereignty because we live in a modern interconnected world where it helps immensely to be a part of an economic and political bloc and it makes you all the stronger for it.

It is a petulant tantrum because many of the people calling to leave are uneducated, uninterested in being educated on the topic, racist and ignorant of politics and economics and the consequences of leaving the EU. 

Their reasons for leaving largely boil down to ""I don't like foreign people here,""  and also your ""I don't like having to do what any other country says, wehhh,"" which unfortunately seems to strike with even more educated people on the topic. The reasons for leaving are emotional or idealogical, not logical. Things aren't going your way so you threaten to leave, it's the definition of a tantrum.

Also it's ironic you say the EU is a constructed union, considering your country's barbaric history of massacring and colonising millions of people and countries around the globe. Many of these migrants are from countries your ancestors fucked up.

Russia has many many people from Central Asia. I'd say about 35-40% of the people living in Moscow are not Russian, but Central Asian (Tajik, Azeri, Kazakhstan, Uzbek).

It really puts a strain on the native population, it makes it harder for lower and middle class Russians to get jobs. They take up a lot of housing and other resources.

I find that people from Western Europe are extremely naive about immigration. They don't look into the future. They think they can ""integrate""??? Nope. These Arabs and Africans will always be different. You can't change a human's ethnicity, you cant change a human's nativness. A black guy who learns Norwegian will still never be Norwegian. One look at him and you know he is not an indigenous person, not a part of the nation.

Europe will be dealing with the consequences of this migration crisis 1000 years after Syria becomes peaceful again. Wars don't last forever, the negative effects of mass migration do last forever. White people have been living in the Americas for over 500 years, yet everyone knows we are not native here. Same thing with all these blacks and Arabs. 500 years from now there will be a non-white guy born in Germany who speaks German (non-whites will probably make up about 80-90% of the population by then), yet everyone will know that they are not native to this land. That they are foreign, they they wiped out a native people.

Leftist Europeans have absolutely no foresight into this situation. Wars dont last forever. Syria will become peaceful, their population will rebound, and Europe will be stuck with millions upon millions of for foreign people. What problem does mass migration solve? Nothing.

I bet the Native Americans wish they rejected all the English colonials instead of making alliances with them. Same thing will happen to indigenous Europeans, we will be wiped off the face of the Earth because of the shortsightedness of our inept Leftist leaders.


**This war will end in the near future.... yet the consequences of mass migration to Europe will last forever.** The migrants will exponentially grow, they will replace and displace the indigenous ethnic European population. The migrants will want more and more stuff from the natives. They will make it harder for the native to grow their own families.

Europe is digging it's own grave by letting these people in, the leaders dont learn from history. Ethnic Europeans will be foreigners on their own indigenous land in the future.

Then joins an expansion team in the middle of the season.  A team that had a lot of needs, none of which he himself fills.  None of the actual needs were addressed, so those faults are still there and he has not had time to build chemistry and learn about his team mates.

And a player of his caliber, is going to struggle when surrounded by lower quality/experienced team mates.  I see this all the time with Kaka, he is expecting certain runs and openings that never happen because the talent around him is no where need his level.  

Players like Kaka and Pirlo almost have to play down to their team mates a little and have more patience when things do not work out.

To see the flip side of this, just look at Gerrard at LA.  With Keene and the rest of the quality out there, Gerrard has been able to quickly adapt and contribute.  The overall quality of players for LA is higher than NYCFC and OCSC, so their quality DPs have an easier time adjusting and gelling.

Then he's lying.

False,"1.) Don't watch it if you don't want to, and, on the flip side, you can also get 2 hours of TSM vs CLG.

2.) That's honestly better for the teams who now get more competitive experience and having more games allows teams to experiment more with the meta on stage since each individual game doesn't hold as much weight as they do in 18 bo1s.

3.) That's literally a solution to the scheduling issue between NA and EU.

4.) That's not really a problem since other sports' standings are generally all over the place too since teams play different amounts of games throughout the season.

5.) There's probably a way to do bo2 without superweeks.

6.) NA also includes Canada, which has a sport (hockey) that has a point system and included ties at one point. While NHL no longer does ties, the reason was more of an issue with the game itself rather than a problem with the concept of a tie, which many hockey fans (myself included) are still fine with.


The reason Bo1 is fine in NBA/NHL is that a.) they have extensive travel, and b.) they play a lot of games. Having a lot of games mitigates the random chance of upsets since they won't happen as many times.
LPL/LCK are also a leagues, but they do bo2/bo3. Also, I'd much rather give NA and EU are better chance at beating LPL/LCK teams by changing the competition format to help them improve.

There is basic medical oversight and police guards them so they are safe. Their shelter is the fucking underpass we Budapesters use daily.

Why is it that Har HaZeitim has plenty of rock throwers and the police would rather silence people visiting graves or who came under attack? Why is it that Arabs throw rocks on Har HaBayit and spit and yell and harass people that visit, but if a Jew drinks water, they get beat up and sent to jail?

Why is it that incitement that occurs by Arabs in front of an American congressman (this was only a few weeks ago!) was permitted and tolerated but if a right-wing figure's grandson is hanging out in the middle of nowhere, he's arrested for incitement and terrorism and accused of a crime in an Arab village for which there is no evidence of such and the army openly asks for information and clues???

Why is it that Leftwing teachers can go to Arab villages to help them setup the army to look bad, so that they can provoke fights and take pictures of soldiers getting beat up while making an arrest?? Why is it that the worst he'll get is fired because the local district decides he's too publicized to keep??

Also they feared that they would be completely cutoff from the sea, or made into a German sattelite state. Hitlers claimed extra-territoriality to expand the Autobahn, that is not above and beyond. That is trying to build a road. Later in 1939, in August, the German government issued an ultimatum, and in September they attacked Poland, without a declaration of war.

The problem with Palestine is a tad more complicated. You see: When T.E. Lawrence (Yes, that Lawrence) made the muslims help against the turks in ww1, Britain promised them a state. But the same area they had allready promised themselves, and so had the French. So while France and Britain were discussing Palestine, Hitler went to war, Killed alot of Jews, shot himself, and died. Understandable the Jews did not want to stay in Europe no more, so Britain and France had an idea: Why not give the Jews the land that they could not agree on. But alot of muslims claimed the same land, with a document just as great, with the British kings name on the bottom. So now they are fighting.

Many European gods are like this.

But in truth it's deeper than that. These are beings who can't be pigeonholed easily. For instance Freja is a love goddess but a war goddess as well (her taking half of the slain on the battlefield).

False,"&gt;I have no questions about this... France and the UK are extremely close since the Entente Cordial, we have shared command structures train each others military and have a myriad of joint defense agreements culminating in the Lancaster House Treaties[1] ).

Looks great on paper. But, passing the hot potato at Calais, just over a bunch of migrants, doesn't breed confidence that Entente would be so cordial when shit hits the fan.

&gt; There are literally no indications to the contrary, Merkel has committed Germany to longterm sanctions on the Russian economy for taking a tiny peninsula with less than 2 million inhabitants.

Give me a break. Germany was corralled into semi-hard stance towards Russia by none other than USA, along with the rest of Europe. Without American pressure, Germany might just as easily say ""fuck Ukraine, wee need our gas"". 

And while Germans agreed not to export potatoes to Russia, whose ships are at a standoff with Sukhoi jets in the Black sea? Not the Deutsche Marine, last I checked. Who is providing training and weapons to Ukrainians? 

&gt; Their opinions have no impact on the actions of the big three though, it's the opinions of the citizens of the ""big three"" that does have an impact e.g. Brits (like me) Frenchies and Germans.

False,"Pretty much bang on the money.  Commonwealth is huge, but so is Scandinavia.  Thinks its Russia.  France is also swollen a bit, because when we were allied, I didn't object to it taking its own wars out on western Europe.

In terms of pure forcelimit, I can have double the Commonwealth, which in turn has double everyone else, more or less.  Its also the smallest standing army I've had for a while, more usually 200-250 regiments, with a 300-350 limit at the moment, but been fighting too much (cf Ethiopia and Persia looked tasty).  Also think I've put some on order, to deal with that spanish threat, but will check later.

The outside bets (as I don't know the mechanics) is that the Spanish colonies will try again for independence.  Considering I allied them and accepted their CTA during their last war, I feel they owe me one.  Most are at 100% liberty desire and have begun the allying process.  Hopefully should I squish a few regiments of spanish infantry, they may go for it.  

Another outside bet is France.  Don't know whether glitch or the AI has some sort of remorse, but even when under Spain in a PU, it has been remarkably friendly to me.  It does show as hostile sometimes though, which is why I posted a diplomat.  For example, even when technically an enemy/rival (because Spain is my rival), it has entered my territory, crossing it all from the west to the east, spanked some rebels for me, and then wandered off home.  It also doesn't appear to attack me unless absolutely necessary - even holding an entire army out of bounds and not attacking/invading with it when I was directly fighting them in the war of succession.  It does still register as full trust too.

Considering the last time the Spanish colonies tried to revolt, France supported them, and tried to break the PU at the same time.  Best case scenario would be if that happened again.  There is also the $64,000 question: What will Great Britain do?  They *are* allied to Scandinavia, although rivaled to me.  I *think* they have both Spain and Commonwealth rivaled though, so who knows?

Se você for pegar o desenvolvimento do debate sobre mudanças climáticas, por exemplo, desde os primórdios do Clube de Roma nos anos 1970 e a ideia de que os recursos naturais estariam se esgotando, você vai ver que o debate todo nasce tanto politicamente como cientificamente. 

Pega o IPCC, o Painel para Mudanças Climáticas da ONU. É um corpo político, certo? Formado por cientistas, mas político porque é uma agência da ONU. As pesquisas científicas que são feitas e publicadas nos melhores journals, com as metodologias adequadas, são compiladas nos relatórios que saem a cada 3 ou 4 anos. Esse material técnico não é lido por ninguém de fora da comunidade científica. Aí você tem dois resumos: o 'summary for policy makers' e o 'summary for the media'. O primeiro só é publicado depois do aval de um corpo de diplomatas, agentes políticos por natureza, sobre o que deve ou não ser publicado. 

Existem várias denúncias de mudanças de natureza política (cortes em frases controversas, por exemplo) por diplomatas americanos dentro da ONU. Aí eu te pergunto: o relatório é científico ou é político?

Acredito que pode ser chamada assim, sim. Isso significa que essa verdade não é política também ou que não é utilizada, criada, financiada e ganha ou perde destaque devido a interesses políticos?

So the fuck what? 

Marriage, as traditionally practiced in a huge range of cultures **was mutual ownership**.

No other woman owned the man other than his wife, no other man owned the woman other than her husband.

Each was the other's only - - only sexual partner, only emotional confidant, only partner in making a home, only partner in raising and nurturing/providing for children.

We **still** have no semantic means of discussion interpersonal relationship without using possessives, gender aside.

""This is my car.""

""She is *my* girlfriend.""

Ella is mi novia

She is *my* girlfriend.

Which is your car? 

Who is *your* girlfriend? 

Cual es su auto? 

Quien es *su* novia? 

Это моя машина 'Eta moya maschina'

This is *my* car.

Это моя девушка. 'Eta moya deyvushka'

This is *my* girlfriend.

Какой ваш автомобиль? 'Kakov vash automobile?'

Кто твоя девушка? 'kto *tvoya* devushka'

The entirety of Indo-European languages work like this.

And you know what? despite the personal possessives conjugating in the front ""yAmi""/""umkAmi"", ""yAkho""/""umkhakho"", it's the same in freaking Zulu.

First of all, the tone of the book: it is melodramatic and pompous. Minor accomplishments are presented as grand victories, but I am not a layman, so I felt it as a contrast and an appeal to emotions without enough ground for it.

The book is more a biography of oncologists rather than cancer itself. There are many anecdotes about their lives and quite some stuff about how the first cancer research funding campaign were born. I think it would be of some interest to researchers and clinicians, but I can't say how helpful it would be for laymen unless they enjoy biographies. If you are interested in what actually is cancer and how our understanding of it changed along the years, well... you won't find it there.

There are also some glaring omissions... The book focuses almost esclusively on chemotherapy and united states. There is not much about surgery and even less about radiology, and it loks like Europe did nothing for cancer research.

The new map needs to be adjusted so fighting for the objectives is more fair. They should make it a more sky temple approach to it, having to stand on it instead of this last hit approach. Also the arcane boss is faaarrrr too powerful compared to the others. It's frustrating when your team finally gets a boss and it spawns a weaker mortar boss you absolutely get no value from. The first boss is also far too strong. The team that gets the first objective usually gets at least 1,5 level lead which is really hard to comeback from because the 2nd objective spawns not much later. It is impossible to close the cap in such a short time. They really need to rework this map, it feels like a broken snowball map. I have 2,5k games played and rank 1 on EU.

Your assumption is that all these local bike shops are running to the bank and converting USD to CAD.  I doubt that.  I think US stores will want to pay with currency they hold, USD.  Regardless, if the market rate is $600 USD, and before Cervelo was getting $400 USD, I am sure they will gladly pick up the extra $200 and Vroomen and White will both buy bigger houses or something.  

In the OP economics example, what is important is if *due to exchange rate* the product is priced out.  Which Cervelo and Argon are not priced out since I see all sorts of people riding them.  Now they *could* lower the price but it does not mean they will.  So I think it will come down to brand specific decisions. At least in the case of Cervelo they might not follow normal microeconomics rules as they are likely to be thought of as a luxury brand and lowering the price could harm their brand.  Also lowering the price will increase demand which may exceed their capacity to produce them creating shortages.  You have to get pretty advanced in economics to start thinking about capacity on the back end.  Argon I don't know well enough to know if they get a ""luxury"" tag but they to might face capacity limitations.   

Again, I assume they would *want* USD and not CAD in their hands.  They can trade USD with Japan and many other countries.  I'm sure they can do it in CAD but USD is more usable in the world market.

False,"Here's a good empirical example for you: the US and Canada.  Canada as a policy matter allows in far more immigrants than the US.  The US admits about 1 million permanent residents a year,^1 and Canada about 250,000.^2  Given that Canada's population is about 1/10th that of the US, that translates to Canada allowing in immigrants at 2.5x the per capita rate of the US.

As such, Canada has a substantially higher portion of its population as immigrants.^3  20.7% immigrant population in Canada, versus 14.3% for the USA.

Canadian immigrants are also a highly diverse lot.^4  The large majority come from non-western countries, with only 38,000 out of 260,000 last year coming from the US or Europe.

So how is Canada doing compared to the US?  Just fine.  Crime is lower on a broad variety of metrics.^5  GDP per capita is also very similar.^6  And Canadians enjoy a very comparable quality of life to Americans.  

Canada admits a lot of immigrants, and has an absolutely huge immigrant population, moreso than the US.  And Canada is a great country to live in.  

Culturally and historically, the US and Canada are about as similar as two countries can be.  If Canada does not suffer from high immigration levels as compared to the US, it provides a strong case study that the causation you posit existing does not in fact exist.

False,"Modified from an [earlier answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3i6lg0/was_germany_onboard_with_the_japanese_plan_to/)

Although it was in many respects a foolish blunder in hindsight, there was a lot of strategic calculation that went into German declaration of war on the United States. Hitler and the Germans did not so much see the declaration of war as the start of a *quid quo pro* process with Japan leading to a Japanese invasion of Siberia, but rather an opportunity to gain time and militarily isolate the United States by giving German armed forces a free hand in the Atlantic and encourage the Japanese to keep fighting in the Pacific.   

Both Hitler and German military planners were not on board with the bombing of Pearl Harbor itself mostly because they were completely ignorant of Japanese the scale and extent of Japanese planning. Although the Japanese occupation of French Indochina and the resulting US blockade of strategic raw materials  made it apparent that war in the Pacific was imminent, German leaders were in the dark about future military operations. Two days before Pearl Harbor, the German Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop actually hoped that America would be the one to instigate military aggression against Japan. 

Von Ribbentrop's thoughts on the situation in the Pacific was emblematic of much of German geostrategic thought in the winter of 1941. The actions of the USN in the Battle of the Atlantic in which US ships jettisoned most pretensions of neutrality indicated that the US was readying to enter into the war. Although an expansion of the war carried with it new uncertainties, a number of German military planners mistakenly concluded that Japan's entry into the was in the Pacific was largely beneficial to Germany's strategic interests. 

Part of this miscalculation stemmed from the dire situation Germany had found itself in at the end of 1941. Although Barbarossa had achieved spectacular gains, the German invasion had not achieved the desired result of a complete collapse of the Soviets. The strengthening Soviet resistance and counterattacks was a bitter pill for the Germans to swallow. Moreover, the strengthening of the British military position in North Africa and the Atlantic seemed to threaten German-occupied Europe's southern and western flanks. German planners hoped that Japanese conquests in East Asia and the Central Pacific would rectify this global strategic balance by forcing both the British and Americans to reorient their military resources to the Pacific. An OKW strategic assessment produced on 14 December outlined their expectations for the British response: 

&gt;Securing her position in the Middle East has gained even greater importance for Britain since Japan's entry into the war-not only because of the Persian and Mesopotamian oil, on which the British navy in the Indian Ocean must depend once the oil wells of Borneo and Sumatra are lost to it, but also because of the especially important maintenance of sea communications through the Suez Canal and because of the air communications, based upon this region, between the mother country and India, East Asia, and Australia. Execution of this strategic task will no doubt be seen by Britain to be just as vital as the maintenance of her Indian-Malayan position, which is crucial for the safeguarding of India, Australia, and New Zealand. 

In OKW's estimation, the Japanese conquest of SE Asian rubber, tin, and oil sources would deprive the British and Americans, and by extension the Soviets, of this strategic war material. The *Kriegsmarine*, facing its first serious reversals in the Battle of the Atlantic and Mediterranean, welcomed the thought that both the RN and USN meeting the Japanese naval challenge would give German and Italian naval forces time to regroup. The declaration of war gave the *Kriegsmarine* a free hand to attack American shipping without as much interference from the USN and RN. According to the Naval Staff's estimation, expanding the war would divide Allied naval power, which prior to Pearl Harbor was in seeming danger of uniting.  

Underlying this German enthusiasm for Japanese belligerence was the hope that the Japanese would present enough of a strategic diversion to allow German military forces to complete the job in the USSR they had begun the previous June. The defeat of the USSR remained the main strategic priority for Germany military planning. Only the *Kriegsmarine* evinced any great interest for a grand military hookup with the Japanese in India. Although both the Navy and von Ribbentrop urged Hitler to agree to a joint Axis declaration on India, the German leader refused on the grounds that such an anticolonial measure was not in the strategic interests of Germany. Hitler held out hopes that an anti-Churchill faction would come to the fore once Stalin had been beaten and threatening India would supposedly undercut support for a separate peace.  OKW began in 1942 tentative plans for a wider invasion of the Middle East, but only after the success of Blue's offensive in the Caucasus.  

Hitler's declaration of war on America gave German military much greater latitude to plan for a western defensive barrier. Expanding the war would also cow the various neutrals on Germany's flanks (Turkey, Spain, and Sweden) to accede to German demands. German entry into the war on Japan's side would also prevent the latter from making a separate peace prematurely. This was in keeping with the Third Reich's strategic thinking with regards to the Anglo-American powers in that it was in German interests to keep them preoccupied outside of areas controlled by Germany.  OKW's 14 December report claimed the prognosis for the following year good for these four reasons:

&gt; I) Within the period left to it before the full mobilization of the American war machine, Germany would reach its military objectives in the east, in the Mediterranean, and in the Atlantic.

&gt; II) Germany would succeed, by political means, not only in inducing its allies to intensify their war efforts, but also in securing the periphery by bringing the flanking powers-hitherto neutral-of Turkey, Spain, Portugal, and Sweden into the continental defensive bloc.

&gt; III) The Japanese offensive would have enough endurance and momentum to tie down a substantial part of the Anglo-American potential in the Pacific for a considerable time.  
    
&gt;IV) Under these circumstances the United States would not be able to conduct an offensive two-ocean war in the foreseeable future.

The experience of 1942 would prove each of these suppositions unduly optimistic. In short, the Germans believed that they possessed both the time and the resources to meet the new strategic challenge. They fundamentally underestimated America's industrial capabilities and overestimated the ability of Japan to act as a sink for Anglo-American resources. Even more fatally, both Hitler and OKW overestimated both Germany's own ability to deliver a fatal blow in Operation Blue and their chances of securing their strategic flanks with secondary forces like DAK and the *Kriegsmarine*. 

In a minor defense of German planners, there were some kernels of truth underneath their strategic delusions. The loss of Southeast Asian rubber sources initially was a source of considerable consternation to Anglo-American planners. But synthetic rubber, recycling, and African and Latin American rubber plantations were able to minimize the effect of such losses upon the Allied war effort. The German's confidence in their Japanese allies' ability to hold the Pacific in part stemmed from the Japanese themselves. The German naval attache in Japan had received unprecedented access into the IJN's construction programs, including the new *Yamato*-class superbattleships that were to beat American quantity with quality. Finally, the Germans estimated that it would take time for the Americans to make the full weight of its armaments known on the European continent. German experience in the First World War had shown them that the US took a considerable time to mobilize both its vast population and industry for wartime. Although American preparations for war were much further along in 1941 than they were in 1917, it was not until 1943/44 that the quantity of American arms had really begun to make itself felt on Europe.

1441250232,"So, throughout all (yes, all six, you babies) of the Star Wars movies, we are led to believe that ""Jedi"" = ""good"" and ""Sith""/""Empire"" = ""bad"". Now if the ""prophecy"" revealed in Episode I about Anakin being the chosen one to bring balance to the force is true, and we consider all of Anakin's actions before his death, that means ""bringing balance to the force"" included the absolute destruction of the Jedi Order via Order 66 + personal murder of Obi-Wan, but *also* the destruction of the Sith, via murder of the Emperor. This suggests that leaving Luke the sole remaining Jedi in the universe at the end of ROTJ *is* bringing balance to the force.

What this suggests is that Jedi and Sith are not clear cut as good and bad at all, and in fact there's some merit to this, because the Jedi are incredibly stifled, almost robotic, in their operations. They cannot love, or marry, or have children, which is not only one of the most human desires, but also the literal purpose of life. By forbidding it, the Jedi Order actually reveals itself to be just as shortsighted as the Sith, but erring on the side of ""too much logic"" rather than ""too much emotion"". The Jedi were not ""good guys"" by default, they were a criticism of stifling bureaucratic overly-logical procedure, ignoring the desires and mistakes of innate humanity. Just because the heroes happened to be on that side of the conflict (arguable, since Anakin Skywalker is one of the heroes of the story, albeit a fallen one), doesn't make them ""the good guys"".

All this implies that Luke is forging a ""middle path"" for a new Jedi Order that will avoid the mistakes of either of the sects overthrown over the course of the movies...

...which, I believe, is a deliberate callback to Qui-Gon, who was the only rational voice against the Jedi Order *and* the Sith during the time he was alive. It's also heavily implied that Qui-Gon is the one who discovered the secret of becoming a Force-ghost (later taught to Obi-Wan and Yoda, also implied), which gives his philosophy a bit more validity than those of his peers at the time.

What I'm getting at here is that all of this is speculation and not explored by the movies in very much depth at all. I would've liked more explanation of the moral dubiousness of the Jedi, and why their destruction was just as beneficial for the balance of the Force as the destruction of the Sith. I also would like more insight into the FIRST middle path philosophy, the one that Qui-Gon subscribed to when the Jedi Order in Episode I was at its peak.

In fact THEY VOTED for the constitution that made it a theocracy, and THEY ARE DOING WELL under their system of government. They regularly participate in their elections too

So? Like it is a popularity contest? Like those countries themselves can't be accused of backing terrorists ? How many nun-raping death squads has the US let loose in Latin America? Israel regularly terrorizes Palestinian refugees yet HAMAS is the terrorist?


FYI Hamas exists because out of the 1.3 million people in Gaza, 1 million are REFUGEES who have been gathered up and forced to live in a concentration camp there, while Israel stole their lands.

False,"&gt;What are the platforms of the various parties? 

Conservatives: Broadly centre-right- In terms of UK policies they are committed to reducing the national debt, and shrinking the size of the state through privatisation and reducing welfare. Otherwise they generally maintain the status-quo, and oppose further integration with Europe. 

Labour: The main opposition party, wherever they will be a centralist or left wing party remains to be seen as they are having a leadership election. Generally Labour support public services and helping poorer members of society. 

As for the smaller parties, the LibDems are liberally social, pro-European and pro-freemarket but don't explictly endorse shrinking the welfare state. UKIP are more or less specifically in favour of the UK leaving the EU, the Greens are basically a left wing, pro-environmental party. National parties like the SNP and Plyd Cymru basically tend to be centre-left parties who advocate the independence of their countries.

&gt;Is the majority of your leaders elected or appointed? 

Political parties appoint their leader- this is done in various ways- either through election by their party members or by the party MP's. A party leader then becomes Prime Minister if their party wins the most seats in Parliament in the General Election.

&gt;How do the various branches of government work?

Political parties in the the House of Commons (legislature) propose laws- this is checked by the House of Lords (the upper house of the legislature basically) and rubber-stamped by the Queen. Our executive is basically the Prime Minister and his Cabinet of senior MP's- they make ""official"" legislation of the government and are mostly able to pass it though Parliament but rebel MP's and opposition in the Lords can make that problematic. Our judiciary is the courts, who basically interpret and enforce the laws parliament passes.   ",cuo6llk,t3_3jcte2,,0,t3_3jcte2,t5_2qhcv,0,1444128649,5,5,,,ukpolitics,Battle_Biscuits,1441206169

Great condition, literally worn once. 270 degree handwelted (according to Sagara), looks fantastic, no real flaws. Double leather sole, vintage cats paw heel. These are a **size 47D, 13US, 12UK**. They are a bit big on me as I am a 12 D/E Brannock, but fit alright with an insole. They'd probably fit well for a 12.5E or 13D brannock.

Would probably fit a 11.5D brannock or small 12 well. They have only been worn inside for a couple hours, basically brand new. b Store is a fashion house and do a lot of Opening Ceremony's shoe designs. These were around 400-500$ originally.

False,"""They told me not to go.

The other guardians who made up my fireteam were there in the hanger lounge with me when I made my decision. I'd been to Luna, Venus, all the way to Mars and the Reef. There was one place I'd never investigated, though. When I told them my intentions, they thought I was joking. Then they realized I was serious.

'You can't go back there, man.'

'There's nothing to see.'

'You'll be broken by it. You gotta not think about it.'

'It will change you. You won't like that change.'

'Forget what they said. You should go anyway.'

We hunters are used to traveling through rough territory. The European Deadzone is a sketchy place. You see the same amount of death and destruction on Luna, Venus, Mars... Of all the places I've been, not a one has been even remotely pleasant. So what did I expect to find? I dunno. You tell me.

I took the long way around. More scenic. My jumpship skimmed through the clouds above a barren India. Made a pass through the Middle East; Dubai was a mess that I really don't want to talk about. Continued on into the Deadzone, saw what might have once been an impressive tower in France, now skeletons littered the ground around its bent frame. I saw the same things everywhere I went: cars piled up on the highways, other wrecked cosmodromes from which only the lucky few left Earth. Big Ben was still in London, only the face of the clock now stared at the sky as if wanting to leave and there were bodies in the rubble beneath it.

The Atlantic was a calming sight. Looking at the water below and the sky above helped prepare me for what was to come. When I hit the Manhattan Nuclear Zone, the sky wasn't blue anymore.

I can't tell you what I saw there. It's the kind of thing that needs to be seen to be understood. It was an important moment for me though: it was the moment when I finally admitted my fireteam was right.

The house still stood where it used to. The grass had not been mowed in a very, very long time, and the nearby river was now a dry bed where more plant life had grown in. My jumpship dropped me off in the front yard, and as I waded through the tall grass I heard a sound. It was distant, but it was there.

The door was open and no one was home. There were holes in the floor and you could drop right through into the basement. The basement once was the only thing that scared me about this place. Now the entire house felt like the basement: old and dead and empty. I found what I came for and left as quickly as I could.

Not quick enough. Three Fallen skiffs pulled in overhead and began unloading their cargo, ether blades buzzing in the afternoon air like cicadas, except the trees were gone and not an insect moved for miles. Three captains descended to confront me with their crews. In my left hand I clutched my prize, in my right my piece appeared, glowing gold and burning with fury.

Each captain took a shot, each captain staggered a little and growled at me, 1, 2, 3. The fire in my gun died down but the sounds that erupted from it now would be enough; they would drown out the ether and make holes in the ones who hunted me, who I now blamed for everything. Bodies under Big Ben. Skeletal French tower and Manhattan nuclear winter. The Burj Khalifa was a vertical graveyard.

When I left home for the last time the bodies were still warm and there was a burnt smell on the air. I waited until I was over the ocean again before opening the cockpit of my jumpship slowly and tearing my discovery to pieces, letting them float away on the wind. My ghost never asked who the people in the photo were, and I never talked about it until now. I wonder if he knew.""",cuo7r8v,t3_3jcbo4,,0,t3_3jcbo4,t5_2vq0w,0,1444129194,10,10,,,DestinyTheGame,Kayar13,1441208041

False,"For ease of understanding, I'll use ""race"" to mean a division of species with its own set of subspecies, etc. and not a division of ethnicities or minor physical variation.

In my own world, or at least the one I'm using for this example and setting system aside completely, I avoided the monolithic race example in 4 ways: choosing an often overlooked source for races; modifying said race based on ideas of exaggerated accounts; including subdivisions of said species for certain traits; and removing specific cultural references from race itself.

To combat conflict of bias over presentation, I also named these races using interpretations or references in old Saxon and Old Norse, eschewing standard naming conventions so as to have that extra step of separation (also to make the material more consistent and immersive), making exceptions only when doing so caused great confusion without creating a different identity for the race than what is already familiar.

**Overlooked Sources:** I went straight to folklore for the inspiration of my races. Obviously, I'm not the first to do this, but I see it is far more common when populating worlds to use the standard fantasy paradigms established largely by Tolkein (prevalence of orcs, for example). Since ""folklore"" covers a very, very large expanse of concepts, some of which cross-culturally overlap, it's a particularly good base for inspiration. For the particular areas in my world that I focus on, I largely use various European and Middle-Eastern folklores to narrow it down.

**Modifying Races:** Once I chose the races I would allow at first (the list expanded later), I took a look at what stood out in the folklore and then divided traits into ""likely to be accurate"" and ""likely to be exaggerated"", as accounts would no doubt deviate from the real thing. This of course done using my world and its limits and not the real world. I pared off or made reasonable sources for the exaggerations (propaganda or misunderstanding) and fleshed out the accurate descriptions.

**Variation of Physical Traits:** I created physical subspecies for every race. If a race were newer or geographically limited, there would be fewer subspecies, but at this point in the world any playable race is unlikely to be without subspecies unless they are endangered/near extinction. These subspecies may actually have traits that the parent species lacks overall, and if so they are adaptations selected for advantage in their primary environment/climate.

**Culture:** Culture is not racial. It comes from the intersection of religion or lack thereof, local identity, and identity within a largely society. As such, race doesn't affect the priorities, focus, cultural proclivities, and so on of a given character, though it may be a factor in shaping some of these concepts as systemic racial oppression does exist in many (nearly all) of the different states, though the particular targets for that oppression change from state to state (I don't call them nations because the timeframe of my world is prior to the concept of nation states) and from region to region.",cuo7u1c,t3_3jbywk,,0,t3_3jbywk,t5_2rd6n,0,1444129230,2,2,,,worldbuilding,leth-caillte,1441208164
