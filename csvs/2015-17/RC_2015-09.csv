your system (and i just ran a simulation bracket) **completely** misses the point of worlds. worlds is *supposed* to be region vs region to determine, of all regions, which team is the best. in the current system, you are forcing different regions to face other regions in matches; the strongest region will win *regardless* of the system, but riot's worlds format allows for more diversity.

your system ends up with a lot of (if not mostly, depending on pool) in-region matches, which is a **huge waste of time**. the whole point of the individualized region games (LCS NA, LCS EU, LCK, LMS, etc) is to determine which teams in their respective regions are the best among them. we already did that; we don't need to do it again and waste time in group stages.

All-Stars will be after worlds which is probably the tournament you mean with that phrase, MSI didn't replace All-Stars, its whole new tourney.

The reason why I used MSI as and example is because its the latest international tournament, even if its only best teams from each regions, its the best most recent piece of info we can get, but I actually would rather have just more expanded worlds tourney.

For example, have couple more pools, so we could have few more best of fives and also we wouldn't need to cut out wildcards and we could have 3rd seed for LMS too and maybe even add more seeds to the better regions.

I do think that both NA and EU deserves 3 seeds, maybe if LMS keeps doing as well as they have done recently, they should get 3rd seed aswell and same thing with KR/CN, if they keep doing as good as they've done so far, they could get 4th seeds, but tourney would need to be bigger in that case and then there wouldnt be reason to cut out IWC or 3rd seeds from NA or EU.

If the US shrinks the DoD budget, they shrink their power projection capabilities and in turn that means their ability to act as ""world police"".    

As the US shrinks their military and military capabilities they'll also shrink their ""global responsibilities"" as a result meaning someone out there is going to have to pick up the tab and fill in the shoes as it were.    

This would mean one or two things, those with the budget will have to increase *their* military spending to defend their interests, trade routes, oil import/export that sort of thing. If the US withdraws from it's current role the other possibility is someone else will fill it rather than having it equally divided, so with that who would be the ""prefered"" de facto superpower the US, Russia or China.    

If one thinks about it the US military and it's budget is disproportionately large, and for example Europe's is disproportionately small.    

If the former happens (and only the former) everyone is at equal footing, inevitably a country somewhere will have issues with another country sooner or later. They will try to reach an agreement without violence, some may succeed but that's not a guarantee, and when a disagreement does happen and talks break down other countries will take sides, there's no way to be certain how effective organizations like the UN and NATO would be without the preeminent world power backing it. It's a recipe for a powder keg our predecessors are all to familiar with I'm afraid.    

Now here's the kicker... if it wasn't the US, it might very well have been the USSR, if not the USSR it could have been the PRC decades down the line in some bizarro timeline where neither the USSR or US had massive spheres of influence. The US can't back down from it's current position on the world stage by itself, it needs it's allies to pick up the slack before hand or everything will turn to hell in a handbasket but countries don't want to spend when someone is willing to pick up the tab, and also the US military industrial complex doesn't want it's prime customer to spend less.",cumj52i,False

First off I'll say thanks for educating me about the Swedes Danes and Norwegians, I knew they were interconnected, but had no idea it went back that far... and I ended up looking it up myself. So seriously thanks for having a civil conversation and educating me.

I will say though that German is a very small minority region in Belgium though, my grandfather was from Wallonia, so I have looked up that country extensive and I know French and Dutch are the main languages there with a very tiny German minority. Canada has a higher percentage of Mandarin speakers than Germans in Belgium, so I wouldn't really say German is important to Belgium.

I forgot about Austria and Germany though, I know the Bavarian region  of the two countries is like basically the exact same culture.

The Scots spoke a different language than England, and are only associated because England basically oppressed them.

Here are my counter arguments.

Canada and America when being colonized were basically the same in the border regions, there was no defined area, so the two countries were founded by the exact same people.

The two countries, prior to European colonization, were populated by Native's whose nation/tribal borders spanned both Canada and the U.S.A, the Six Nations is still a tribal nation that consists of Canadians and American natives. So for thousands of years prior to Europe, Canada and America were the exact same, populated by the same people, who lived on both sides of the non-existent border. So technically the two countries have been connected by the people who colonized it since they've had people living there.
I am talking about the border regions, Southern U.S and Northern Canada are two very different places.

A lot of American cities were founded by Canadians; especially French Canadians, Detroit and a lot of Michigan used to be part of Canada, Detroit is a French word; De trois riviere is the origin. All the way down to Louisiana and the Gulf coast, you will find peoples whose ancestors are Canadian and towns that were founded by Canadians.

A lot of Canadian towns were founded by American loyalists. After the revolution Canada was basically given a ""jolt"" of development by Americans moving into Canada, who brought everything with them. Canada essentially was founded by Amerians, I don't think Scotland can say that about the English......etc.

Both our nations are far away from other influences, Europe is distant to us, we have developed our own ""North American"" way of living which is basically the exact same as eachother; minus Religion and demographics. 

Canada still is relatively religious compared to the most of Europe, and about 40 years ago Canada and the U.S were the exact same on the religion front, both were founded by puritans Brits.

Both countries were founded by the same source countries, therefore we have been interconnected for centuries because Canadian heritage and American heritage both meet in Europe from the same countries. The only exception is Canada has a lot more French heritage, but America still has a lot of French heritage too, all the border regions of Maine and Vermont with Canada have French-Canadian towns that are in the U.S. 

Most non-North Americans cannot tell the difference between a Canadian and an American, they literally are the most confused nations on Earth, there is no dead give away even to native English speakers. Canadians sound the most like Americans, and I think the two accents are the most similar accents on Earth.

This is the biggest factor, all those European countries you mentioned can do trade with other nations, can travel to other nations, and have influence from other nations quiet easily.

Canada and the U.S are very isolated, and only have eachother; yes the U.S southwest has Mexico but I'm talking about the hearts of both countries which is in the North East. 

We only have eachother, we have developed isolated with eachother, and I think that makes our relationship more unique than any other countries. Both of us depend on eachother heavily for trade, and there isn't a larger undefended border on Earth. 

But you do make a good point, I just think all those other countries are in the ""mesh"" that is Europe, and are too influenced from eachother too much to even consider them to be similar to Canada/U.S.A. You just can't find two countries that take up an entire continent by themselves on the planet, and that creates a very unique social cohesion. 

Anything that is created by Americans is basically immediately adopted by Canadians, and Americans embrace Canadian culture the most openly too.

I know Austrians like to be separate from Germans, and so do Canadians from Americans, but Canadians and Americans are both proud of North America as a whole and don't mind referring to the two countries as a whole. I know for a fact Austrians would never want to say they are ""European"" as a whole, and be proud of all of Europe. 

Europe is full of love-hate relationships, when Canada and America basically just love eachother. The first visit a president takes to another country is to Canada always, same with our Prime Minister. We are sister nations from the same mother, there are no other sister nations right next to eachother geographical outside of the Americas, Australia, and the U.K and New Zealand are all very far from eachother. Like I said I can be in the U.S within an hour and a half if I wanted.  

It's hard to explain, I get where you are coming from, but I really feel that Canadians and Americans are the exact same people, and we don't mind admitting that, I don't think there are two countries in Europe like that.

To me Argentina and Uruguay are the closest thing to a Canada/ America relationship on Earth.",cumkvyb,1441074072

Ninja edit: Despite what everyone may say. /u/Moruitelda brings up a lot of good points. But I still have to disagree. Fred Jackson has never been an amazing player for us. He was often injured and got old. Even in his early years, he didn't put up amazing stand-out numbers. He was always second to Thurman. 

But that's not what's important here. Stats, touchdowns, fame, it's not what mattered with Fred Jackson. I'll reiterate what many people have said before this. He was the shining light in a vast dark, and empty world that was Buffalo. He gave us a reason to believe. Not because he was a star. Or a rookie prospect. He didnt get us to the superbowl, nor the playoffs. He gave us hope. He did it because he was the blue collar representation that of the Bills. He worked from the ground to here and never let up.

Everyone is praising the moves we made during the transfer window, and while I admit it was good to cut out the dead weight, not replacing it with anything of substance is like removing a cancer, and doing none of the recommended treatment afterwards. because you think your body will naturally heal.

With the squad we have at present, we are hardly going to be challenging the league, and possibly not even making back into European competitions. We can blame player mentality, having  new coach, or a million different things that will pop up. 

And while many of them will be valid, the problem lies with our lack of depth. If a player has a bad game, or god forbid an injury, we are out of luck in many positions. Unless we make some big moves in the Jan. window, we are looking at around 6th place. Because a lot of teams around us *have* been making signings.

Sure Adriano and Bacca are decent players, but we look at some of the people coming in for other teams I just kind of shake my head, preparing for this next season. We needed something bigger than the whimper of a window we just had. Just because it wasn't bad doesn't mean it was good.

A smokescreen. You think teams move up and down in Europe due to good coaching and player development? Please. Unless you're a yo-yo club, a big club that goes belly-up or a small club that gets an angel investment from someone with nothing better to do with his money, there is very little promoting and relegating in European soccer. The clubs find the levels they're best suited for and that's where they stay. TSG Hoffenheim didn't earn their way into the Bundesliga with good coaching.

They got relegated because their owners financially ruined the team, just like Chivas USA's owners did.

If you're a good player on a lower level team, you don't stick around and help that team get promoted. You get bought by a premier level team. If you're a bad player on a top level team, you don't drag the team down and potentially get them relegated. You get loaned out or outright sold to a lower level team. The only people in Europe that truly get promoted and relegated on a large scale are players, not teams. Sounds an awful lot like a minor-league system. The difference is that the pro/rel system holds the lure of a big payday for lower level clubs who buy their way into the premier division and the specter of financial death for teams in the top division who don't spend enough money to stay in the top.

Russia was cold back then, the climate different, the ice not yet melted - pretty in its own way, but no Tango Lake. I watched broken men beat factory metal, watched broken women sleep in huddles for bread-less breadlines, watched the secret meetings around copper samovars and crumpled pamphlets. 

Some offenders ticked for Hitler first, some for Aradabi. Time travel was far removed from the context of the Cold War and I rarely saw a face in the dark, but it was nonetheless a grim shift. The kind of players I saw were the twisted ones, the ones who had spent some time in the Mirk and realized that it was a similar dark to the one that pounded behind sleepless eyes. The kind of players I saw were the ones who figured that they could skip the whole damn joke and end the human story in nuclear hell. 

But today it was quiet, my wristwatch ticked away and Stalin drank tea right on schedule. Half past something and Lenin dined with Russell. A quarter till and the Iron Curtain raised its shady hand over Eastern Europe; all was well. 

It was a two day stretch in the Mirk for me to watch all the necessary bits. You don't get much to do, nothing distracting - no cards, no complex machines, nothing to let an offender slip through your net. Though, there was so much to watch, so many lifetime length movies, so many mundane events played in epic scales that entertainment was superfluous. 

They wanted you to get attached to your marks; fine. 

Sometimes that's hard. No one came out of the Aradabi play without a cold take on the human condition. The Hitler isn't much better, but at least the bad guys lost that one. Me? I've watched Stalin's life twenty eight times. I know why he wore a cross, even as an atheist. I know why he preferred mint tea over black tea. Hell, I know why he was paranoid as fuck, but that one was my fault. 

Still, I never got attached to him. I'd take a bullet for the guy, but it was just business. 

Maybe not. Maybe they were right, and the whole order of things depended on me doing my job well. In a way, I supposed that was true. If the human race ended on August 5th, 1974, then the seven hundred and fifty thousand residents of Earth 2665 would never be. That's my wife, my kid, me, and the dog gone the way of the ice caps. 

The power of it though, that was intoxicating. Fuck the offenders, I could slip from the Mirk any time, find seven pretty ladies and strangle them in their sleep and cripple the Allied scientific force in its womb. Alternatively, I could... Jesus. 

I could do it myself. I could reach through five thousand and eighty points in space-time, flick five thousand and eighty switches and blow the whole thing. 

The Mirk shimmered around me, the up and below and all around flickering to show me dusty rooms filled with blinking lights and chrome switches. My hand twitched. I laughed around the cigar and the images vanished. 

The power was enchanting, true, but Christ this place was depressing. 

I heard a door open, and the Mirk went black. A ray of light spilled over my face and I threw up a hand to shield my eyes. 

""Shifts up,"" he said. 

I grabbed my coat and walked through the door.

It's irrelevant as to how the Israelis view the conflict (as I am well aware), if in fact the narrative is inaccurate. Every government that ever existed found its own justifications. The only sound reasoning you gave to defend this narrative is that ""well this is how they view it."" Next, you didn't even attempt to justify the reasoning behind this narrative and completely ignored my response.

Of course every country  considers their own interests as more important, but I think there is something you're not comprehending. Simply claiming that you're preferring your interests over the interests of others does not make your interests correct. *Israel's entire narrative is completely revolved around her interests and as such doesn't evaluate the situation properly.* Take for example the settlements. In Israel's distorted worldview, they are legitimate. Though every other state, including the Untied States has stipulated on their illegitimacy, or illegality. There are several other parts of Israel's narrative that are only proclaimed by her. It is nothing more than propaganda used to legitimize otherwise illegal, discriminatory, violent, or unjust policies. 

Perhaps the easiest way to view the conflict is to take a step back and ask ourselves *what is the nature of the conflict?* History is important. The conflict didn't start with the 1948 war, the Suez crisis in 1956, nor did it start with the occupation. The conflict started about a century ago with complex, unresolved problems imposed on the region by imperialist French and British powers; carving up the Ottoman Empire and creating nation-states for their own interests. So essentially the conflict became a Zionist project in colonizing the land (""Jewish as England is English""), against the wishes of those already living there. Claiming that Israel is a settler-state is a simple fact. In which case, very few would argue that a settler state is morally acceptable, although most of those who argue that contradict themselves since they only apply it to this specific case for political reasons. Though even if that's the case, we must recognize the Zionist project is probably the very last colonization movement to get off the ground as it occurred during the end of the colonial period. Today colonization and colonialism are recognized as crimes against humanity. This is obvious through the decolonization doctrine among other moral values that are held in the 21st century. 

You also claim that you had ""*one factual error*"", but let's see if that's even true. I didn't even bother going over the inaccuracy in your statements. 

&gt;Israelis don't see the occupied territories as being ""Palestine"". 

This argument is completely flawed and illogical. First it is an unfounded opinion that only Israel truly believes. Nobody - not even the United States - considers the occupied Palestinian territories to not be Palestinian, nonetheless they nobody considered it to be Israeli. This is a distorted worldview that only Israel holds. 

Next, it also assumes that an ultranationalist settler-colonialist movement somehow has more rights to a territory than those already living there; in the 21st century nonetheless. 

Furthermore, the modern nation-state system that exists today in the Middle East was imposed only in the 20th century due to French/British interests. Practically every single state that exists in the Middle East today didn't exist until sometime in the 20th century. Does that mean the Zionist goals could have equally been applied to Iraq, Yemen, Transjordan or Egypt? After all, those mandates didn't have independence either. Technically the only reason Transjordan was not included to any ""Jewish homeland"" is due to the interests of imperial Britain. Basically your argument rests on imperialism, applying European type thinking to the Middle East, and claim laid out by a settler-colonialism.

These are just some of the flaws in that argument.

&gt;that the idea of a Palestine is more of a reaction against the idea of Israel and Jordan than anything else

This is disturbing reasoning as to why Palestinian nationalism should be suppressed. It does not matter if Palestinian nationalism came in response to Zionist goals. Moreover we must remember that the British did initially promise the Arabs in Palestine independence, and then even violated their own covenant (in which Britain and the League of Nations defined). The principle of Article 22 wasn't applied to Palestine. 

&gt;when Jordan controlled that land, when the world didn't necessarily call it ""occupied territories"", 

You're wrong again. The world did consider Jordan's as an occupying power. This is further proven by the fact that almost every country refused to recognize Jordan's annexation of the West Bank (only 2 or 3 countries recognized the annexation). 

&gt;and in fact maintained that they wanted their land back with no intention of creating an independent Palestine into the early 1990's

As already previously mentioned, Jordan had relinquished its claim to the territory in 1988.

&gt;They captured the land in a fundamentally defensive war that was instigated by their adversaries.

I'd only agree with this if it hadn't been Israel consistently violating the armistice agreements, encroaching on demilitarized zone, particularly in Syria; in which Israel went as far to not communicate with the commission, expelled Syrians living in the zone, and even started to build in it. Not to mention Israel had attacked Syria the month prior to the 1967 war, attacked all the way into Damascus, and had even attacked Jordan the year prior.

Let's not forget the developments that lead to what happened in 1967. Israel's policies pretty much lead to it. In fact it was Israel's consistent violations with Syria that finally lead Nasser to create a defense pact with Syria (otherwise he would have looked weak amongst the Arab world). Besides that Israel had even refused to ever allow the peace keeping forces on her side of the border with Egypt in 1967, or any year prior.

Furthermore, Israel in 1967 attacked first. Israel was not responding to an attack on her territory which by definition isn't an act of self-defense. 

&gt;Some of the land, especially the hill region, is of high strategic military and natural resource value (water). Some of the land, especially Jerusalem, is of high cultural value (and Jerusalem was a majority Jewish city before Zionism, until it was 'ethnically cleansed' of jews by the arabs in 1948).

Just because Israel wants to be a thief and exploit resources, and steal land doesn't a mean it is a sound reason. The entire world already rejected this reasoning. Israel is an occupying power and as such is not allowed to annex any part of the territory.

Your argument becomes even more ridiculous when you mention that Israel wants to keep Jerusalem because prior to 1948 the city had a Jewish majority. Though by that logic you ignore that the entirety of Palestine was majority Palestinian prior to the ethnic cleansing that took place in 1948. I think it's needless to say that the argument is extremely contradictory.

&gt;replaced by Hamas or other similar groups, or even ISIS or Al Queda, attacking them.

So what about before 1987? You're just cooking up any excuse now.

&gt;You wonder why israelis ""aren't obsessing over how terrible, hateful, and cruel they are"". 

Never said that. All I said is that there is a complete absence of any talk about Israel's violence or even the occupation in the /r/Israel sub. 

Anyway, I'm not going to bother referring to the rest of your initial post outlining the ""Israeli narrative"", as busy at the moment sorry. ",cumn621,False

A lot of people appreciate a unique, local culturally influenced voice rather than a voice that is altered to appeal to the lowest common global denominator. And to me that's a good thing. I hope Polish devs continue to make games that reflect Polish culture, demographics, values, circumstances, etc. And likewise for devs in the Ukraine, South Africa, etc. If a game made in Zimbabwe is 100% black I'm fine with that.

Edit: Let me clarify a bit. Game made in Poland has a legit reason to be all-white, and a game made in Liberia has a legit reason to be all-black. Fiction is still reflective of the culture of the creators, being fiction or fantasy doesn't change that. 

That logic does not work for games made in the US or Canada or England. An large-scale all-white game from the US would not be reflective of US culture.",cumnmlp,1441078516

Moderates = most likely a Taqiyya driven individual who may not commit acts of terror themselves, but will surely defend Islam and deny the problem within.

Some European countries are failing economically. Others are doing incredibly well. I know that the United Kingdom has a much higher economic growth rate than the US, and they have many democratic socialist reforms in place. Sweden and Norway are even more extreme than Bernie, and yet they are faring fine.    

The most important thing to remember is that compared to all of the industrialized countries in Europe, the US has the lowest standard of living. Highest rates of mental illness, highest rates of infant mortality, teen pregnancy, hunger, poverty. Highest expenditures on healthcare and education, but we have the shortest life expectancy and we do very poorly on standardized tests. The only thing we are #1 in? Economic inequality, which happens to correlate to all of the factors I mentioned above. We don't have to have a progressive social democracy like Sweden, but there are steps we can take in that direction that would improve our quality of life while keeping the budget balanced.

&gt;Then explain France. And Portugal. And Greece. And Iceland. And Sweden. And Spain. And Italy. But yeah, the ideas totally work! /s

Firstly, Greece and Italy are hardly social democracies. Even Portugal and Spain are barely in that category. I was talking about Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the UK, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium. And most of these countries are doing just fine (you named Sweden but their economy isn't in shambles at all).  

But back to my original point. For almost 50 years, our country had 1) strict regulations on financial institutions 2) living wages for workers 3) high taxes on the super-wealthy 4) little corporate welfare. This worked brilliantly for our economy and for The People. We know these measures work! And they are hardly unpopular ideas.

Daily, at least 6-7 hours a day. At least 60 hours a week.

&gt;How often do you visit /r/europe ?

All the time, it's my most active sub.

&gt;What country are you normally resident in?

Romania.

&gt;Do you speak any languages besides English? (If yes: which and to what level?)

Romanian as a native speaker and French as beginner.

&gt;What interests you about Europe?

It's history, culture and food.

&gt;What are your favourite and least favourite things about /r/europe[3] ?

My least favorite thing about /r/europe is the attitude of the current moderator team that confuses their opinions on matters with the rules of the sub and as such moderating in a biased and flawed manner.

My favorite thing about this sub, is that even after being a default it actually manages to represent the very many opinions of people in real life.

&gt;Do you have experience as a moderator or similar?

I've not been a moderator on reddit before, but I have been a moderator on others forums a long time ago.

&gt;Why do you want to be a moderator?

Because not only do I think the current moderator team is undermanned, but I also think the current moderator team isn't that good, or at least the moderators that are the most active. The current moderator team has not been able to show it can actually moderate in a fair and unbiased fashion, something that the people in the sub have noticed to a great degree and is actually the root cause of many of the problems.

Currently the users simply don't trust the moderator team and any and all moderating decisions are scrutinized with a very skeptical view, simply because of the lack of trust.

&gt;why do you think you would be a good moderator?

I think I would make a very good moderator, because I can separate my personal opinions from my moderating.

&gt;do you have any expirence with statistics, datamining or reddit bots?

Some experince with statistics, but no to the rest.

&gt;What is your opinion on the immigration megathread? What do you think went wrong (if anything)?

The immigration megathread was a complete clusterfuck from beginning to end. I don't know what exactly possessed the mods of this sub to start it because it was an obvious disaster from the get go.

I don't know if it was actually meant to be a good faith try at keeping the immigration threads in one place or if it was an attempt at banning the topic without actually saying so. I certainly hope it's the former, but somewhat expect it's the latter, regardless the people on this sub saw right through it for what it was, pure censorship.

&gt;What's one weakness you have?

I'm a very direct person, sometimes a bit too direct and I end up saying things a bit too bluntly.

&gt;Would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses?

A hundred duck sized horses.

Most of the stainless alloys used in jewelry/timepieces today don't contain any nickel or at least not enough to cause irritation to sensitive individuals. I think this is primarily thanks to Europe, where they enacted some laws: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_Directive

Basically, any watch being sold by a major company in Europe will likely have the same low-nickel or nickel-free stainless alloys in the US as well. They aren't likely to make two separate production lines just so they can use nickel in a US model watch. 

I don't currently own a Timex, although I had a stainless-backed Timex when I was growing up and never had any issues with it. Currently I wear a stainless Seiko 5 on a daily basis, no problems with that either.

What usually gets me are things like the backs of the fly buttons on certain brands of jeans and the backs of pearl snaps on western style shirts. I remember having a terrible bout of contact dermatitis when I was a kid from a military dog-tag style ball chain.

A few hours everyday.

&gt;How often do you visit /r/europe?

A couple of hours everyday.

&gt;What country are you normally resident in?

India.

&gt;Do you speak any languages besides English? (If yes: which and to what level?)

English and Marathi with native fluency, Hindi at an advanced fluency, German at maybe a B1 level, some basic A1 French and Swedish. I can read and write Cyrillic, if that counts.

&gt;What interests you about Europe?

European culture and history, mainly. Also EU politics and stuff.

&gt; What are your favourite and least favourite things about /r/europe?

Favourite things - pretty diverse, redditors from more or less all over Europe (even France!).

Least favourite things - same stuff happening on literally every other thread lately. Migrant news, ""Europe should do XYZ"" - there's fuckall new discussion happening, and it gets stale after a bit.

&gt; Do you have experience as a moderator or similar?

I moderate /r/india, a similar sub (geographically bound, politics based) with similar problems. So, yes.

&gt; Why do you want to be a moderator?

Cause it's actually quite a bit of fun.

&gt; why do you think you would be a good moderator?

I feel like I'm more familiar with how to exploit reddit's (shitty) mod features like automod, user notes - you would not have had the whole ban fiasco if you had just tagged users with notes the whole time. Of course, I'm just assuming that you don't exploit all these features, not being on the inside, I can't say. Being a mod, I would definitely help in streamlining this process, and make the whole process of moderating a lot smoother.

Also, I believe that (9 out of 10 times) when any post is removed, the user should be informed as to why his post was removed. Over PM. I'm not sure if you lads do that. Same goes for when someone is banned. Also, banning should not be used on the first offence, except in rare cases - three strikes rule is the best. Use user notes to keep track.

Deleting comments needs to happen a bit more; I think the problem is with a lack of reporting, a lack of mod activity (most shitty comments stay up for hours before getting deleted), and a lack of decent automod filters to bring them into the modqueue in the first place. 

Also, one of my biggest aims is to implement a comprehensive flair system, similar to the one we have on /r/india, with separate rules for each flair, each necessitating a varying level of comment quality. 

&gt; do you have any expirence with statistics, datamining or reddit bots?

Yes, I've studied data mining and predictive statistics, and I'm familiar with PRAW, though I've never written a bot. I'm not super familiar with descriptive statistics but I understand how they work.

&gt;What is your opinion on the immigration megathread? What do you think went wrong (if anything)?

Mixed feelings, leaning towards negative. It was impossible to manage with the constant flurry of news, mods didn't seem to care much about regularly updating it, and people's dissatisfaction with it creeped into pretty much every other discussion. On the other hand, at least it ensured some diversity on the front page.

Censorship of criticism of the megathread was absolutely not okay, IMO, and that whole part was an utter clusterfuck.

&gt;What's one weakness you have?

I use Reddit on mobile when I'm taking a dump. Can't do much moderation then, I can only writhe in helplessness.

&gt; Would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses?

Duck sized horses.

&gt; What single word connects all of these three of the following words: Europe, Pussy Cat, Teacher? Explain why

/u/SlyRatchet - he lives in Europe, has a Pussy Cat and tries to Teach people about social democracy.

The problem with your entire proposal is that it ignores the economic realities that face Canada, and have **always** faced Canada: we can't compete. Literally. We can't compete. Whether it is with low taxes and low wages in China or the South, or the capital and marketing budgets of large US corporations. Canada's economy is dwarfed by the US and China. One might point to Vestas, the largest manufactuer of wind turbines, as an example to emulate. They are, after all, based in little old Denmark!

The problem is that their place in the EU means they are, economically speaking, more like a state in the US in this regard, and most of the customers of Vestas (and Siemens, who also bases their wind operations out of the country) service the entire EU in a preferential way. Oh, and they also base most of their manufacturing out of China. Surprise surprise.

Despite dreams of Macdonald from the days of Confederation, our country is **small** in population, which also means we are small in capital and expertise. The best and the brightest in these fields are already working, and the market itself is already very well saturated with manufacturing for both solar and wind turbines well under capacity.

It is inclusive of that (heavy) influence, but it can also be taken as a representation of closely related cultures; think of Anglo-Saxon England and some pieces fall into place as well. 

This is partly to do with The Witcher's anachronisms as well. It doesn't present a time coherent representation of medieval European cultures, but has culture types separated by time interacting with one-another. Skellige is predominantly a depiction of early/high medieval Scandinavia, but also stands in for other early/high medieval cultures. Nilfgaard is kind of like Germany's Holy Roman Empire, but a great deal of its cultural influence comes directly from ancient Rome. The continental Northern Kingdoms are like late medieval central Europe, being predominantly related to Slavic and Germanic cultures from the time (especially where these cultural influences are likely to cross over -- see Poland itself, naturally, but also the likes of Austria). 

Sorry, I went off the rails a little there. I think the English voice work in this game does a really good job of conveying a series of medieval societies that doesn't actually include a direct equivalent of late medieval England. It doesn't convey those societies in the most absolute literal sense, but it does nod towards the combination of real world cultures that have gone into the various peoples of this setting.

2) There are many parts of the world—Europe, northern South America, southeast Africa—where a relatively common border crossing involves switching the side of the road you drive on, resulting in a mixture of left-hand-drive and right-hand-drive vehicles on roads (and thus using heir gas stations), meaning you'd *never* actually experience the benefit of a consistent rule for fueling as you're proposing this would accomplish.

3) It actually is significantly easier to change which side of the car the steering wheel goes on than it is to change the placement of the gas tank. Keep in mind: The steering wheel and dashboard go in the cabin of the car. The big, empty space where people and stuff are supposed to go. Sure, there's some new tooling involved for the dashboard, but for the most part, it doesn't matter where in the cabin the steering wheel goes, and the steering linkage is pretty flexible about positioning. On the other hand... the gas tank is part of the car's guts, where they're packing stuff in as tightly as possible. It's mounted onto body work, which at this point is frequently structural monocoque, which means damaging the integrity of the body is damaging the integrity of the car's frame in a crash. Also, the engine compartment isn't symmetrical, so moving the gas tank means rerouting all sorts of cabling inside the car... and the new routes may pose major dangers in an accident.

She goes on to say it's not impossible, but that it does pose an obstacle and a 'legal quagmire'.

One year on, and both Andy Burnham and Jeremy Corbyn have promised to renationalise Britain’s railway network.  The debate has certainly shifted left, but could either Andy or Jeremy deliver on such a promise? I’m not so sure, as neither candidate have said how they would address the big obstacle that their promise faces: the European Union.

&gt;Undoubtedly EU law will be a huge obstacle to any renationalisation scheme – especially one that aims to do away with competition and markets. The EU is clear that its objective is “Opening up national freight and passenger markets to cross-border competition”. Its directives and regulations have created what can only be described as a legal quagmire.

&gt;The main EU law in this area was the First Railway Directive (which was replaced and upgraded in 2012 with a new version). This was the original law that gave the Tories the excuse they needed to introduce their privatisation agenda in the nineties. That law enshrined the role of the private sector by making it a legal requirement for independent companies to be able to apply for non-discriminatory track access on a member state’s track, calling for:

       “separating [of] the management of railway 
        operation and infrastructure from the provision

Ik ben van mening dat we echte vluchtelingen moeten helpen. Ik ken enkele mensen die Nederland als vluchteling zijn binnen gekomen omdat ze in eigen land niet welkom waren (meestal vanwege geloof of geaardheid) en die zijn heel goed terecht gekomen en hele harde werkers. Maar ik vind niet dat we economische ""vluchtelingen"" moeten helpen. Het gaat om vele duizende van die gasten die enkel hier lijken te komen voor geld en de sociale voorzieningen.

Pas lorsque que chaque joueur a un jeu. Cela a des effets tels que la baisse des revenus médians des entreprises/créateurs en l'occurrence. C'est ce qu'un graphique partagé par steamspy montrait la semaine dernière. Le revenu médian par jeu a drastiquement chuté, et d'après les quelques exemples partagés par netsabes, cela ne semble pas être seulement dû à la marée de jeux qui viennent saturer steam. 

Cela ne veut pas dire non plus que le marché ne croit pas. Cela veut juste dire qu'il y a un nombre croissant de développeurs qui se cassent les dents ou qui gagnent moins bien leur vie sur leurs jeux. La plupart des devs de jeux que j'ai eu l'occasion de rencontrer depuis plus d'un an gardent une activité à côté du développement de leurs jeux pour tourner. Sur mobiles, je n'ai pas un seul contact qui gagne sa vie en auto-publication. Côté jeux pour browser mobile (un petit marché), on a pu voir la scène se saturer en moins d'un an, et les ventes de licences ont baissé pour tout le monde. 

Jonathan Blow parlait de cela aussi ces derniers jours: ""Si vous voulez quitter votre job sur un jeu AAA, vous avez raté le bus de 4 ou 5 ans."" Cela ne veut pas dire qu'on ne peut pas vivre de la création indépendante de jeux - juste que l'environnement est moins favorable aujourd'hui qu'il y a quelques années.

Pour finir, le marché automobile n'est pas un bon exemple. C'est un marché dominé par une poignée de grands groupes. Rien qu'en France, on a  incité les gens à jeter leur voiture (prime à la casse) pour en changer, on joue sur l’obsolescence programmée ou les services pour gonfler le marché. Avec le tout électronique, on ne peut plus réparer soi-même une voiture récente, ce qui oblige à l'amener dans un garage constructeur pour le moindre pépin. 

Le prix de vente des jeux à quant à lui bien chuté au fil des années (ou le ratio entre le prix de vente/budget pour les productions AAA). J'avais bien aimé cet article de puppy game au sujet de la valeur des ventes: http://www.puppygames.net/blog/?p=1574",cumtfvb,False

#####*Head to Head*

* PiTER vs E-Frag on Cache went 10-16 (May 20^th , 2015)
* PiTER vs E-Frag on Mirage went 16-5 (March 20^th , 2015) 

Note: PiTER's lineup has changed to now include spaze instead of wayLander. Also only 2 matches have been played between these teams in a time frame that is reasonable.

**PiTER**

* GREATONE-LINERS vs PiTER on Cobble went 14-16 (August 30^th , 2015)

* AliGon vs PiTER on Cache went 16-21 (August 30^th , 2015)

* Dobry&amp;Gaming (ex-G2) vs PiTER on Cobble went 8-16, on Mirage went 16-5 and Cache 16-4 (August 13^th , 2015)

**E-Frag**

* Fraternitas vs E-Frag on Cache went 16-9, on Mirage went 9-16 and Dust 2 went 12-16 (August 30^th , 2015)

**PiTER**

PiTER is a Russian Team that is Tier 3 Globally. They have played in a wide range of tournaments against opponents of varying skill. They are a mixed bag when it comes to results. They sometimes put up amazing fights against some teams they should have just gone down to, however on the other hand they haven't shown this type of gameplay since wayLander left. Which leads me into another point, wayLander was the carry of the team and the loss of him whilst not 100% crippling, did leave a big dent. In there recent results you can see that against no name teams they are struggling. I still believe there is always some of that PiTER magic available ever since Titan (old Titan with KennyS and APex) vs PiTER on Cache for the ESL Qualifiers in 2014 (if anyone remembers that).

---
---

**E-Frag**

E-Frag is a Bulgarian team that is Tier 2 Globally. These guys have earned a name for themselves upsetting teams like NV (old NV, Smithz and Shox) and TSM. They have most recently achieved really good results at APM coming in 3^rd . With these upsets comes a lot of hype from the community and I am not sure if they have fully warranted it yet as there have been extenuating circumstances around their wins. This is not to take anything from them as a win against the caliber of teams they have won against is still an amazing feat even on those teams off days. The have since then routinely stomped all teams in the games where they were clear overdogs in and I expect this trend to continue on to this match. There are no more obvious negatives I can think of for them heading into this match.

---
---

**Conclusion:**

**TL;DR** E-Frag should take this game dominantly.

My Odds: 90:10

My Bet: Skip (due to inventory not being large enough to take advantage of odds)

Recommended Bet: High (20%) to Very High (30%) on E-Frag if it corresponds to $300 or more for you and if odds stay above 90:10. ICB (1%) if they drop below that.

1) union *job*: No. Private sector. Well paid, highly talented. Hard to get sector. I'm headhunted on a monthly basis. 

2) Greece. Greece is complex and to say ""socialism broke greece"" is reallllly simplistic.

To understand Greece, you need to understand two things:

1. The failing of Greek institutions (which could be considered failings of socialism, but I would call failings of a patronage based political class - i.e. an economy ruled by an oligarchy)

2. The impact of the euro upon greece and upon germany. 

See, Germany benefits from having Greece in the Euro in the same way that California benefits from having Mississippi in the US.

If California had the Californian Peso and Mississippi had their own currency, then exports from California would be significantly more expensive than they are under the USD. Since California and Mississippi share a currency union, and since the economic output per capita of California is significantly greater than the per capita output of Mississippi, that means that Mississippi artificially makes exports from California cheaper than they *should* be.

In the US, this imbalance is somewhat addressed by direct fiscal transfer. Taxes from Californians are redirected to the poorer state of Mississippi.

This is NOT unfair because if California did not share a currency union with Mississippi, then California would not export as much. Therefore, California - in a sense - owes it to Mississippi to transfer some of their taxes to Mississippi (via the mechanism of federal taxation).

Now, let's return to Europe.

In the same way that Mississippi's poor GDP drags down the value of the USD, the poor GDP of Greece drags down the Euro.

Unlike the USA, there is no significant fiscal transfer between the EU states. So Germany benefits from a euro that is significantly lower than what the duestchmark would be and has better exports than it would have if the euro was not being dragged down by Greece.

So a BIG PART of the problem in EU is a LACK of socialism (fiscal transfer from the wealthy to the poor). This fiscal transfer does exist in the USA and is part of why the USA manages to maintain a fiscal union between economically disparate states.

Now yes. There are problems with Greece itself. It was very poorly governed, and the welfare state there is bloated by overly generous pensions. But the biggest problem that Greece faces is that it really shouldn't have been part of the Euro. 

The value of the Euro, relative to the drachma, is dragged up by Germany. This makes Greek exports more expensive than they would have been under the drachma.

So although Greek socialism does have significant faults, the major structural flaws in the Greek economy were caused by a lack of socialism at the European / ""federal"" level in contrast to the socialist economic transfer that occurs at the federal level between US states. ",cumtnw1,False

Here is same shit in 2013 - http://versii.if.ua/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/9.jpg

Also another popular excuse is that it's all was goverment provocateurs. But then month later, when much large amount of people were attacking police and throwing Molotovs, no one was denying that it is Maidan, and not just some provocateurs.

Personally, I didn't supported Yanukovich, and i don't like Russia and Russian politics, and I want Ukraine being European country, yet I never supported Maidan specifically because it was full of right wingers, ultra-nationalists, because it wasn't peaceful, because it was lead by politicians who are liars, who use hate in their speeches to motivate people, because there was no critical thinking, but instead double standards and dishonesty, and aggression.

But for people who supported Maidan - I'm the stupid one, vatnik, victim of propaganda, putin-bot.

And now some are still arguing, that it's not like year ago! It's different. Those was peaceful Molotovs against evil police.

And this one they want to blame not on their ideology and double standards, and lack of notion about real peaceful protest, but just on one political party (well, I would happy anyway, if they will put to prison, at least this one, for what they did, but still), and claim that they are sell-outs, paid by Kremlin. 

It's same denial again. 

And those nationalists, some times ago they were considered as patriots, disregard of their hateful speeches, against democratic values, in support of war and violence. But today, they are traitors, because instead of throwing weak explosives and smoke bombs, they decided to throw real frag grenade. It's like beating police with sticks and throw rocks is not enough indication of their intent to harm someone.

And irony is that some Maidan journalists, now use photo of Svoboda party members attacking with sticks police, 
against them. But when there was same photos in 2013 (attacking evil Yanukovich police), they ignored them, and was arguing that it was provocateurs.

As for which ones I'd do first, that's kind of hard to say. I try to keep a prioritized list in my mind, but it's literally always changing. Right now I'm working on Turkish, so I guess I'll list that first. So:

* Turkish (maybe cross over to Azeri)
* Russian (maybe add Tatar here)
* Urdu (maybe Hindi/Sanskrit if I focus on South Asia)
* Uzbek
* Polish
* Arabic
* Punjabi
* German
* Hungarian
* Mandarin
* Japanese
* Korean
* Swedish
* Italian
* Romanian
* (Spanish too I guess, although I studied it before so usually don't include it on wish lists)

Also I already know Farsi, so other Iranian languages are a possibility like Pashto, Kurdish, Pamiri, Yaghnobi, Gilaki, and the like. Surprisingly though, I don't have such a strong desire for them even though I think they're really cool. Slavic languages other than Russian and Polish aren't so important to me, but I wish I knew them anyway. If I knew a couple of Slavic languages very well I think I could easily adapt to the others.

After that I'd probably get into weirder stuff like Baltic and Balkan languages, and miscellaneous European:

* Greek
* Armenian
* Bulgarian
* Albanian
* Bosnian
* Latvian
* Estonian
* Lithuanian
* Finnish
* Georgian

I didn't ask for a source. And, as I expected, your source doesn't tell us why someone was rejected, so it doesn't even refute what I wrote. Good job.

&gt; It's also funny when people pretend to know asylum laws and all the international treaties. Every country can decide its rules and can accept way more people than they have to or they can choose the strict application of the treaties. Also every case is judgded indivualy, so there is big space for interpretation. Sweden and Germany are very benevolent, other countries are not. 

Sweden and Germany are simply not dodging their obligations. If a Syrian were to apply for asylum in any Eastern European country, it will be basically impossible to deny that request.

&gt; And refugees don't have only rights, but also obligations. And one of the main obligation of a refugee is to ask asylum in the first safe country. When they come to Czechia or germany, they already went through like dozen of safe countries, they are illegal immigrants.

No, that's not an obligation for the refugee. A refugee is a person that is displaced from their country, full stop:

 &gt;   (...) the term ""refugee"" shall apply to any person who (...) owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.

From the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The ""they have to stay in the first safe country"" is just made up. Of course it is, it would put way too much of a burden on the neighbouring countries of any crisis. So, what you are doing amounts to claiming that Jews who fled Germany in 1933 and tried to go to America rather than France are illegal immigrants. It's ridiculous.

However, European countries have agreed to a safe country rule in that they expect the first EU country to handle all refugees. That's what's known as the Dublin regulation. It wasn't a problem when the refugee numbers were small, but now the countries at the external border are overwhelmed. All they expect is some solidarity in upholding the laws we have *all* agreed to.",cumuriq,False

I'll admit though that when I am involved in a conversation about women in games I am usually optimistic that we are headed towards a better situation, and I do avoid to actually talk about what has been going on for the past year.

Not with the intent to hide it, but it doesn't have any legitimate substance. I think at the end of the day being pro, anti, against gameragate or even involving yourself with any of the sides is just not going to improve the industry at all, I don't think the industry improved in an ethical sense in the past year even though people point out some problems such as Anita's videos, and the issues in journalism posted here and there, but I don't think anyone's really doing something positive.

It feels that it's all up in the air, and it feels that whether or not it's working out towards something good it's not the primary concern for many people who are rather more interested in winning arguments.

Sometimes I see some articles about people concerned that their kids play video games, and often it's easily seen as a pastime for boys and when a girl tries to pick up a game it seems some parents hesitate to actually let them put some time in video games.

There are parents who despite all the work PEGI has put in Europe and the ESRB has put in the US and to an extent Canada have no idea what kind of game GTA is. I've been faced multiple times with the awkward situation that I've to explain that their 14 year old son is essentially playing a game designed for adults.

And when I see this I think that in real life most people don't know what video games actually are outside of the general definition, what some video games are about, and that they even target adults. Many don't even know that many video games contain rich stories, great characters and unique experiences for the player.",cumvbhy,1441114433

The ground school and exams are also very tough. There are also only a limited number of schools that offer it and they usually suggest that you take a lot of time out from your career to live nearby and do it intensively, something that's not practical for a thirtysomething family man.

The Restricted IR is 15 hours, can be taught almost anywhere, covers broadly the same topics (crucially missing out holds and holding!) and training, but you can't use it in Class A airspace or outside of the UK (and the minima are more restrictive). You're taught to fly, navigate and approach/land in IMC so you're fully capable (in theory, currency and aptitude permitting) of flying IFR and getting from A to B with a much lower cost/training overhead.

Also as /u/blueb0g mentioned, you're then able to build up some instrument flying hours to make the full Instrument Rating a little less unobtainable.

It's worth noting that a basic European PPL has *no* night training or night flying privileges, perhaps one hour of VOR tracking and *maybe* 30 minutes of instrument flying as part of the training syllabus.

Born in Tehran before the revolution and left the country with her mother at the end of the Iraq-Iran war to Israel. She still speaks Farsi with her mother, however she is now 100% Israeli.

The thing with Iran is that the Islamic revolution changed everything. Before the revolution Jews and urban classes in major cities lived largely secular life. However after the revolution as religion became the key thing defining everything, Jews and Christians also became more religious, not necessarily they believed more, but they followed rules more to appear more acceptable in the eyes of government officials.

However I believe that if Iran would today become a parliamentary democracy with separation of state and religion, it wouldn't take much time before people would ease up on following religious beliefs and the society would become more secular. The thing in the whole middle-east is that faith and religion is forced down to masses, people don't have individual freedom to choose not to abide or not by religious rules. Thus everything is defined by religion.

I myself see these things as I am Finnish and  since Finland became independent at the beginning of 20th century, we have given religious freedom for everybody from Christians to Jews and Tatar Muslims not to mention we have made sure to give people freedom from religion. Because of this there is much stronger cohesion, for example Jews in Finnish army fought side by side with German Wehrmacht against the Soviets even thought they knew what Nazis were doing in rest of Europe. This alleviates the power of freedom, if there wouldn't have been so much freedom in the society, then our country would have been much weaker and thus could not have been fight successfully against the Soviets. The great tragedy of the middle-eastern countries is that by curtailing freedom of individuals, they have made their countries much weaker.

You say now, after trying (and failing) to compare large aggregates and multiple variables between the US and EU and/or the US and the UK. I was just using it as an example to illustrate how ridiculous and misleading only looking at gun homicides and not homicides as a whole is when evaluating gun control's effectiveness.

&gt;I feel that police have no need to own guns , except for speciallized squads which are called when needed.

This works in the UK because few people have guns, while in the US a gun being present is a reasonable expectation at any scene. There are more guns than people in this country (~400 million). That's not exaggeration, it's an actual statistic. If the specialized squad gets deployed for every situation in which there could be a gun, it could be up to 50% of calls. At that point it's hardly a small specialized squad anymore is it? If you could dream up a feasible way to remove them all from the populace *and* stop replacements from coming in, your welcome to share it. Then the US could steadily reduce the amount of armed officers.

&gt;you should be able to get a permit for them,but there's no reason for general population to be able to purchase and use guns as they see fit.

Plenty of states do put restrictions on buying guns and who can own them. But as I've just shown you, the amount of gun control in a state has seemingly no effect on homicide rate. Criminals get guns whether they're legal or not. They commit murder regardless against people who have one more option for self-defense taken away. The reason for purchasing a gun is pretty self-explanatory, for hunting/target-shooting/self-defense. Folding pocket knives also have a fairly self-explanatory purpose but are commonly used in murders. Would you also also institute permits for them? What about the really large ones? What about machetes/swords? Axes?

There are still many other industrial chemicals than cyanide that can readily be used to poison yourself or others. You can do it with plenty of cleaning agents. Cyanide and barbiturates are targeted because they are among the most painless (and thus, sought after) methods of suicide. This is the type of gun control that I favor, focused on suicides and mass shooting. There's some (still inexact) correlation between gun control and [suicide rates](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/spr08gunprevalence/). A better mental health system and a means to background check it are good measures, along with mandatory secured storage requirements.

A term used for any alcoholic beverage made from water, malted barley, hops and yeast.  The types of yeast, grains and hops used determine the particular style of beer.

**Ale**
A beer that is fermented with top fermenting yeast at a temperature of 60-72 F.  This class of beer ferments faster than lagers typically do.  The higher temperatures result in different type of esters (flavors from yeast) released from yeast which tend to be on the brighter and fruitier side.  Ales is one of two major classes of beer (the other being lagers).  There are many styles of beer that are ales such as Stouts, IPA's, Pale Ales, Porters, Cream ale and lambics to name a few (even these styles have substyles). 

**Lager** A beer that is fermented with bottom fermenting yeast at a temperature below 60 F (the exact temperature/temperature schedule depends on the style of Lager).  This class of beer ferments at a lower temperature and ferments a bit slower than ales typically do.  The cold temperature usually results in a crisper/cleaner flavor that usually isnt muddled by the sweetness of the grains as well as a clearer appearance since the yeast falls out of suspension after fermentation (this is called flocculation).  There are many style of Lager each with their own sub styles.  Some styles are Pilsner, American Lager, German Lagers and European Lagers.

**Stout** A stout is a style of Ale that features grains that are roasted more heavily which give it a dark and sometimes ruby appearance.  The roasted grains also contribute heavily to the roasted, chocolate and coffee flavors that are prevalent.  The body of the beer is usually medium-low to high (this refers to the mouth feel and is dependent on the residual sugars left over after fermentation as some sugars cant be fermented by yeast).  There are different substyles of stouts such as Milk Stouts, Dry Stout AKA Irish Stout, and Oatmeal Stouts to name a few.

Pero tengo la impresión de que, a pesar de numerosas opiniones en ete foro y por lo que dicen nuestros dirigentes, no nos hacemos una idea precisa de cuánto nos afecta a nosotros la deriva claudicante de Tsipras y Syriza.

Recojo estos párrafos del artículo, que a mí me parecen particularmente esclarecedores acerca de dónde nos encontramos, de qué manera, y qué podríamos hacer: empezando por nosotros para inmediatamente intentar sacar al pueblo griego del abismo:

""...

*Es aquí y en este momento donde surge la pregunta sobre qué podemos hacer por Grecia, ya que en ello se juega nuestro futuro. Ante el cambio radical de rumbo evidenciado por Syriza ¿qué podría hacer el movimiento popular que apoyó y confió en ese partido y que lo nombró aliado en la ruta emancipatoria?; ¿qué se puede hacer para paliar los efectos de tamaña derrota sobre el proyecto popular naciente en España?; ¿cómo podemos colaborar verdaderamente con el pueblo griego, cómo podemos apoyarles? Quizá diciendo que esto no es sino una derrota más en la larga lucha de los pueblos por una vida mejor, una derrota de sus líderes y de su partido, quienes equivocaron la estrategia y finalmente vendieron humo hundiendo las ilusiones de su pueblo. Se trata a lo mejor de distanciarse de aquellos que vuelven a llevar a su país a la senda de la sumisión y de apoyar sin ambages a los que en Grecia siguen optando por una alternativa a la soga de la Troika y apuestan con fundamento (ver notas al final) a que esta es posible. Desarrollar la verdad de lo que está ocurriendo en Grecia, sin disfrazarla bajo el manto de que se respetan las reglas de la democracia y rechazar la deriva neoliberal del Gobierno griego actual, podría mantener la ilusión en un proyecto -nutrido de otras luchas emancipadoras- que se oponga a la repetición mortífera de las medidas de austeridad*.

*Podemos hacer esto por Grecia, lo cual es hacerlo también por el conjunto de España*.
...""*

Como partido no podemos ni debemos pegarnos a Tsipras por la mera excusa de haber convocado a elecciones anticipadas (""Le llaman democracia pero no lo es"", ¿recuerdas?). Para las aspiraciones emancipatorias de España y de otras partes de Europa, es un lastre: no hay nada peor para nostros y nuestra lucha, que un gobierno que llegó con una política definida y refrendada mayoritariamente, se rinda al enemigo y aplique la voluntad del vencedor.


Los dirigentes y los partidos deben estar al servicio del pueblo. Si no lo están, entonces no nos sirven y deben ser barridos.

El Syriza ""oficial"" que invocando ""el mal menor"" continuará aplicando las políticas de la troika hasta 2050 interviniendo hasta la subsecretería más irrelevante, no puede ser nuestro aliado. Tsipras, que ejerciendo el poder no sería distinto de ""nuestro"" Pedro Sánchez, ya no puede ser considerado un ""referente progresista europeo"".


Como dice Galbraith, efectivamente Grecia está siendo saqueada (cosa que hasta un miope como pantuflo reconocería). Lo que no dice Galbraith que quien está ""saqueando al pueblo a favor de la corona"", es nadie menos que el presidente que fue elegido y refrendado por los griegos para que hiciera lo contrario (esto también seguramente lo dice o dirá pantuflo... pero por sus abyectas razones, que no las nuestras).


Si fuéramos egoístas, y por lo que nos va el tema, tal vez diríamos *""Este capullo nos ha jodido la movida que veníamos preparando con tanto cuidado"".*",cumwwmh,1441108256

NV GPUs: Has 1 road, with 1 lane for Cars (Graphics) and 32 lanes for Trucks (Compute).  
But it cannot have both Cars and Trucks on the road at the same time. If the road is being used by Cars, Trucks have to wait in queue until all the Cars are cleared, then they can enter. This is the context switch that programmers refer to. It has a performance penalty.  
AMD GCN GPUs: Has 1 Road (CP; Command Processor) with 1 lane for Cars &amp; Trucks. Has an EXTRA 8 Roads (ACEs; Asynchronous Compute Engines) with 8 lanes each (64 total) for Trucks only.
So Cars and Truck can move freely, at the same time towards their destination, in parallel, asynchronously, Trucks through the ACEs, Cars through the CP. There is no context switch required.  
NV's design is good for DX11, because DX11 can ONLY use 1 Road, period. GCN's ACEs are doing nothing in DX11, the extra roads are inaccessible/closed. DX12 opens all the roads.  
  
edit : That was from the thread, and yes i had amd cards before the 970, that i bought a in dec 2014 when we taught had real 4G Vram... then we learn it's only 3.5GB, now i learn that a card half the price of mine will do better in dx 12 (coming next year in a lot of games).

If Corbyn wins, the referendum will get very interesting indeed: I'm convinced that it's only the coaxing of traditional Labour voters into supporting the EU post Clause 4 under Blair and Brown that is preventing a big block of voters choosing to leave. Jeremy has himself said that he would not support an EU that has corporate interests at its heart, which it always has done and always will, so if he is leading the party heading into a vote and backed as it sounds like he will be by a number of unions, there could be a big boost to the ""out"" campaign.

It will read something like this:

**In**: ""Wet"" Conservatives , Blairite Labour , Lib Dems, Green, SNP, Plaid Cymru, Some Unions

**Out**: Eurosceptic Conservatives, Traditional Labour now , UKIP, DUP, TUSC and other socialist parties, Most Unions

The political balance is still seemingly in favour of the ""in"" campaign, but any support for ""out"" from Labour, which it seems has probably been bubbling under the surface of the Blairite facade for a number of years, makes the playing field more even. It's all to play for.",cumxsqv,1441111071

Loved the game, especially the differences between the two sides - the Allies were fast but weak. The Soviets were slow, but tough as nails. Tank rushing was the primary tactic of both sides - especially the Soviets. Get a Mammoth wall constructed and it could roll over everything. But beyond that, I liked the tone of the game, along with Tiberium Dawn and Tiberium Sun. In Dawn, the world was rife with war which was being percipitated due to the presence of this new, dangerous and lucrative alien plant. The Nod took the opportunity to stir up the pot as they could fund a war machine with the easy access to valuable minerals. In Sun, the danger of Tiberium was ramped up - no longer a useful little plant, it was fast becoming a global pandemic. Red Alert had the same tone - there was no alien plant, but the what if factor of killing Hitler allowed the Red Army to gain steam and begin rolling over Europe.

But ... that tone started to shift. Red Alert 2, while excellent, began the descent into cheeky territory, with Yuri and his mind control. It was still dark in tone and if you accepted the existence of mind control, the theater of war was entertaining. Red Alert 3 took the game into campy directions. The story, the units, the tech ... it was a bit too silly. And the game mechanics were modified such that battle didn't feel as entertaining as it did before. Same with Tiberium Twilight. The games units and powers and story started bordering on the ridiculous over time. C&amp;C 4 was garbage and I refuse to call it a proper C&amp;C game.

Overall, I liked the series, both of them. I would love to see it revisited with the same dark tone as the originals. Maybe a new what if or a more thought out retelling of the alien plant invasion.",cumxtj1,False

I generally agree with your post and there needs to be such discussions. People should also note that anytime there are cuts in anything, chances are that people are losing their jobs. This strikes a nerve but somehow when people talk about cutting military, it's all these poor people losing their jobs (and I don't disagree) but whenever people are talking about waste in welfare or cutting Social Security, people tend to not care about how this affects peoples lives. Oh we don't have the money for these programs... but there's an issue in Libya, let's magically find tens of billions in military equipment and use it within a month. Have you noticed that we always seem to have no problems finding money for the military but rarely find any money to help people?

The problem with education in the US is very simple: education is frowned upon. This is partly because teachers were highly valued in the Cold War. We had a sense of pride about our country and we wanted to be the best. Then these people were called ""square"" and an increasing counterculture of stupid people focusing on entertainment rather than education sprung up. Look at the top earners today and you'll find quite a bit of extremely stupid people who are wealthy only because of their entertainment value.

I'm not saying we should spend more money on teachers salaries - like the military, spending more money doesn't make it better. I think we as a country need to change in how we view education. Look at China. Sure, they're going overboard with these ""tiger moms"" which is more or less abuse but education is highly valued there. Look at India. Same thing - education is highly valued. Europe? Education is highly valued. In this country? Education is not highly valued. In addition, these are groups of people who are trying to dumb down education for religious or political reasons. The fact that this even happens makes us the butt of global jokes.

I actually grew up in USSR and education was extremely valued there. School was 9-4, Monday through Saturday, September through mid-June. Teachers were seen as people who are making the country great by educating the next generation. When I came to the US, I saw much looser standards. People who were failing still went to the next grade rather than being held back. People are graded on a ""curve"" and various other lax policies. In college towards the end, professors whose job was teaching were replaced with researchers. The assumption is that researchers know more about the field. Problem is - researchers fail in two areas:

* they're not teachers and they might make awful teachers (and some of mine were terrible)
* their attitude is basically ""how dare you not care about my life's work"". So if you don't like the class, they'll take it personally.

To answer your question - I think we're definitely better at military might than education.

I don't have the figures in front of me but I think we spend more on the military than a lot of top nations combined. Do we have the same ratio for educational spending? Mind you - I'm not advocating increasing on educational spending until the country - including its leaders - begin to push a national drive to get teachers. This includes removing bad teachers and cut down testing. We do so much testing and so much depends on it that teachers teach for the test rather than teaching actual knowledge.

As far as aircraft, look at our enemies right now. We have an active set of wars around terrorism and I think just about any jet will do considering they have no air force. We also have smoldering remnants with Russia but there's no way we're going to war with them and if we are, the latest jet isn't going to turn the tide. I'd build more mobile bases - aircraft carriers - and research mobile, offsite, seaworthy bases - actual floating bases (with their own airfields) rather than spending billions on stationary targets.",cumyiqa,False

&gt; The bribes took place 15 years earlier. 

The Greek debt crisis was certainly in the making at least 15 years ago, and the greek government was complicit in cooking the books before that. From [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Financial_Audit,_2004):
""Up until 1994, Greece recorded very high deficits, for some years above 10% of GDP.[1][2] During the late nineties, according to the figures submitted by the Greek government to the European Union, Greece's high budget deficits were significantly lowered.[1][2] In 2000, given a deficit below 3% of GDP in 1999, Greece was accepted as the 12th member of the European monetary union.""

&gt; Also, bribery and tax-evasion are two different things.

I'd argue quite the opposite - classically, bribing the tax-collector has been a way to avoid paying a fair share of the taxes. In Greek, they even have a special word for bribing public servants. [Fakelaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakelaki):

""Transparency International, an independent corruption monitoring NGO, found that 13% of Greeks paid fakelaki (bribery in the form of envelopes with cash donations) in 2009, which was estimated to account for €787 million in yearly corruption payments.[4] At the same time it was estimated that roughly €1 billion was paid by companies in bribes to public institutions for avoiding bureaucratic rules or to get other benefits.""

Regarding Siemens, I certainly don't argue that people and companies that are responsible for illegal activities should be held accountable. But the Greek government and media have consistently [expressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-German_sentiment#Greece_and_Italy) anti-German sentiments for bailout fatigue: 

""The recent Greek government-debt crisis and EU-driven austerity measures imposed on the country have revived anti-German sentiments.[75] The Greek media have been making comments critical of the German policy, often mentioning, and drawing parallels with the Axis occupation of Greece, with some commentators emphasizing a genetic heritage from ""Goths"" or ""Huns"".[76][77] A poll by VPRC noted the existence of an anti-German sentiment in Greece, and that the majority of the respondents nowadays connect Germany with negative notions such as ""Hitler"", ""Nazism"" and ""3rd Reich"".[78] The Popular Fighters Group formed in response to the debt crisis is overtly anti-German and has targeted German organizations in Greece.""

Maybe this isn't scapegoating of Germany. Maybe the Greek government is truly trying to clean up its mess. But it seems like very convenient timing (a couple months after the Greek referendum on the very unpopular bailout provisions) for a new release for a scandal which is 15 years old (and an investigation 9 years in the making and still ongoing).

It's also important to remember that the old hearts of European cities are legacy urban areas, they have not been designed under current planning rules, so you need to look at recent developments to see the urban form that results from different planning regimens.

Germany apparently has an approach relatively similar to Japan's, in that the national government establishes a few zones, all of which allow a variety of uses, then cities have to plan urban development by zoning land in one of these zones. Here is a comparison between German and American land use planning:
http://www.archive.spia.vt.edu/SPIA/docs/shirt/The_Devil_is_in_the_Definitions.pdf

In some other countries, as I understand, by-right development is almost unheard of. By-right development meaning that anyone can build anything as long as they demonstrate it conforms to current zoning rules, without specific planner review. For example, in the UK, from what I have gathered, all developments have to be individually reviewed by local planning authorities, so in order to avoid the planning department bottlenecking developments, small-scale development is very rare, entire neighborhoods are planned and built at the same time. 

This results in extraordinarily orderly developments with entire blocks made up of slight variations of the same exact building. British planners also have a strong bias in favor of townhouses (which they call terrace) and semi-detached single-family homes, as a result, nearly 60% of British live in attached or semi-detached family homes, and only 15% live in apartments (or flats). This results in British cities being of constant mid-density all over. 

The Netherlands seem to have a similar approach, with a similar bias for attached single-family homes. Sweden also seems to rely on local planners a lot to shape developments, but they don't have as strong or consistent a bias as in the UK towards one type of housing, and favor multi-family housing much more. Which results in cities like Stockholm being full of uniform neighborhoods built in cul-de-sac made up of largely the same building, but each neighborhood being different from the other.

Sorry to hijack your post but this made me ponder something:


I wonder what the reasoning behind *""there is only 1 human species""* is. There are multiple subspecies of animals such as wolves or rhinos, sometimes with only a little difference such as color due to adapting to their local environment....which is the same driving force behind the different human racial identities. Is the different in skin color and bone structure between Europeans (Caucasian) and Africans (Negro) not sufficient enough to declare them both subspecies of the human (Homo Sapiens) species?


If (sub)species is not scientifically accurate due to not having enough difference in DNA, is race an accurate description then? Because i also hear a fair amount of *""There is only one human race""* comments.

&gt; Most of the educated middle class won’t really object to the lack of independent space, as long as they have enough ""channels for consultation"", and plenty of ""leisure and lifestyle options"".

Now, it's possible to interpret this in various ways. The metaphor that OP used paints the same situation as in Brave New World. The literal interpretation of the quote, one you have chosen to take, is that there is a conscious understanding that freedoms are being trespassed upon, but the middle class have chosen to trade it in favor of entertainment and material comfort.

Either of these, or some combination of both, is possible. There is no objective ""truth"" to an analysis like that. You are absolutely right in saying that entertainment is subjective, and that as a result, you might expect some awakening among those who don't share in the same taste in entertainment (as the main character of Brave New World did).

To answer your question directly, then, Dr CG could be saying that people will trade their freedom for entertainment. Or, he could be saying that people will blind themselves or be blinded to trespasses on their freedom, for the same. One of these interpretations will give rise to the follow-up questions you have raised, and then possibly the conclusion you have reached, in a different direction but nonetheless same vein as the OP's.

I know this is a very unsatisfying answer, but there it is.

---

In the OP, there are views that he calls ""unsavory"". In some areas in the US, of course, there might be portions of the electorate that would hold the view ""fuck the cops"". This concept comes with various ramifications, like the defunding of police organizations, the removal of police influence in an area, the stigmatization of personnel associated with the police force. This is one kind of ""unsavory opinion"" politicians are expected to distance themselves from. There are various reasons why they do this: firstly, because it is impractical; secondly, because it comes into direct conflict with a major social institution; thirdly, because it may be a socially divisive opinion.

Taking these into the Singaporean context:

**The impractical**: A significant proportion of the electorate is violently opposed to importing foreign workers. This is impractical for various reasons: One, because a lot of them fulfill the demand for low-skilled workers. Janitorial work, manual labor - jobs that people don't want, basically. Two, because those in middle management fulfill a niche that Singaporeans cannot fill. Be it the expertise, fresh perspective or talent they bring, market forces have determined that foreign talent *do* bring something that we sorely lack. Three, because we need to fight a worsening dependency ratio. When they work here, they contribute to the economy and pay taxes, which provides able bodies and money to help support our aging population. That is why the major party manifestos are very careful to tread away for the ""Singapore for Singaporeans"" route - because foreigners are an economic necessity despite any social negativities they cause, and if we are unhappy with that, we have to aim to solve the systemic issues (low birth rate, stagnating productivity growth, etc.) rather than the symptoms (cutting foreign labor import). This is not a situation unique to Singapore - immigration and asylum policies have drawn global attention, especially in the EU, and there have been nationalistic parties who have campaigned on lines of reclaiming the country for the people - with them being painted as extremists in a lot of reputable media, even though they espouse the views of their electorate.

**The juggernaut institutions**: One big one is transport. Alternative media has harped on and on about transport and we all have great jokes about how bad our transport system is. The electorate hold the view that transport should be fully nationalized, and that transport companies should be held fully accountable for their practices, their services and their fares. But even the WP, who's had the most elaborate manifesto as yet, is still hand-wavey about how exactly something like that should be done. When dealing with juggernaut institutions, politicians are very wary - they are dealing with a large and complex bureaucracy, and there is great risk of making promises relating to them: 5 years is hardly enough to navigate a juggernaut, and failing to deliver on campaign promises like that can be career suicide, particularly for an opposition. As for the incumbent, all they have to do is promise (vaguely) to work on it, and everything will soon be status quo, washed from public memory. Not to mention resistance from the institution itself - any whisper of fare cuts on the wind and the organizations are quick to point out how many buses they've added or how many more trains are running as compared to X months ago.

The last time an aspiring politician took on a social juggernaut was CPF and Roy Ngerng's clash with the PAP on accountability. We all know how that fight went, and how the event was covered in mainstream consciousness. Now, why would the WP not fight back tooth and nail in the unfair coverage of the AHPETC debacle vs the relatively ignored PA situation? Consider the role of the press as one of these juggernaut institutions in the political arena.

**The socially divisive**: There are a couple examples of this. One is racial - this is really apparent in the US; less so in Singapore. Nonetheless, racial issues have been really important here the last few years. If you notice, there have been quite a number of pieces on successful minorities that discuss their route to success; there's been pep-talk pieces that talk about the slowly shrinking gap between the Malay and Chinese standardized test scores and average educational background. And throughout Singapore's history, there's been discussions about racially-aligned affirmative action. Now, some of the electorate might hold the view that they should just have less kids and take good care of those they already have. Some might say they don't deserve extra aid, because it violates the principles of egalitarianism. 

Another issue is LGBT issues. Some hold the view that this is a country where freedom of religion is important, and since that behavior is immoral, it should remain criminal. Some might say that they don't deserve equal rights because it violates the precept of the Asian family.

You can see easily why politicians distance themselves as much as possible from these issues - it's not possible to hold a stand without alienating part of the voter base, and silence is the best, since if nobody asks, nobody has to talk about it. And there are always textbook answers to these questions that don't address the issues at all - ""we're helping them not because they're Malay but because they're Singaporean""; and ""the society is not yet developed and stable enough for us to consider such a momentous change social policies"".

Edit: So, politicians do tackle sensitive issues - it's not that they shy away from it altogether. The key point to note is ""views of the electorate"". That is, the electorate often hold extreme or divisive views on topics, while politicians learn to either avoid the divisive topics or tread gingerly around the extreme topics. And in the case of OP, he mentions 'mainstream' politicians - that is, we are not generalizing this behavior to *all* politicians (RP is a good example of one that isn't), but most politicians who intend to play the game abide by these rules.",cumzi0g,1441116319

And I thought about burning too, it only would have made sense to retrieve the parts...The guy must have REALLY wanted that sea marker. 

I didn't mean to get too far into the discussion of metal, I was sort of trying to see what sort of unusual situation would warrant such unusual behavior during the repair of a ship, and how long that may lay a crew up. They managed to build three fairly good sized buildings during their stay. One for woodwork, one for ship repair, and one for metal work. 

Would they have needed to disassemble and store their ship/and its parts while the keel was being replaced? or would it be best held up on frames sort of like a car on a lift at the garage?

As for the crappy smelter, it's likely the Greenlandic crew was unfamiliar with smelting as none was ever done in their homeland (lack of resources). So you're right in the sense that someone probably put together what they had seen before and tried their best to copy the process. Most farms had their own forge, so that would not have been totally new to them, but the forges were more for maintaining imported finished metal goods from Europe.

I'm 20 yrs old, white of eastern European origin, born and raised in Montreal, Canada. I've been listening to hip-hop my whole life but only in the last few years have these racial issues become an important part of how I think about hip-hop as an art form. 
I remember sitting in a hotel room in Chicago with my white immigrant parents watching the Trayvon Martin trial and verdict. Now my parents are neither particularly liberal or have a huge number of black friends, but I remember both of them being appalled by the verdict. ""This country (the US) is fucking insane"" said my dad. Almost never have I heard these pro-Zimmerman (or pro-cop) arguments where I'm from. There seems to be somewhat of a consensus that the USA is a country paralyzed by paranoia with racial undertones.
 
You see to me, and even as a young kid, hip-hop was a beautiful symbol of unity. When I look at the US from my perspective I can't help but think that a lot of the racial issues stem from it still being a very segregated place. The way I grew up, through both elementary and middle/high school, being white was the minority: the majority was a balanced mix of black, Arab, Asian and Latino with a whole heap of other stuff mixed in. Growing up in the late 90's and early 2000's, hip-hop always seemed to me like the obvious music of our generation, rather than the music of a specific minority (which it also is). You see we all listened equally to 50 and Em, but we also were exposed to both white, black, Arab Montreal rappers and white, black, Arab rappers from France and so on. Pretty quickly I was also tuned into rap from my own country Serbia. 

This is not to pretend that Montreal, Canada is some kind of mystical land where there are no racial issues or racist people, of course there are black and white and Arab neighborhoods, but as a whole our culture is much more divided among French/English language lines than racial ones: the west is mainly anglophone like Jamaicans, Pakistanis, Hindus, etc and the east is francophone such as Haitians, Algerians, etc. One thing is for sure tho, talk to a teen-to-20something on either side and you won't have much trouble finding a hip-hop head. 

That's why I spent the majority of my life as a hip-hop fan not giving too much weight to the racial issues central to the art form, although the events of the last few years have definitely changed that. I hope that this culture I love, and still believe to be the art form of a generation can be a part of the solution and a vehicle for positive change in how we experience and talk about race.",cumzuhl,False

There is for example also a theory that Australia wasn't settled in one wave, but three, linking aborigines to several other populations in South Asia. However this theory became very unpopular because Aborigines feared it would undermine their claims if their ancestors weren't *the* first. Which is in my opinion a bit nonsensical because between these migrations and the colonisation by europeans are still several thousand years in between. The same goes for the Americas, which were almost certainly settled in different waves, latest are the ancestors of the Eskimo-Aleut peoples.  
Some time ago I watched a documentation about finding of 40k old sceletons in Brazil which suggested that the first inhabitants of the Americas were not the direct (althought they probably mixed heavily and assimilated) ancestors to modern Native Americans.  

There is also the Ice Bridghe theory, which imho is pretty far fetched and probably false anyway, which states that the first inhabitants of the American came along an ice bridge from Europe to America. Natives, justifyingly fear that this will be used to undermine their cause, because it would render Europeans as Natives of the Americas. 
Imho even if it were true, which is unlikely, it wouldn't give Europeans any right to the Americas, first because I find this ""our ancestors X-thousand years ago lived there somewhere"" is not a justification for stealing land, and second because the ancestors to most of modern europeans (except Basques) didn't even lived at the time in europe when the ice Bridge migration was said to happen.

You probably don't even know why the black community started hating the word 'negro'. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American#Political_overtones

&gt;The term African American carries important political overtones. Earlier terms used to describe Americans of African ancestry referred more to skin color than ancestry, and were conferred upon the group by colonists and Americans of European ancestry; people with dark skins were considered inferior in fact and in law. The terms (such as colored, person of color, or negro) were included in the wording of various laws and legal decisions which some thought were being used as tools of white supremacy and oppression.[191] There developed among blacks in America a growing desire for a term of self-identification of their own choosing.

&gt;With the political consciousness that emerged from the political and social ferment of the late 1960s and early 1970s, blacks no longer approved of the term Negro. They believed it had suggestions of a moderate, accommodationist, even ""Uncle Tom"" connotation. In this period, a growing number of blacks in the United States, particularly African-American youth, celebrated their blackness and their historical and cultural ties with the African continent.

&gt;In the 1980s the term African American was advanced on the model of, for example, German-American or Irish-American to give descendants of American slaves and other American blacks who lived through the slavery era a heritage and a cultural base.


Essentially, in the post civil rights act era, black people found 'negro' to be dated and thought it had too much of a negative connotation. They then embraced 'black' and 'African American'.

Though it's not immediately obvious you WILL be racially profiled based on this (usually negatively if you're black, or positively as a matter of token racism or if you fill out asian in technical field).

What the flying fuck is that supposed to mean? Why should ethnicity or race matter at all? To non-americans this is just bizarre. In europe nobody cares if you're chinese, pakistani, pole or some other nationality. Sure we have racism there, but it's usually individual (ie individual hate groups, neonazis etc), not systematically ingrained in society.

Back to the profiling - you're either fit for the position or not, you should be judged as a person, not a member of race. It's institutional racism in america like this at the root of everything.

It's difficult to comment on movements like BLM. They're only interested only in problems of their group. Some of their activity seems productive (calls to end institutionalized racism, racial profiling and segregation), some of it not (unreasonable calls for AA, reparations for slavery etc). But their focus is limited and as such not very effective across the board. They don't care about latinos or other groups collectively discriminated against as a matter of ""normal"" everyday society.

That's tackling the wrong ends - band aiding the symptoms, not root causes. America is culturally racist and it's perceived as normal. Attempts to reform it are sometimes grotesque lip service and tokenism. It's the same way how patriarchy is perceived as ""normal"", but feminism calls it out correctly - it applies pressure on the system as such, no such thing as ""single mom lives matter"", but ""females matter"".",cun2xrq,False

They have biggest chance of upsets and are pretty good at the bo1 format.

Idem pour les italiens. Tu as certainement entendu rital ou polak c'étaient des vrais insultes au même titres que pédé peut l'être.

On a envie que tout aille plus vite, mais la réalité est que changer les mentalités prend du temps, l'état ne peut rien imposer sur le sujet, la presse non plus, vivre ensemble et se côtoyer est le moyen le plus simple de faire avancer les choses. 

La représentation des gens dans les médias aussi permet de faire évoluer les choses ou d'éduquer les jeunes. Par représentation, je ne parle pas de mettre du nombre mais de la qualité, un homosexuel dans une série n'a pas besoin d'être une caricature (soit efféminé, maniéré soit bodybuildé et rasé de près sur tout le corps), mais avoir un homo d'apparence et de comportement ""normal"" qui fait des choses que l'on ferait tous les jours comme dans Brokeback Mountain ou dans The Imitation Game (ok c'était une caricature de nerd) est un bon moyen de montrer aux gens qu'après tout, on est tous pareils. Quelqu'un avec qui n'importe qui peut s'identifier malgré l'homosexualité du personnage est un bon moyen de faire avancer les mœurs. Mais les producteurs sont souvent ancrés dans la caricature, et surtout la facilité. Bref je m'égare.

Tiens, un autre exemple à la con qui me passe par la tête, la littérature S-F utilise souvent la polygamie libre (une femme avec plusieurs maris et/ou femmes, ou un homme avec plusieurs femmes et/ou maris) dans les civilizations les plus avancées. J'ai rarement vu ça en image avant Caprica (le spin-off moyen de Battlestar Galactica) et j'avoue que ça m'a fait bizarre et je pense que si ça m'arrivait d'être dans un foyer comme ça il me faudrait pas mal de temps pour être à l'aise. Ça n'a rien d'immoral entre adultes consentants, mais ce serait tellement alien comme situation que je serai pas à mon aise tout de suite. Un peu comme la première fois que tu manges avec une famille japonaise et que t'es assis par terre, les pieds sous une nappe avec un réchaud au milieu de la table. Ou la première fois que tu manges réunionnais et que dès la première bouchée tu sais que tes intestins vont prendre cher.

Tu n'es jamais à l'aise quand quelque chose est nouveau, être directement en contact avec quelqu'un d'ouvertement homosexuel qui va parler de son/sa compagnon naturellement est une chose étrange de prime abord. Ce n'est pas être homophobe que de sentir bizarre, surpris, gêné par une situation nouvelle c'est que je voulais dire par ""avant de demander la tolérance, il faut être tolérant avec ceux qui ne le sont pas.""",cun3vfr,False

Its clear that the average FPS fan doesn't care about an eSport that doesn't apply to them.

eSports has to think of the fans first, otherwise nobody cares, just like in TF2, or any PC FPS outside of CS:GO.  Fans are players too, and if watching pro players makes the fans feel more empowered for their own play, that is a main driver for people watching eSports.

*WHY SHOULD* britian help these people? Dont you think we have helped enough people in the past? Have you seen how many migrants Britain is currently hosting? There has been over 300,000 this year. 

Why cant they be encouraged to go to Romania, Bulgaria, or any other eastern European country? They could perhaps be a huge help in getting those countries economies going.

These people don't have health insurance, they aren't going to pay to send their kids to private schools, they arent going to have jobs lined up. Who is going to pay for the strain these people will put on an already overstretched public services and welfare budget? Who is going to build the houses for them to live in? there is already a *massive* shortage of housing in the UK. Why should the UK suffer from wage compression as the migrants offer cheap labour?

They still have around 2/3's of their population in poverty and they are reaching the tipping point in terms of production vs demand of production. Essentially, they are maxing out their output and there isn't any growth in the demand for cheap labor (beyond much of the developing worlds ability to provide said cheap labor). Cheap labor is great, but many of the high end objects of today's world are produced by machines. You need engineers to produce these machines and very few unskilled labor jobs to upkeep the manufacturing process. My company automated several years ago. We didn't see a decrease of head count, rather we saw a shift from skilled labor to professionals. We went from alot of HS diploma types to people with engineering degrees from Stanford, and our capacity has went up 400 percent, whilst our human cost has increased by only single digits. This happens in manufacturing. Quality is essential and machines do do a better job than a skilled hand, for electronics and many modern day products. Also, the engeneering in China is shoddy at best. If you want a quality product, its most likely globally sourced, and manufactured in the 1st world (US or Europe). If you want cheap, copied shit, buy it from China. China has zero innovation as well. They have very little IP, most of their ""goods"" are copies from the west.

Daily, I like to check it regularly during the day.

&gt;How often do you visit /r/europe?

It is part of my daily subreddit rotation so pretty often.

&gt;What country are you normally resident in?

France

&gt;Do you speak any languages besides English? (If yes: which and to what level?)

French (native), Italian (fluent), I can read very basic russian but I am pretty shit honestly.

&gt;What interests you about Europe?

I love the cultural diversity mainly. More precisely food but not only. 

&gt;What are your favourite and least favourite things about /r/europe ?

Favorite : being able to discuss about science, culture and history with other europeans without annoying Americans interfering. 

Least favorite: Even though I am for a pretty strict control of immigration I feel like there is a clear overload of immigration posts and I feel like something can be done about it without necessarily needing censorship.

&gt;Do you have experience as a moderator or similar?

Nope

&gt;Why do you want to be a moderator?

I want to beat /u/dClauzel as the most hated french person on /r/europe. More sincerely I feel like the mods here are often criticized, sometimes with reasons. I want to try and make a difference. 

&gt;Why do you think you would be a good moderator?

I am good at not taking insults personally. 

&gt;Do you have any expirence with statistics, datamining or reddit bots?

Nope, but I live in the same city as dClauzel, I am sure I could discuss all that with him around a good pint of beer.

&gt;What is your opinion on the immigration megathread? What do you think went wrong (if anything)?

I think the starting idea was okey but that it was not followed through (at some point new pieces of news were not updated in the original post). It should have been made clearer that everything immigration-related had to be posted in the megathread.

&gt;What's one weakness you have?

Cheese. I literally cannot resist a good piece of cheese.

Do I get to choose the place? If I can somehow attract the duck sized horses to a funnel of some sort I am pretty confident that I could prevail. The horse sized duck sounds like a pretty impossible fight.

Firstly it is how we play, in the last year we have been painstakingly boring to watch. We pass around the back fluffing around, lose possession in critical areas, and just don't have a unified attack at all. I looked at West Ham and honestly wish we could attack like that. Their pace and energy was hon stay brilliant. And there have been many instances where I have honestly thought that we are by far one of the worst attacking sides in the PL in recent months. We sink long shots and lucky goals but those are individual brilliance not BR brilliance. Without those goals, we would have been lucky to finish 8th last season.

Secondly and perhaps most importantly it is his fucking player preferences. Allen, bless him, is a mediocre squad player. Why is he given so much preference. We have other options?

Do not even get me started on Lovren, I honestly think he is the worst defender in the PL. No mental composure, not a huge amount of physicality, and just a terrible terrible defender. His performances this season even have been masked by luck, and the fact that he is still played is a joke. Now you can make the argument that Lovren performs in training. Well more so than anything I put that on BR, it is his job to put that training to the pitch, if a defender doesn't have composure train with him to improve that. 

The markovic situation has annoyed me a great deal as well. One because I think any other manager would have turned him into a class talent by now. Maybe not world class, but not loaned out to Fernerbache (not that they are a bad team, they are better than us now). Two because it seems to highlight that he isn't taking the Europa seriously.

Which leads me to his utter lack of experience in Europe. To me Europe is where tactics matter the most. We have teams with a quarter of our budget destroying us. Europe means adaptability, mental toughness and a host of factor that BR lacks. 

Tack on to that his stupid comments in the press, his pure stubbornness in games in regards to formations. And his utter stupidity when it comes to man management. As well as the fact that I think he is an FSG push over.

I just don't want him as a manager. I was so sure Klopp would come in last year and when he didn't I was positive we would be terrible this season too.

The fetus/embryo was alive, but now isn't because of the direct and intentional action of the doctor, ie killed.  The fact that the mother consented or the manner in which the child was killed is unimportant; there is still a net loss of one human life.

&gt; I'm not just talking about the US troops. When you invade a country, people who are in that country tend to die as well, more so than the troops who are invading. If you add those up, they quickly outnumber your figure of 58 million. I mean, the American Indian Wars alone killed tens of millions of natives. And these are full human beings, not fetuses who were removed in unwanted or dangerous pregnancies.

For many years the estimated civilian casualty ratio was 90%.  Using that number, the total US casualty count, including civilians, rises to 30 million.  Still less than 58,000,000.  In fact, the 90% number has recently been debunked, and 50% is a more accurate number (putting us at 6 million.)

The US Census Bureau estimates about 45,000 Indians died in the American Indian Wars.  As for the Trail of Tears, slightly more than 46,000 were moved, so the death toll is going to be significantly less than that.  This does not even break 100,000, let alone tens of millions.  Not to diminish the tragedy of it, but the deaths from small pox and other illnesses brought from Europe don't really count since the settlers had no idea that it would effect the natives so.

However, you are correct.  If we somehow counted every single death caused, funded, or involved with the US, it would surely be much more than 58 mil.  But the fact is that abortion deaths still outnumber police and military casualties put together.

&gt; The problem with that is life is continuous. If you consider zygotes human beings then you also have to consider eggs and sperms as human beings, in which case we'd have to outlaw sexual intercourse since many sperms die during that. So where does it end?

I agree.  Your liver is alive too, and we can agree that it is not a human.  But a zygote will become a human under natural circumstances, and your liver won't.

You are correct, life is continuous.  You also said that you oppose abortion after 28-30 weeks. What happens at the moment the baby turns 29 weeks old that gives it the right to life?  We can never know exactly when a fetus feels pain/is viable/etc..  In fact, it is not a sudden change, but a gradual one.  How can you measure something as important as the life or death of a human with an error range of 336 hours?

A word is also meaningless if you assign it several grossly conflicting meanings. Almost nobody in western Europe believes that Jesus is literally the ""son of god"". Current popular thinking here is that he was just a generally wise person and ""great moral teacher"". The same people also usually reject the notion of a personalized god, and define god as ""something bigger"", ""love"", ""goodness"" or even ""the universe"". 

That doesn't stop any of them from calling themselves christians, or from belonging to the big churches whose doctrines drastically conflict these views, but who know better than to protest because they fear for their membership numbers.

German christians are typically deists or pantheists too ignorant to know that they aren't christians. The church keeps happily including them into their membership numbers, because those numbers of people whose beliefs they supposedly represent gives them insane political power.

&gt;If someone rejects their baptism they're not a Christian

What about people who don't give a fuck? Because that's fairly standard practice all over europe: People get splashed as babies, and never care about religion ever again. Until of course they get kids themselves and decide to splash them too, because catholic grade school has less immigrants.

These people are thoroughly worldly. They identify as christian solely because that's what they've been told they are all their life. It means nothing to them. 

I've never been a christian, but I only left the church after I got old enough to care about organisations systematically covering up the rape of children.",cun7ic0,False

They are starting from the end and working backwards and as soon as they come up with 1 solution inside their mind they assume it must be true.

Well ADHD is a collection of many genes and people have different gene versions of these genes.  There is not 1 single gene that causes ADHD, most genes versions will only increase the chance of you being ADHD from 10 to 50%, but when you have more of these genes the more likely you are to be ADHD.

And it is not just genetics but how the enivorment further adds to the genetics.  If specific things happen to you and your mother when she was pregnant or during your first 5 years of life you are more likely to be ADHD for this is when critical parts of your brain area forming.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;



ADHD is a disorder of the outside brain such as the frontal lobe but also the outside sensory and perception lobe (the parietal lobe)  not working as well as it should with the areas between the left and right and the areas we call subcortical areas.  

* [Picture 1](http://mybrainonline.ca/cms_doc_image.php?image=00000050) the outside brain and the 4 main lobes

* [Picture 2](http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/human-brain-anatomy-lobes-beautiful-colorful-illustration-detailed-sagittal-view-isolated-white-background-54987873.jpg) Where it says limbic lobe that is the anterior cingulate, not all of the limbic also sometimes called the emotion generative areas are shown. [Picture 3](https://o.quizlet.com/bGkAr7BSWqKwUwfmA5dY0A.png) shows the greater limbic system, which does incorporate some of the frontal lobe past the anterior cingulate

* [Picture 4](http://7e.biopsychology.com/vs/vs02/vs0209.png) The Subcortical areas, everything besides that 1 first color is subcortical it is below the cortex aka the outer lobes.

The subcortical areas are very inside aspects of such as the cerebellum, the thalamus, the brainstem, and the basal ganglia.  All of the subcortical brain areas are what incorporate and take lots of ideas from the outer area and then incorporate them into a single story or purpose taking cognition (thoughts), emotions, and natural / automatic behaviors and creating one single form of goal directed action.  Now those natural and automatic behaviors which is separate from emotion and cognition are sometimes called instinctual behaviors but they are much more than that, they are a source of drive and energy and motivation, and when they are align with your emotions and cognition correctly you have perseverance and willpower.  But when these brain regions do not form correctly at certain ages or are damaged your brain finds it harder to coordinate these 3 important necessary human behaviors as a single will.  You are now much more likely to be impulsive, or inattentive to some things while you also hyperfocus on the wrong things.  The pregnancy and the first 5 years of life are of critical importance for this is when these subcortical regions form and while the outer brain will continue to form till your 30s you get no backsies if something happens during this crucial period.

&amp;nbsp;

Remember 1 or 2 single genes do not cause ADHD but these 1 or 2 single genes may be an advantage to the person in ways that you did not even think of for genes influencing dopamine and norepinephrine and such operate on 100+ important very different things.  In other words 1 or 2 ADHD genes may be an advantage but when you get a dozen or so they are actually a disadvantage.

For example the media likes saying the DRD4 7r allele which is a well known ADHD risk gene causing a mild form of ADHD unless you have lots of other ADHD risk genes.  Well the medial likes to say this a novelty seeking gene, based off 1 paper from the 1990s which did not state it as fact but just a hypothesis.  This is because people with this gene often are more restless and novelty seeking.  The media and such continued the hypothesis from the 1990s paper and said this gene is the reason why people left Africa and went to Asia and then Europe and the Americas.  That the DRD4 7R are natural explorers and its because of this specific gene instead of the 30,000 other genes you have and the combinations those genes make for they have affects on each other.

Well there has been metareviews that have studied this gene and there analysis after going through 3 dozen+ studies said the chances of this gene's influence on novelty seeking is slim, for it is rarely replicated and it is not predictive, if it does have an effect on novelty seekings its effect is less than 3%. [Link](http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(07)00327-7/abstract)

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**How this same gene which affects ADHD may be an advantage completely unrelated to ADHD**

So let me continue how when you look backwards try to create a theory and then assume it must be true that you can make lots of mistakes.  Well that same ADHD risk gene DRD4 7R is also known for less sensitivity for rewards and when to know to stop and for encouraging various forms of addiction.  It is also known to create a seasonal form of depression.

[Well one study found that](http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v31/n11/full/1301121a.html) that women with this gene are more likely to have this seasonal depresesion, and higher body mass index, and they eat more during specific times of the year.

They later go on this may have encouraged the survival of the children of these women, and also may have influenced reproductive choice in harsh environments for these women were less likely to starve.  This depression while sucks in today's time actually causes the women to use less energy during the winter, for you have less motor behavior but it also influences how your body works with its metabolism with things like insulin.

It even has epigenetic effects on the fetus, for it uses melatonin which is one of the ways your brain keeps track of when its day and night and when to sleep but also has effects on when your brain knows what season it is, and what genes to turn on.  This melatonin effect changes the actual fetus when the mom is pregnant in the 2nd and 3rd trimester to actually encourage the baby to see resources as finite and thus encourage this hoarding of resources behavior.  Turning on these genes via melatonin actually causes the dopamine system to form slightly differently in the fetus  literally changing the nerve cells now and how it will form later in the future to be more sensitive to the seeking out of reward.  It also encourages **emotional eating** when you are stressed you turn to food and other dopamine inducing substances such as drugs of abuse.

I think the Allies would start dropping the bomb almost immediately in this scenario.  One of their big motivators was to prevent the loss of allied life, so as soon as it was game on, they're dropping on Moscow and whatever other big cities are left in the USSR in order to prevent the massacre of their armies in Europe.  

The need is immediate in this scenario, and conventional warfare trashes cities just as much as the atom bombs do, so the Allied High Command does some quick math and goes all in immediately.  The question is, do they drop in Germany to destroy army units or hope that they surrender when their cities back home are destroyed?

Asylum seekers gain £35 per week in cash benefits, plus let's assume it's £200 a month for accommodation (probably way more but whatever) &amp; £30 a week for food (both non cash). So we're paying out £460 per month per asylum seeker. That's £55 million per year for 10k asylum seekers, which I'm sure is massively lower than it actually is but there you go. Now imagine, how much could £55 million help people living in refugee camps in Lebanon, or Jordan, or Turkey? Spending money here, especially in London where many of these refugees end up, one of the most expensive cities on the planet, just seems completely bizarre &amp; counterproductive. I can't help but think it would be better for the refugee problem at large (which is primarily in the Middle East you have to bear in mind, almost no asylum seekers actually come to the EU) to help fund centres closer to the problem. 

Of course the problem you have is these refugees are already here, and so we must deal with them, if not us then some other European state. I don't actually think they should be in Europe, for the reasons I've outlined above, but while they're here (and we can't send them somewhere with a lower cost of living) I think doing our fair share sounds reasonable. But if we do this it should be an EU wide sharing scheme. We'd probably have to manage 20-30k more claims than we currently do would be my guess (45-55k per year). 

The other issue, of course, is bogus claims. Last time I did the math on this a little under 50% of asylum seekers claims were rejected. There needs to be some way to deport these people, at the moment the process is ridiculously hard, there are thousands living here that should have been deported already. If we're going to have a migrant sharing scheme the EU needs to give some guarantees that we're actually going to be able to deport these people if they're not genuine asylum seekers.",cun9ylk,1441133373

There is an insane amount of effort that goes into localizing a game. Translating, voice acting, possible licensing conflicts and plenty of other things I wouldn't even think of. For instance, for Blizzard to release the Wrath of the Lich King expansion of World of Warcraft in China, they had to change a crap ton of content because the laws in China simply wouldn't allow for the content to be released. Which actually brings another good point. Dragon's Dogma Online would have to compete with WoW, and as much as I personally don't like WoW, everyone else does, and it's very difficult to convince a massive population of people already who've already dedicated hundreds of hours of gameplay making friends, getting the best gear, etc, to just walk away from that and start all over with something completely different (which most WoW players would probably have to pay X amount upgrading their computers to play anyway).

TL:DR - There isn't a ""Localization"" button. It's a lot of time and money, and a promise of 7500 purchases (under half a million @ 60$ USD) isn't enough to commit to the effort of localizing an entire MMO and all it's future updates/expansions.",cunbjqy,False

I'm from the North-West, which has a fairly large immigrant population (compared to a lot of the country).

In my experience (anecdotal and from reading up) immigration of unskilled persons generally hurt an economy / society, especially if these people are claiming to be 'refugee's' like a lot of those coming from the Middle East.

Britain's benefit system is one of the worst / best in Europe. The show 'Benefit Street', not an exaggeration. I've known so many people, and stopped talking to a lot of friends because they were abusing the benefits system (I'm talking about people living on the dole, not looking for work for multiple months and years) and living better than those of us who actually work.

This makes Britain and the UK a very popular choice for people seeking to immigrate 'for a better life'. The problem is that our governments (all of them) use this as great propaganda, they won't reduce benefits because such a large portion of the population use them in some way (every single parent, single or coupled, regardless of choices receive Child Benefits for example) and that would damage their chances for election, but they can still point at the immigrants to distract the populous from actual issues. The whole Calais issue could be resolved within a month if they actually wanted to fix it (provide France with UK border controller / Police staff to aid with the expulsion of camps). The fact that the government won't crack down on these immigrants (and encourages labelling them as refuges) just encourages more of them to come here.

From a societal point if view, large numbers of immigrants tend to create their own culture, at the expulsion of the local one. Almost every person I've met around my age that identifies themselves as 'Asian' (which is incredibly Racist in of itself) or Pakistani are British. They were born, and raised in Britain. As were their parents and grandparents. Most have never even been to Pakistan, yet they still refuse to integrate into the local culture.

A core component of American grand strategy has revolved around preventing the rise of another regional hegemon from emerging on the Eurasian landmass.  The reasons should be pretty clear - because the United States faces no serious geopolitical threats from the Americas, it's able to project power across the Oceans in a way that no other country has ever been able to (think about the importance Mahan has has to US strategy).  

Similarly, a Japanese hegemon in Asia or a German hegemon in Europe would face no serious local threats, assuming the USSR fell, and would then theoretically be in a position to project power across the Pacific and the Atlantic respectively, giving them the ability to challenge American interests in the future.

A Japanese or German hegemon (and certainly both!) would absolutely threaten one or the other with gaining control over the Mackinderian global ""Heartland"" in the then USSR (which, incidentally, he was talking about in 1943).  That would make it near impossible to balance against either challenge, and producing internally facing BoP systems is integral to American policy for that reason.

Now, to suggest that Germany (a world-rate military and industrial power in the 1940s) or Japan (the most powerful regional power and on par with numerous European states in military terms at the time)  are somehow less of a threat than even a nuclear Iran (with conventional capabilities 35 years out of date and average to low industrial capabilities) sounds absolutely insane.

Nuclear weapons are powerful *deterrents*, not offensive weapons.  Nuclear weapons in Iran wouldn't enable it to pursue regional hegemony unopposed - it would only make invasion and regime change markedly less likely.  There's no threat there to the United States (directly - obviously it would limit US potential options in the region).  There most certainly was a direct threat from Germany and Japan, so I have no idea why you'd oppose WWII and support an attack on Iran.  It seems fundamentally incompatible with strategic reality.

**tl;dr:**  Japan and German were modernized, powerful militaries threatening to establish hegemony and even potentially control Mackinder's Heartland, allowing either to project power across the Pacific or Atlantic.  Iran is a regional power with seriously out-of-date capabilities that in no way can project power in a serious way against the US, and even a nuclear weapon wouldn't change that, and is nowhere *near* as threatening.",cunc5uq,False

In India there is a massive amount of poverty and much worse living standards, therefore if we totally opened the borders with them there would be an earth-shattering wave of mass migration from India to here, which would mean the end of Britain.

Well that's a load of (entirely expected) trash on several levels.

1) The Commonwealth includes countries like Singapore, which actually has a great HDI than we do. I notice that Singapore is not included in this list. Indeed, even countries like Brunei have HDI's higher than some EU countries. _I wonder if this is a coincidence_.

2) Poverty within a country does not necessarily lead to 'earth-shattering waves of mass migration'. We have our own problems with poverty - but we do not have out own downtrodden emigrating in huge numbers to countries which are on the same continent with better social security (such as Denmark). Nevermind talking about countries on the other side of the sodding Earth! Do you think that those in poverty have the ability to generate plane tickets out of thin air or something?

I didn't actually claim that. And even if I _was_ trying to claim that, your comment history is strewn with more than enough damning evidence for that.

This 'why are the nasty lefties picking on me for my 'perfectly reasonable' request' charade is tedious.

I don't need to call you names when your own actions speak for themselves.

That much wealth and material goods makes this question difficult. Having enough money to cover 6 months of living expenses in medieval Europe alone would make you a prime target for bandits. Add to that enough food to supply you for 6 months only makes you a more enticing target. Additionally, it makes it that much more difficult to integrate into society - you have food and money which you must be ready to account for. Theoretically, I could just become a hermit for 6 months and survive off of my personal effects for at least that long

To answer the question, the first order of business would be to find a way in to society. I would seek out a church or monastery and arrive as a beggar, but before that I would have to do something about my outlandish (futuristic) attire...

Scenario 1: I'd set up a small camp somewhere secluded. I'd hunt or scavenge enough to clothe myself in skins and woven materials. I'd abandon my futuristic supplies (save a small amount of money) and, dressed as a savage, I'd find a nearby church or monastery to begin integration into society. My story would be I've lost my memory and last thing recollected is being ""raided by bandits"". This would cover my sudden appearance, explain the primitive clothing (a lot better than having to explain Levi jeans or Nike sneakers), and provide reasoning to my peculiar linguistics. As soon as I could communicate with them, I'd determine whether I'd want to stay with the clergy or attempt to leave. Either way, I'd *look like* the locals at this point.

Scenario 2: I find some out of the way homestead. I study the inhabitants for several days to better understand their language. I eventually approach them, offering a large chunk of my money and food in exchange for clothing and their silence (they'll likely figure me for either a disgraced noble or a warlock/sorcerer of some sort - either way, bad news if it made its way to where I was headed).

Dressed for the period, I'd then make my way to the nearest town. By this point, I should have a basic understanding of the language enough to be able to communicate with others (if traveling abroad has taught me anything, is that ""no"" is a universal language and grunting/pointing at things goes a long way). I'd constantly observe those around me and continually shape my behavior to the populace; the less attention I draw to myself, the better.

I don't possess any skill by trade, but I know a little bit about lots of things and learn quickly. I'd more than likely start off my new life as a cook, though. I'd try to make arrangements to cook for people in exchange for living quarters. While a lot of flavorings and seasonings we take for granted today aren't available at this time, a few are - wood for smoking, for example. Also available (if in a coastal region) is salt, in the form of seawater (which could be used for brines, stocks, etc).

Cooking for self and others also controls my exposure to food-borne illness. While I still would be very prone to contagious diseases of the era. 

**TL;DR - I'd lay low and try to bring as little attention to myself as possible. I'd observe the locals and mimic their behavior. If asked for any kind of personal ""history"", my story would be amnesiac with the last memory being attacked by bandits/raiders.**",cuncice,False

No, but then again, it's not Poland that's busy invading Ukraine. It is pretty sad though that a country with a GDP not much larger than that of Florida is probably most prepared to resist Russian aggression and most willing to take responsibility for its own defense.

It's pretty obvious that Europe to you is mainly Scandinavia, the UK, France and Germany, but then again I shouldn't be surprised, [Democrats don't have a history of giving much of a shit about Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_betrayal#Yalta).

And even if Europe could resist a Russian incursion, if you think there's any chance of them fielding some ""European army"" to gallantly ride to Estonia's aid, you're plainly ignorant of European politics. Angela Merkel would sell them out in an eyeblink if it means Germany will keep getting its natural gas.

&gt;And America could just waltz into all those countries, occupy them within a few months relatively easily with few casualties, right?

No, and neither can Russia. Just because wars are bloody and messy though, doesn't mean nobody's going to start one. Donetsk and Lugansk is a small, fairly populated area and there has been a full-blown war over it for the past year.

Would you rather spend money preventing a war or cleaning up after it?

&gt; What happens when you put a bunch of bloodthirsty, music-loving goblins together? Well, a lot of disembowelment, but also a lot of catchy tunes. Formed six millennia ago, and practicing only every other leap year on a full moon, the band has perfected their brand of crushing goblin metal.

&gt; On a cold, dreary winter night in July of 2006, Nicholas Von Doom and Tim were in the woods engaging in general tomfoolery when they stumbled upon a mysterious cardboard box with their names crudely inscribed with a Sharpie® Permanent Marker. Inside they found a letter handwritten in blood instructing them to write and record an album about the destruction of mankind at the hands of small, hideous creatures. Additionally, it mentioned that failure to complete this task would result in gruesome death. The letter was signed, ""goblins"".

&gt; Frightened and still a little buzzed, Nicholas and Tim immediately ran back into their cave and began frantically writing melodies and rhythms using an assortment of straws, whistles, and wooden spoons. The amalgamation of these sounds and Von Doom's indecipherable yelling soon became known to the world as NEKROGOBLIKON. The collection of music created that night was eventually named Goblin Island and was unleashed upon the world on January 1st, 2007. After receiving much Internet acclaim and a couple Grammys, Nicholas and Tim were relieved, assuming the goblins must have been satisfied. However, a couple years later another cardboard box appeared nearby their cave.

&gt; The goblins wanted more. Not just more music, but more people performing it, more silly instruments being used, and more Sharpies. Tim and Nicholas proceeded to kidnap four strangers and force them to help do the goblins' bidding. After another two years of writing, recording, drinking, and compulsive snacking, the new lineup of NEKROGOBLIKON released their sophomore album STENCH, which garnered them even more accolades. Rolling Stone raved about the album, calling it ""the most dazzling album of the year."" The LA Times stated ""one can't help but be dazzled by STENCH."" Even Paul McCartney praised the album, saying ""if the degree to which I was dazzled was measured by volumes of water, STENCH would be an ocean.""

&gt; At the goblins' command, NEKROGOBLIKON went on to perform these songs in public for months with the sole purpose of frightening children. This resulted in even further success for the band, eventually leading to them fully enslaving the Internet and being invited to shriek at innocent people at large musical festivals in Europe. ""Surely, the goblins must be satisfied by now"" thought the band. Weeks later another box appeared...

&gt; NEKROGOBLIKON is proudly endorsed by Vic Firth, Halo Guitars, The Mountain Clothing, and Sharpie. Read more on Last.fm.

If you go back up you'll see that I got more for my tax money.  I'm not going to beat a dead horse but I get more for my tax money there.  Americans like to choose whether they're going to pay these things but I'd argue, as would experts, that living in countries where you get lots of paid leave to be with your family, affordable health care, affordable daycare, a pension, free education, etc contributes to a higher quality of life.

You mentioned Colombia.  I'm sure the average is low but if you're a middle class professional you make enough to own your home mortgage free in 5-7 years, have a maid and cook, and have enough disposable income for a really nice lifestyle.  I would much rather be poor in the US but middle class?  My friends do better here than my american friends.  Of course both countries are lacking quite a few things that I think the Europeans really got right.

Just look around you.  How many of your friends have the time and money to go on several vacations a year?  In my case almost none.  They go camping for a week and might go to Mexico or Hawaii for another.  In Colombia we get there weeks minimum vacation and like 19 paid holidays.  Salaries are high enough to spend a month in Europe flying into Madrid for the middle class.  I just did it with a group last summer.  This year I'm going to Mexico and the US and in January a month in Asia or Africa.

How many of your friends are enjoying that grand or more for daycare?

How many are saving up the hundreds of thousands if dollars that will be needed to just survive during retirement?  I personally don't subscribe to the notion that it's acceptable for most Americans to live on $1600 a month in their golden years.

How many have job security?

You get my point.

I will tell you one thing and that's about poverty.  There's serious poverty in Colombia.  They have improved from 45% to about 30% in recent years but it's still significant.  Living in a country with high poverty reduces your quality of life.  Europe has very low poverty and it's a much nicer place to live.  The US scares me since we have a fair amount if poverty and its getting worse.   As things get worse the security situation will worsen.  Will you let your kids ride their bikes across town?  Can you use your phone out on the street or pull your camera out?  Are there beggars everywhere, home invasions, etc?  The key is to minimize poverty so that you live a richer lifestyle.  Thus doesn't mean paying everyone $50k a year but it means keeping people from having to choose between crime or being hungry.",cundau4,1441138317

And the fortune will be split between the people who cook his food, design and construct his cars and house and what not. Hard workers who I think people of all political persuasions agree should get it. 

A rich person who stays rich still needs a source of income. That means they have to contribute to society, in a way that people continue voluntarily giving them money. Are there rich Americans who had rich slave owning ancestors or wealth stemming from European nobility? Without a doubt. But there are countless more poor Americans who can also trace a portion of their family to rich folks who squandered it. 

So to answer your question - aside from property rights why do the rich ""deserve"" to keep their money? Because the two options given to them are 1) gradually give their money to the hard workers allowing them to maintain their life style. 2) find a way to contribute to the economy that helps everyone in the USA.

&gt;Piglet was an import people wanted to see fail to protect some sort of NA mystique. From camping bot constantly in solo q to, casters. 

I have no idea about solo queue, but plenty of people wanted to see him succeed in NA. And the casters didn't want to see him fail. Sure, they talked a lot about his poor performances when he first showed up, but they did that because *that's their fucking job*, not because of some pro-NA conspiracy. A former world champion comes to NA and then (at least at the start) fails to live up to the hype? *Of course* that's going to be a major storyline the casters discuss a lot. 

&gt; it started with LMQ who received countless harassment also when they would go into solo q because they were an all Chinese team.

Everyone gets harassed in soloqueue. But the idea that LMQ were disliked for being a Chinese team is bullshit. Go back to last year and look at threads about them; they were beloved among NA fans. More popular than many of the all-NA teams, in fact...

&gt;Imagine how baseball or Soccer or Hockey would look if we only allowed one or two players to be from abroad. 

You realize that virtually every soccer league on the planet has this exact same rule, right? For example, let's just look at the English Premier League, which is probably the most popular single sports league on earth. Every Premier League team *has* to have at least eight home-grown players (players who came up in England through the English football system) to ensure that England continues to produce talented players and isn't totally overrun with foreign talent. 

Other leagues don't have this rule, but that's because it isn't a problem. The NHL, for example, [is and has always been](http://www.quanthockey.com/TS/TS_PlayerNationalities.php) like 80% or more people from NA. Or take the MLB, where [about 70%+  of the players are American](http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/7779279/percentage-foreign-major-league-baseball-players-rises). Those are both *higher* percentages of NA players than what Riot's rule requires. 

&gt;What happened with Rush, Impact, and Piglet is they were brought into a system not to win but to look good on paper.

First of all, you have absolutely no evidence for this statement. Also, it makes no sense. Why? What benefit does ""looking good on paper"" bring to anyone? It's not like these teams are selling tickets to their games, and the name ""Piglet"" puts butts in seats. Having a team that ""looks good on paper"" under the current LCS system is pretty pointless. Performance is what brings in the highest-paying sponsorships, and what keeps fans following your team. Getting a name like Piglet is attention-grabbing, but not in any way that's profitable for a team owner unless he *also* can perform well. 

&gt;EU handled their Imported players far better, and I didn't watch many of the VODs. Far less snide comments from fans and casters alike.

You're confusing snide and critical here. NA casters (and fans) were critical of Piglet because he performed poorly. EU fans and casters weren't critical about Huni and Reignover because they were stomping other teams off the face of the goddamn earth. (There was plenty of criticism for Ryu when he got off to kind of a rough start, though. And there was a LOT of rage when the new Fnatic roster was first announced. Nobody liked it until they saw Huni start beasting people.)

It's all about performance. Players who are performing well will get a free pass even when they make mistakes, players who are performing poorly will get criticized. It's part of the territory, and it happens to players of all nationalities. 

Now, MAYBE you could make an argument about how TL's team structure wasn't set up to best support Piglet and Fenix or something. But you haven't made that argument. Nor do you really have any knowledge about how their system works, unless you work for TL. ",cunek9w,False

In more industrialized nations, we consider 500 and 600 cc bikes ""starter"" bikes. We also consider bikes a luxury or hobbiest item. In lower income or undeveloped nations, they are regularly smaller, and considered entry level modes of every day transportation.

India likes very light, small engined bikes for scooting about incredibly busy cities. These are usually replicas of a company's full sized bikes of the particular styling with 50, 125, and 250 cc engines. If you're traveling on highways or over rough terrain, you do not want to be on a 125 cc bike like that. 

I have owned a 250 sport bike, and once they hit 70 on an interstate, you lose a lot of the fast acceleration you enjoy at lower speeds that can get you out of trouble, especially if you're carrying saddle bags and a tail bag. I'd never take the average 125 (the is a 125 racing class, but the bikes in question are just city bikes) on a highway. The Honda Grom is a very common 125, and many users have issues keeping up with traffic on 55 MPH roads.

This rider is probably going somewhere they'll need reliable transportation, and while they can't ride all the way there, they can easily ride in the city or down small rural roads at their destination.

&gt;Now the crisis of the West is ongoing, and everybody knows what it is. In the circumstances of the United States—I’ve only ever been here twice—the prognosis for decay is well-advanced. The people who created the United States are on the defensive: they’re on the defensive psychologically, and emotionally, and linguistically, and culturally. People are comfortable, at least those that are, and a lot hit by recession, but everyone is worried about what the future will hold. Demographically, the people in this room could well be a minority in 40 years, maybe less than 40 years, maybe more than 40 years; maybe it doesn’t matter if it’s 40 years or 44 or 64 or 35.

&gt;What matters is that you’ve become a minority now. You’ve become a minority mentally, because these things happen to people mentally and psycho-spiritually before they have a physical impact. I think people are preparing to be a minority now, long before it happens. I was well aware that President Bill Clinton was once asked about his commitment to political correctness, and he said whites need political correctness. He said white Europeans, white Americans need it because they’re going to be a minority relatively soon, and you need to play all of those vanguard games whereby you play off each group against every other group, you make sure that your protest is in early whenever you’re insulted, or you feel there’s the prospect that you might be insulted

So many good quotes from this talk. 

&gt;If people think that the circumstances of American life are ill-disposed to your future identity now, what’s it going to be like in 50 years? What’s it going to be like in 150 years? In 150 years white Americans could be maybe 20% of the population. This is the future that faces you. And your culture will be disprivileged. Forget political correctness. Political correctness works when minorities aggregate together in a vanguard way. It doesn’t work when majorities fall and stagger into minority status and then look around for allies now that they are themselves a minority in the hope that somehow they will achieve fairness and equity. Because these things are not about fairness and equity. They are about who can set the standard and the tone for the cultural domination of a civic space. And if it’s not the white identity in the United States—if it’s not post-Europeanism in the USA—it will be other forms of identity. Some of them fractured, broken-down, mixed, and otherwise marginal.


More good stuff. 
  
&gt;Political correctness is a methodology and a grammar. It is designed to restrict the prospect of a thought before the thought is even enunciated. Chairman Mao had the idea of “magic words.” Magic words. “Racism” is a magic word. Use it, and people fall apart. People begin to disengage even from their own desire to defend themselves. All of the other “–isms”: sexism, disableism, classism, ageism, homophobia, Islamaphobia, all the others are pale reflections, in other and slightly less crucial areas, of the original one: “racism.”

&gt;“Racism” is a term developed by Leon Trotsky in an article in the Left oppositionist journal in the Soviet Union in 1926 or 1927. It is now universalized from its dissentient communist origins—don’t forget Trotsky was on the way out of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as Stalin engineered his disposal and the disposal the Left opposition that he led—and that word has been extracted now to such a degree that it is a universal. It’s universal, it’s become a moral lexicon of engagement and disengagement. If you wish to condemn somebody in contemporary discourse, you say that they are a racist. And there’s a degree to which nobody can refute what you’re saying in the present dispensation.",cung1w4,1441144964

Dar a los griegos un poco de libertad de acción para hacer inversiones públicas y reducir la carga de la deuda ayudaría a restaurar la economía griega y a sacar adelante el proyecto europeo contra el aumentado escepticismo del electorado europeo y una economía de la Eurozona que está en estancamiento y deflación. ¿Lo veis? La austeridad no funciona. Así va el argumento.”

“Pero, los alemanes no son ‘irracionales’ desde el punto de vista del capital. Los partidarios de la austeridad estiman que el capitalismo europeo no se puede recuperar, a menos que el sector capitalista recupere su rentabilidad y se reduzca la carga de la deuda. Esto significa reformas neoliberales ‘estructurales’, básicamente, diezmar el poder laboral a través de leyes antisindicales, aumento de los derechos a despedir, recorte de las prestaciones de desempleo y de las pensiones, y más privatizaciones. Junto a esto, se deben hacer recortes en los gastos públicos y en la deuda para que se permitan recortes en la fiscalidad de las grandes empresas y así aumente la rentabilidad. Reducir los costes laborales, estimular la rentabilidad —esta es la salida de esta depresión. Esta es una estrategia racional por parte del capital.”   (  Michael Roberts ).

On Monday 20000 people demonstrated for human conditions and help for the refugees (refugees welcome) and against rightwing fear mongering. The police that accompanied the demonstration carried their riot gear helmets in their hands instead of equipping them( probably to distance themselves from recent racist accusations against the police).  Several hundred people went to Westbahnhof, where a few thousand refugees from Budapest arrived that day. The helpers completely bought out near supermarkets to provide the refugees with water, food, diapers, etc...  
  
Most of this was caused by the discovery of the 71 suffocated refugees in a truck. Since then the police spends a lot of time finding and arresting human traffickers. Of course there are a lot of xenophobic remarks and some serious concerns but official course by the government is to register everyone they can and accept all refugees from Syria. 
   
Long term they want possibilities to apply for refugees from outside of Europe, a fair distribution of refugees in the EU and a solution for the conflict I'm syria, even a military one ( which surprisingly was even proposed as a last resort by several NGOs).  
  
Overall it does currently divide the country and since there are elections in Vienna in October  a lot of populist and fascist propaganda is made.

O governo está fazendo pressão da única maneira que os congressistas entendem, com a arma nuclear da realidade e do problema exposto. O governo, claro, tem suas preferências e vai atuar nos bastidores para faze-las valer. Eu acho vergonhoso, até coloquei no reddit, mas eu faço a pergunta que fiz em outro tópico: como responder a demanda social, a demanda econômica, a fiscal, o funcionamento da própria máquina? Dizer gestão, cortes, aumentar tributos, nenhuma resposta parece ser a solução única e mágica. Provavelmente a solução vai ser mista.

Você pergunta por horizonte. O plano não teve nenhum símbolo, palavras bonitas, um mantra claro. Mas parece claro que o plano Levy-Barbosa-Tombini passa, ao menos no curto prazo, pela recuperação da balança de pagamentos via exportação.  As mesmas exportações que deveriam servir como amortecedor do problema econômico. Por fatores internos e externos de ordem tanto política quanto econômica a velocidade de crescimento das exportações e do desenvolvimento deste próprio plano não tem sido a contento. Apesar disso está havendo uma melhora neste tópico, sendo que ano passado era um problema crônico.

Isso não quer dizer que acredite, confie, ou esteja otimista ou pessimista. Isso é a realidade.

if austin announced in may, i want to fight to get qpr into the prem again, great. or if he decided i want to help qpr by being sold to the highest bidder thats equally respectable.

but he hasn't, hes tried to get a move to a club of his choosing, which obviously hasnt worked. in doing so, he hasn't helped us, any of his other suitors or really qpr.

imagine a qpr fan now, knowing he's only there because something better didnt come along, so he is collecting a cheque until next summers big pay day.

what about the pride of playing for england in a season with the euros at the end? palace could haveprovided that platform? play well, get a better move in 12 months, everybody wins...qpr get sell on, palace get a higher fee for providing a better shop window.

i dont mind us being used as a platform, we know we arent a big top four club,but we are a decent mid table prem club, who lest anyone forgets beat city last season as they were trying to catch chelsea....and we've just beat chelsea trying to catch city.

qpr are a dogs cunt of a club, their fans are loyal and long suffering like us but their management is woeful, their facilities make ours look like the bernabeu and again if ffp comes back, they face huge penalties.

austin left burnley at their peak to join qpr, when the smarter money was on burnley. his partner Ings from Burnley is now at liverpool,while austin has chosen another 12 months at qpr so he can have a bigger pay off next summer. he's thrown away his chance of being at the euros, which Ings now has.

if hes this kind of guy consistently, then we are better of without him, it just gets under my skin that these people are the kind of people we have to deal with.

you're right he is under no obligation to join palace, but as a millionaire with a talent he should feel some kind of obligation to himself, to have some kind of ambition and to the fans, both qpr, palace and england. palaces offer would have probably put him on cabaye and dann kind of money, with a shot at europe if the team gels and we ride our luck and at worst he can be selfish in front of goal and get some goal bonuses and try for the england squad, all done in front of the best fans in the country. our stadium is not that bad, our training ground is not that bad, our manager is not that bad.....the only reason for not coming here, in the face of no better offers, is greed.

She trains European-line working dogs for personal protection and explained to me that big floppy ears and tails are dangerous for a dog if it ever gets into a real fight -- and for protection animals, that is a genuine concern. The floppy bits -- ears and tails -- can easily be grabbed/ripped/etc, causing a lot of problems and pain, and having them docked was for the dog's wellbeing in that event. Done properly as a puppy, I was told, minimizes the trauma and they grow up pretty normally. 

I personally don't feel comfortable with it, and would never do it to a dog, but I kind of understand the logic here, and I've seen people bankrupt themselves for the health and happiness of their dogs -- dogs they had cropped as puppies -- so at least in those instances, they truly believe they're doing it for the animal's wellbeing, and they love the dogs.

But I'm also sure that some people have their animals cropped for nothing more than the look of it, or just because it's standard practice, and/or don't give a crap about the animal's wellbeing.

You'll find - as mentioned in the review of same studies - that those that conclude that the EU has a negative fiscal impact fail to account for benefits such as foreign direct investment and higher trade flows (ie. the very benefits I mentioned earlier)by way of example. Instead they take a relatively narrow static approach to same. More thorough reviews, that account for FDI by way of example, find that the EU has a net benefit.

&gt;I'm not sure why you think that the UK Supreme Court would not be able to hold the UK government to its legal obligations. 

Given the significant body of law that has seen the ECtHR effectively overturn UKSC cases, that would seem to be exactly the case. 

&gt;As for departing from precedence from the ECHR, that is entirely appropriate.

Not particularly. The entire reason for an international treaty protecting human rights is that it operates at a supranational basis, as human rights should exist beyond the interpretation of Courts of member states. Otherwise UK Courts could - and have attempted to - simply take a harmonious approach to applying the treaty (Hirst, by way of example). This effectively results in some people being entitled to fundamental human rights and others not, based solely on a border. 

&gt;Ultimately the people that enact legislation should be elected politicians, not unelected judges. 

Not talking about legislation at all. Talking about precedent. If you'd rather elected officials handle all jurisprudence, look at the US and the failures of directly elected judges there.

A core element of her conclusions can be seen in the following excerpt from one of her books:
*In the first place, it is unlikely that so brief a period of commercial the nineteenth century, for example, the town of Ha'il enjoyed a meteoric rise to commercial importance, comparable to that described for Mecca, without there being any indication of a correspondingly swift breakdown of traditional norms. Why should there have been? It takes considerably more than a century of commercial success to undermine the tribal order of a population that has been neither uprooted nor forced to adopt a different organization in connection with its economic activi- ties. Caravan trade is not capitalist in any real sense of that word, and Watt's vision of the Meccans as financiers dedicated to a ruthless pursuit of profit occasionaly suggests that he envisages them as having made a transition to the twentieth century .* (The Rise of Islam p.231)

Crone's thesis that tribal order change ""...takes considerably more than a century..."" misses the undeniable fact that many orders can be transformed in much shorter time e.g. Cuba 1959, Byzantium under Heraclius, China's revolution under Mao, etc.

So Holland wanting this fragment to be older simply serves his own bias and Orientalist/neocolonialist thinking.

It is also worth noting that both Crone and Holland sought European references for the early stages of Islam and dismissed early Islamic historians in the theory that those Islamic historians would not have the intellectual honesty or rigor to present accurate records.

It is highly illogical to assume that just because someone is read in some history that said person is without bias.

Note that the hotel lobby at 0:10 was one of the confirmed locations of a sniper

&gt; The departure of the police had been days in the making, a result of a sequence of events that began late on Wednesday with the seizing of an Interior Ministry armory in the western city of Lviv and the transportation of those weapons to the outskirts of Kiev, the capital. Violent clashes on Thursday, which left more than 80 protesters and many police officers dead, enraged the opposition and sapped the will of Mr. Yanukovych’s enforcers, if not Mr. Yanukovych himself.

Source: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/world/europe/as-his-fortunes-fell-in-ukraine-a-president-clung-to-illusions.html?_r=1

&gt; The snipers started shooting before the armory was broken into.

I am not making a claim that the snipers got their weapons from the Lviv armory, I am just trying to see if we can agree on the order of events. Also, snipers started shooting on Thursday, armory was looted on Wednesday. Could you elaborate?

Separatists suggests that they wanted the region to separate from Ukraine and join Russia. Some were locals and some were Russian nationalists.

It attacked the Ukrainian army which led to a ceasefire being signed within weeks.

Here in the States we let horrible people say whatever they want under the protection of the law, and as a result there are very few racist tactics that we haven't heard a million times, and so liberal American redditors are quick to call out European racists.

Europeans are different. Their speech is a lot more restricted, and nationalism is much stronger and more mainstream, so I think for them what sounds only mildly nationalistic is to Americans rather racist rhetoric. So a general paranoia about the brown people flooding into their country makes French people, for example, very nervous for their ""culture,"" or their ""way of life,"" or their ""values,"" etc., and that seems completely reasonable.

That's the fault of whatever culture or institution is there when they get there. There's no such thing as a group of people who ""won't assimilate."" Humans are assimilating animals. Europe is in a much better position to do it right, so it's extra sad to see such an embarrassing fuckup over so relatively few refugees. 

Plus, I call bullshit on the factual truth of that statement. It's a common political statement that immigrants ""don't work,"" and it's not true here, even though it's all over the media. It's probably not true where you are, either. People want, generally, to feel productive. If you're suggesting that an entire population of humans has suddenly thrown off millions of years of evolutionary psychology and broken away from the biological realities of literally every other human on Earth, and suddenly become a total leeching douchebag? I'm going to be a bit incredulous. 

I've seen the news reports of the migrants in France who've spent their days painting, doing artwork, improving the camp facilities -- because they have no other work to do. Give people free time, and unless they're all on drugs, they'll get productive. 

You may not respect the work they do, or recognize it as valid (what if it's ""build a mosque,"" or ""steal food for my neighbor's kid?"" Still labor!) and if you're not careful, it'll be work against you instead of alongside or for you, but people want to be busy. 

So back to the migrant crisis: What the hell is the holdup? Hungary can put these people on the trains YESTERDAY and the crisis vanishes. Germany has already said they'll resettle them. So why not let it happen? They're just punishing them for existing, and being not-Hungarian. That's all this shit really is. 

&gt; I don't care about your story about how your country is ""so great that it did immigrarion right, and you yuropoors can't even get it right"". It's an entirely different situation.

It's not that we're so great. We fucked it up SO BADLY that now Mexico is run by a violent mafia. That's our fault. They made all their money people-smuggling, with the USA as a destination. So we basically financed the rise of a murderous criminal cartel. We're paying for that now. We could have opened the borders, charged $25 for a visa, and bankrupted the cartels. Instead, those same cartels have more money than God, and are now extending their criminal networks into the territorial US. That's a pretty big fuckup, and all because white Amurrricans didn't want to ""let"" honest, hardworking ""illegals"" (read: normal people who we refused to issue papers to) into the country. 

Closing borders never, ever helps.

&gt;There's an important difference between descriptive and normative statements. Descriptive statements can attempt to explain behaviors or phenomena without being judgmental--ie, typically, women are traditionally seen as the ""gatekeepers"" of sex, while men are expected to take the more active role of convincing women they are worthwhile sexual partners. This does set up a certain dynamic.

Right. I'm just trying to figure out if it even works on a descriptive level. So I guess for now it's really just ""men are the key, women are the lock,"" without the rest of the metaphor.
