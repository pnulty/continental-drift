Superbeastreality,,,"&gt; Of course you're not offended, that's the point. I wonder why....

Well then don't make an objective statement about a subjective matter.



&gt;Cultural appropriation is only ""cultural appropriation"" when it's the dominant culture doing the appropriating. You can't really ""appropriate"" a dominat culture forced on you... but hey.. according to your logic..



The hypothetical group of people who you suggest as possibly using a quasi-european system would not have had it forced on them. Wasn't that your point?




&gt;Of course it wouldn't make you uncomfortable because you regard it as fantasy and not something rooted in any minute sense of possibility. 


Actually, my people were subjucated for about 800 years, it's arguably still ongoing. Bit rude to make such assumptions. But, I'll leave it at that because I'm not the type to get upset about the past. 

Anyway, your statement

&gt;Of course it wouldn't make you uncomfortable because you regard it as fantasy and not something rooted in any minute sense of possibility. 


seems to contradict your earlier statement




&gt;If it were meant to ""teach a lesson"", why not role reverse? What would happen if it were white slaves instead of black? What if indigenous had repelled invasions or adopted a quasi-european system (for scenic relatability within the program i.e. High Castle style)? I bet that would feel a bit uncomfortable, no?


Funny, that. 




&gt;Your privilege is safe and sound. 



What privilege is that? 




&gt;Hell, your demographic gets up in arms over comic book characters swapping races/genders. Stop it lol. 



That's a generalisation, isn't it? It's a bit at odds with your next statement....





&gt;Africa is an entire continent.. arguably the largest. Therefore, it's illogical to band an entire continent under one specific social / culture structure.



Of course it's okay to group all white people together, but not Africans. You're a hypocrite. 



&gt;Nations sold prisoners to other (non African) for capital or political influence, etc. Obviously not knowing this would lead to industrialized slavery based on little but the genetic makeup of slaves and their family in perpetuity. You're an idiot for this attempted retort. Seriously.



You're saying that they sold their fellow Africans without realising that those Africans would be treated as slaves? That's weird. Are you saying that Africans lack foresight? It's a strange argument you're presenting. How do you believe that they didn't think that creating a slave industry would lead to indutrialised slavery? 




&gt;Look up ""house slaves"" in reference to ""field slaves"" or refer to Django. That answers your ""but there's black people involved"" statement. 



I didn't make a ""but there's black people involved"" statement, I asked you a question. A question and a statement aren't the same thing. Did you ever go to school? 

And what is your point here? That any black person that writes a story about an alternate history where black people are still enslaved in the US is a race traitor, or brainwashed....? What is it?




&gt;Also, generalizing a race's reaction based on a few individuals is inherently racist.




I don't remeber generalising a race's reaction. I do remember you saying


&gt;Hell, your demographic gets up in arms over comic book characters swapping races/genders. Stop it lol. 


You're a hypocrite and a liar. 






&gt;You need to socialize more often. Maybe you'll change your myopic mindstate by default. Now, suck you mum.


I'm fairly social. Maybe you should get outside your echo chamber and learn to deal with people who have different opinions to yours in a mature way, rather than throwing out childish insults, making things up, making racist generalisations, and playing the perpetual victim. 


It'd be really nice if you could go on with your life without such a chip on your shoulder. It's not good for your heart. This whole ""us versus them"" attitude won't get you anywhere. Good luck with your life.

JBSwiftus,GFR,GFR | Moderator,"1 - I don't know your experience with the electrical systems of some top-tier teams in Europe, but I would bet those teams have a higher quality and safety standard implemented within their own structure than what is enforced by FH or FS. When it comes to electrical work, high standards equals high reliability - which inevitably becomes the primary goal of a team that already knows how to make a car fast.

2 - On finishing rates - I think it is important to keep the competition difficult enough that not everyone finishes. While it is a hard lesson, failure is still an important part towards learning how to succeed. With that said, if a competition ever has less than a 33% endurance completion rate in FS it feels like an awful competition. The general moral of the entire field will be low and many may choose not to participate the next year. A good finishing rate seems to be nearer to the 50% mark. At that point you will have some teams that are heartbroken, but enough of the 'underdogs' finished to give everyone who didn't hope for the next year. 

2b - On Regen - The slope idea is novel but also a little out of place in a racing competition in my mind. In racing, you regen when braking to save that energy for corner exit. No need for slopes. The motivation is inherent to the task of going faster.

Maybe one approach towards encouraging regen without the slope obstacle would be to simply limit the amount of energy a car can start with. Charge the batteries (and count the Joules input) and fill the gas tank with a limited amount of fuel. Teams then get to decide how much regen they will be doing and how much fuel they want to use. Ideally they come up with a strategy that uses the least amount of energy overall while still maintaining fast lap times.

But, atm, the way we are heading is NOT popular. We have 5 ministers with 2.5% voter support, due to populist party breaking up to racist (True Finns) and snakes (Blue Choice.. yea..sketchy as fuck..). THe breaking happened due to their support vaning because they couldn't enact any of their immigration stuff, because they were against EU human rights AND Finnish constitution. Government will lose the next election due to them failing in record number of proposals due to sheer ignorance about constitution and rules in politics in general.. oh, we have CEO as PM.. go figure... I have not seen this kind of thing before, i mean, they have fumbled before but not like that. It seems that all three key things they promised to take care off, none will go thru as they are either: breaking EU human rights, breaking Finnish constitution, are increasingly unpopular and simply impossible to do in the timeframe they want it to happen.

It is about privatization of healthcare. Bringing private market to compete with public but not in a way that may not allow public to stay as primary healthcare. We don't know, nothing has been researched, research is tossed away if it doesn't agree, equality is threatened. Right wing and populist are just sheer assholes and we are now having resurgence of green and left.. Go figure.. :) Healthcare seems to be stuck and if they can't pass it on a deadline, will be delayed after the newly organized local elections: more power to the big cities, less services for remotes and rural, this also affects healthcare, that is going to be larger areas for single providers.. whoopdidoo, like it was designed for large international health providers..

snailslimeandbeespit,,Low Buy,"Oh gosh, I don't know if China has more scams than other countries – I've heard of lots of scamming and pickpocketing in Europe as well. I imagine scams happen everywhere, and who is scammed where depends on lots of factors. I'm a Caucasian female, so there are certain places where I'm likelier to stand out as an ""outsider,"" plus I think people might assume that women are easier targets. Moreover, I just have lots of personal experience with being scammed in China because I've lived there and traveled there a lot, including traveling alone, whereas I've never been to continental Europe, Latin America (beyond Mexico, Puerto Rico, and some Caribbean islands), the Middle East, or Africa. 

If I had to guess, and this is pure conjecture, I think the stark income inequality in China is a huge factor. As for Hong Kong and Taiwan being different (though they still have pickpocketing), maybe they're not that different but it's just that I've been lucky? I actually think that HK does have scams, but they're probably scams targeting mainland visitors (there's a strong anti-mainland sentiment in HK right now). Oh, of course there are suit makers and watch sellers in Tsim Sha Tsui who target foreign tourists, but I think these are different kinds of scams, more like you might be ripped off and pay too much for a fake Rolex, and I always ignore those pushy sellers (plus, I don't spend that much time in TST). Also, as far as I know, in present-day HK you don't have a different pricing system based on a person's race or nationality, so there's no need for someone to help you get a cheaper ""local price"" ticket for things like what happened to me with the guy who bought my boat ticket. As for Taiwan, I would say that even though it has some problems with unemployment, overall it's a relatively more stable society than the mainland. It was ranked the #1 place in the world to live recently, and I imagine that when people are able to make a decent living, they are less inclined to resort to scamming people to make money. I also think HK and Taiwan have a lot more regulations about certain things, and I imagine that scammers hanging around places like the airport would not be tolerated (but I could be wrong). However, honestly, I really don't know, and again, I'm just basing things on my personal experience. I'm hesitant to make assumptions based on other factors. 

I don't think this should discourage you from visiting China or anywhere else. Wherever you go,  you just need to be careful. I have a friend who was robbed by a child in the Louvre. Another friends' parents were pick pocketed in Italy – her parents live in China and have never been pick pocketed there. I could also tell you lots of stories where strangers have been very kind to me in China. For example, once my friend and I were on a long-haul train during Chinese New Year, and we met an older couple who wanted us to go to their home for dinner before we went on to Hong Kong (they lived in Guangzhou, near HK) as they didn't want us to be alone on a holiday. (It would be akin to a stranger inviting someone to spend Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner with someone here.) And I have many other positive stories like this too. 

I think ultimately you can get scammed just about anywhere, but if you're careful you'll be fine. I suspect that scams are likelier to happen in touristy areas, so just have your guard up when you're in those places. It also occurs to me as I'm writing this that during my past few HK trips I haven't really been in any touristy areas, so that might play a factor, and most of the touristy places I've gone to in Taiwan have been with Taiwanese friends. Keep in mind that all the China tales I told you in my the post happened when I was traveling alone. Anyway, there are lots of lovely places to visit in China, and it's probably more interesting than HK from a tourist perspective.

Tsuihousha,,,"When you're looking at when you should betray an ally? When it is advantageous to do so. If you can easily get another ally; or you can grab another subject easily do so!

For example in my current game (it was about 1565) I beat the piss out of Hungary and forced them to release Translyvania; who would accept a diplo vassalization if I sold them one province in Slovakia (due to it being one of their cores) so I did so. After that I declared my Excommunication war on a 8 province Mantua and Austria (my ally) honoured their CTA. Austria's outlived their usefulness and I have no intentions of keeping in kind with them from this point forward so I am going to separate peace them and cripple their nation by dividing them into chunks.


As for late game specifically? Max out your absolutism as quickly as you can; don't worry about having high autonomy everywhere you want to be able to pound down that plunger for the Absolutism when you get into the third age on as many provinces as you can.

If you can save up military points do it; you can dump these into rebellions or to increase legitimacy to bump your Absolutism as well.

Once you get to your current cap (or near it) trigger the disaster; if you have to lower your stability by doing things you never would. If you're prepared for it you can trigger the disaster and have it resolved within the first 30-40 years of having Absolutism activated.

That increase is *huge*. If you're blobbing you want Administrative ideas as one of your first four groups more likely than not; even without the CCR -1.00 interest per annum and +5 states are both *huge* bonuses now that states are so insanely limited.

Don't worry about stating bad stuff either; if it isn't 35+ development you probably don't want to worry about it. 

If you're worried about becoming behind time or filling out an idea group don't state core *anything*; put it off. \


If you max out your Absolutism you should be able to conquer most of France in 2-3 wars. (Depends how large they've gotten) generally you want to try to cut the legs out of your primary competitors early in the game, even more so if they are a colonizer, crippling Iberia, France and England will give you a monopoly on new world regions and trade companies which you can use to crush Europe beneath the heel of your boot even further.

Here's an example of my current game in 1575 where I left off last time I was playing; I'm Sardinia-Piedmont; Mazovia, Catolonia, Translyvania and Lithuania are vassals. France I have a union over. I'm currently allied with Russia, Colonge, Bohemia and Saxony. I'm at war with Mantua &amp; Austria, Krakow, and Holland. (3 wars) and I have truces with every major nation nearby except for the Muslims. 

Don't be afraid to go over your diplo limit if you get a huge power boost out of it. (HRE Emperorship is pretty big one) 

When I get to Absolutism I'm going to pool Military points and get it up quickly and absorb land in India, Africa and the Middle East exceedingly quickly.

ripyourbloodyarmsoff,,,"&gt; Australia's separation from Britain was was slow, reluctant and painful. London disappointed, even betrayed, Australia, repeatedly, yet we clung to mother's skirts. Mother forced Australia to independence in three big shocks. First was World War Two. Australia, under threat of Japanese invasion, put its full trust in Britain and its invincible Far East fortress, Singapore. But the invincible was vanquished in just a week as a result of British military stupidity.

&gt; This was the moment that snapped Australian prime minister John Curtin out of the national delusion that Britain would protect Australia. He asked Winston Churchill to release Australian troops so that they could return to defend their country. Churchill refused. Curtin ultimately overruled him.

&gt; Second was the Suez crisis of 1956. This revealed Britain to be a second-rate power, politically, militarily, economically. This ultimately forced Britain to withdraw all its military forces from Asia. But, again, Canberra resisted reality, hoping against hope that Britain would keep the peace in South East Asia. There was still a substantial UK force in Singapore, including two aircraft carriers. When Britain formally announced in 1967 the withdrawal of its last forces from Malaysia and Singapore, Australia's Harold Holt was angry and bitter: ""We must rethink our whole situation.""

&gt; Third was Britain's decision to sever its special commercial ties with Australia. London first decided to join the European Economic Community's common market, later the European Union, in 1961, though it wasn't formally a member till 1973. ""It wasn't just the economic and defence structures of the past that were being dismantled,"" Gyngell writes. London imposed new restrictions on Aussie immigration.

&gt; Temos conhecidos, em determinada província(Halifax), que já foram pra lá (não sei se isso ajuda durante o processo).

sim e nao. eles podem te ajudar com moradia, mas em relação ao processo, eles teriam que se envolver e tipo meio que escrever uma carta te convidando para o país. e com isso eles ficariam responsabilizados por tudo.



&gt; Coisa que eu sei do processo (mas me corrijam se estiverem erradas): * Existe o processo de imigração provincial e um federal. * É necessário um certificação do idioma inglês ou francês (TOEFL, IELTS, ETC). * Documentações de formação e algumas outras precisam ter tradução juramentada. * É necessário apresentar uma conta com um determinado valor provando que você tem condições de se sustentar.

O processo provincial, mais rápido e o federal, mais demorado. vc precisa do IELTS General, não lembro da pontuação. nao sei se realmente vc não precisa de tradução juramentada, pois para tentar faculdade, algumas aceitam tradução simples mesmo. vc precisa provar q tem 10k em cad, seja poupança, investimento, dinheiro na conta corrente. 


&gt; * Qual é o melhor modo de eu ir? tentando um bolsa de doutorado? juntando mais grana e ir com um visto pra estudante(pagando um curso lá, como um colega meu fez) com extensão pra minha esposa? 

estudando. porém é o mais longo e mais caro. enquanto vc estuda sua mulher pode trabalhar.
a trajetória é longa: estuda no canada com um visto de estudante em uma escola publica -&gt; consegue visto de trabalho após formar (PGWP) -&gt; com 1 ano de experiencia de trabalho vc aplica para o EE (express entry) isso te faz ter mais pontos -&gt; vc é convidado a aplicar para o PR -&gt; depois de 3 anos morando direto no canada vc pode aplicar para cidadania  


&gt; * Existe mesmo um processo no qual eu possa ser chamado através de um pool, onde nós ficamos e o governos canadense chama pra preencher determinadas vagas? (Seria o Express Entry? foi o que me falaram) * Havendo a chance, quanto dura o processo burocrático para se imigrar? 6 meses? 1 ano?

sim, a cada mês eles chamam pessoas que tem mais de [400 pontos](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/express-entry/rounds.asp). nao sei a duração, mas nao acho que deva passar de 6 meses. 


outras coisas a ser mencionado:
- Caso opte por estudar , vc vai como estudante e sua mulher pode trabalhar.
- procure fazer uma pós, e por faculdades que deem bolsa. pós graduação ganha mais pontos no processo de imigração


espero ter ajudado.

Calfurious,,,"Of course the Southern Strategy on the surface is overly simplified. That being said, there are literal accounts from GOP politicians that have basically said that the strategy was to use dog whistling tactics to pander to racist sentiments. [As show in this infamous quote by campaign consultant Lee Atwater in 1981.](https://www.thenation.com/article/exclusive-lee-atwaters-infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/)

&gt; You start out in 1954 by saying, “Nigger, nigger, nigger.” By 1968 you can’t say “nigger”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “Nigger, nigger.”


I'm going to have to disagree. I've always thought the Republican Party's racial appeal was more visible than Democrats. Of course I'm liberal (and grew up in a Black household) so of course it's only my own biased perspective. 

I've never really understood why Democrats are called the party of identity politics. Most Black people vote for Democrats simply because the GOP, on a variety of different levels, have made an image of them being unwelcoming to African-Americans or, at best, too cozy with racists. Shit, a lot of Black people have social/cultural views that often align with traditional GOP politicians, but the image of the party is that of it being a ""White party"", not an inclusive one. Democrats are simply the default choice after that.

I mean yes, you say things like Affirmative Action and welfare, etc, etc,. But I hardly hear any of the politicians have any meaningful conversations about those topics. At best it's just lip service, a speech here or there, but nothing of any real substance.

Reagen used dog whistle tactics when he referred to ""welfare queens"". Mitt Romney used dog whistle tactics when he said he'd get along better with European countries because of a shared ""Anglo-Saxon heritage"". Right-Wing media often time uses example of Black people being violent (or perceived as being violent), by often labeling them ""thugs"". Shit even Bill O'Reilly, a powerful figure within the GOP and Fox News Network, has a history of making numerous racist statements, [including saying that a Black professor looked like a drug dealer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np4f5p8XCrg)

Maybe it's because I'm young (I'm 21), but I've never gotten the impression that Democrats made particularly active strides to appeal to Black voters through policies that favor them. In fact the only time I can remember a direct appeal to Black voters was during the Obama candidacy, and this is likely a one time thing due to the historical and cultural significance of a Black person being president.

To sum it up. I honestly cannot understand why one would think the Democrats are the identity politics party and not the GOP. For as long as I can recall, the GOP have been far more aggressive in racial and religious identity politics than Democrats have. Maybe it's because we consume different sources of media or grew up in different backgrounds. I don't know. But I know of very few Black voters that would say that the Democrats have acted in a way to favor us.

[Joseph Stalin and the Orthodox Christian Church of Russia](http://www.infidels.eu/violence#Joseph_Stalin_and_the_Orthodox_Christian_Church_of_Russia):  
&gt; It is usual thing for religious people and societies, to name Josef Stalin as an “atheist”, like they did this many times with Adolf Hitler. Of course, there is no doubt, that majority of Soviet leaders, including Vladimir Lenin, Nikita Khrushchev or Mikhail Gorbachev, were atheists and few of them even militant. However, the bloodiest communist regime dictator Josef Stalin (1878 – 1953) was not an ATHEIST, but RELIGIOUS COMMUNIST. There was period in his life (during and after humiliating and cruel regime in Tbilisi Priest‘s Seminary and revolution time, when Stalin fought against monarchical dictatorship, supported by church), when he hold grudge against priests and religion, struggled and leaned more towards atheism. But eventually he returned to his religious roots and chose to resurrect and protect religion in USSR. Stalin used blind faith-based religious principles to strengthen his own dictatorship.   
  
and  
&gt; Stalin grew in religious family and it was planned that he will become a priest. Therefore Stalin received religious education in Gori Church‘s School (1888-09-01 – 1894-06-??) and Tbilisi Priest‘s Seminary (1894-09-01 – 1899-07-29) which he didn’t accomplished, because he entered Revolution movement. Ideas about rich people as oppressors of the poor, how to defend poor people from them and that rich people will go to Hell or, at least, it will be hard for them to go to (communistic) heaven, Stalin collected from his religious education and the Bible.

3) PCIA must make audit of the condemned and arrested citizens on the affairs, connected with serving to God activity. To release from custody and to replace punishment with not connected with imprisonment for condemned on the specified motives, if activity of these citizens has not put harm to the Soviet authority.

Not sure on the title, but it would be a 1950s-60s era wargame, with the three fronts being based on campaign scenarios ranging from 


- Vietnam War alt-histories (Escalation in Vietnam with heavier Soviet involvement)
(Perhaps a honhonhon French campaign that actually lets French bias succeed in defending the airstrip at Dien Bien Phu)


- The ACTUAL Korean War; don't need to invent a second one


- A *likely* European Escalation (this would be the earliest-dated campaign where World War 2 continues into a Soviet-Western conflict; US fires only nuke on Moscow, soviet troops advance with fury)


Have the game be a Wargame taking place in an earlier time period instead of a later one, as many people suggest. Latest year would be 1970, maybe earlier... 


Now you might be saying ""oh it'll just be wargame with people on old units"" but Cat-C wargame doesn't have the full arsenal of men and arms and also infantry weapons that could be in a game dedicated to 1945-1970 units. 

Also Ranked would be Cat-C instead of just helorushers and Israel,Finland,Yugoslavia,HOnHONhoN-enthusiasts

For the people lucky enough to even get paid vacation, you typically start with between 40 and 80 hours worth (5-10 workdays) of vacation, which you get each year for the first few years. Importantly, unused vacation time is lost, so you can't save up multiple years' worth. Most companies then typically add 40 hours at certain milestones, like 5 or 10 years of employment. There's usually an upper limit of 4-5 weeks worth of vacation, alongside a policy which prevents you from taking more than 2-3 weeks in a row. 

I'm a software developer, and my pay, bonuses, and other benefits are outstanding, but the vacation policy is the same as anywhere else. My company gives you 2 weeks for the first 5 years, then 3 weeks until the 7th year, 4 weeks until the 9th year, then caps out at 5 weeks. You aren't allowed to take more than 2 weeks in a row off without getting specific authorization from senior management, which is rarely approved.

RSquared,,,"Consider that JUST the government-paid portion of US health care is of a similar cost per capita as most Euro-nations.  While it's possible that the US has sicker people, what's mostly happening is poor cost control.  The last two major health care bills - Medicare Part D and the ACA - had very very minor cost control measures and were mostly additional entitlements.  Medicare D was barred from negotiating drug prices, and instead gets the lowest available private price.  This is silly because Medicare eclipses all of those private entities in users, and could negotiate cheaper prices.  The ACA had some cost control measures, notably that 85% of insurance premiums MUST go to care, but largely left the market alone after regulating what must go in the policy - the minimum package/preexisting condition rules - and who must buy it - everyone.  The third leg of the stool, the premium subsidies, are rightly criticized for inflating premium costs because insurers know that their customers can pay base premium+subsidies...though this IS tempered by the 85% requirement!

The major problem is that things like MRIs are multiple thousands of dollars in the US and hundreds of dollars in Europe...due to oversupply.  Hospitals can always order more tests, use more equipment, etc, and their behavior is rewarded by the private insurance system.  Putting that under government regulation would be beneficial to the system.

No meu entender, talvez errado, um MAC address é um metadado. É um numero arbitrário que serve apenas ao estabelecimento de uma ligação. E uma vez que a maioria dos sistemas operativos, por defeito, utiliza o do hardware, serve frequentemente de identificador.

Para fazeres correlações implica teres identificadores. Por exemplo não consegues estabelecer a claridade média de um país pelo EXIF, se não lá tiver algo que te identifique o país. Esse seria um identificador coletivo, um MAC adress, pelas características do mesmo, serve de identificador individual.

Ce qui est dingue pour les BlitzWolf c'est qu'il sont à 7,99€ sur www.amazon.fr &amp; 15€ ailleurs. Or j'aimerais ne pas acheter sur Amazon mais sur un site qui accepte PayPal. Avez vous des idées de sites (j'ai cherché sur ebay &amp; Google Shopping) ?

Ou avez-vous testé d'autres cables USB C ? Merci !

Sinon, je cherche des Redditeurs pour échanger légalement un compte Amazon Prime (ça se partage à 3, je cherche ça car je ne rentabiliserai jamais les 50€/an) &amp; un compte Netflix (que je ne rentabiliserai pas non plus, je suis déçu par l'offre de documentaires) contre des comptes Spotify family que je peux partager voire des comptes Google Music. &amp; d'autres comptes.

Si vous avez d'autres idées de comptes que l'on peut partager... Merci !

voici ci-dessous des questions que j'ai posées sur le forum d'aide du Google Home &amp; sur le forum de FrAndroid à propos de la sortie de Google Home en France (dans 2 jours, le 3 août &amp; ça sera le premier assistant vocal en français, Amazon Alexa n'est pas encore en français &amp; Orange Djingo n'est pas encore sorti non plus).

Disclaimer : j'utilise Amazon Echo / Alexa depuis un peu plus de 6 mois &amp; c'est vraiment très utile pour gagner du temps par exemple pour :

* lancer la radio à la voix (je n'arrive à faire marcher que France inter ou Europe 1 ou RTL sur Amazon Echo, pas France info)

* allumer/éteindre ses lumières

* ajouter une alarme à une certaine heure ou dans quelques minutes

je n'utilise que très peu l'ajout de produits sur une liste de course ou l'ajout de tâches à une to-Do list (ça n'est dispo qu'aux USA sur Amazon Alexa mais ça sera dispo dans 2 jours sur Google Home)

Pour ceux qui disent que c'est un micro ouvert à la maison il existe un bouton pour couper le micro à la fois sur Amazon Echo &amp; sur Google Home ou en disant ""OK Google, Turn off the microphone."" sur Google Home (pas essayé de le faire à la voix sur Amazon Echo)

***

* Je me demandais quels services sont disponibles en France / Français pour le lancement de Google Home dans notre pays ?

Certains services annoncés par les médias français et [le post sur le blog officiel de Google](https://france.googleblog.com/2017/07/google-home-arrive-en-france.html)

Je suppose que Google Music sera disponible. Sinon il y aura

- Spotify

- Uber

- robots aspirateurs Neato Robotics

- radio Europe 1 radio

- radio RTL

- Radio France (Franceinfo, France Inter, France Bleu, France Culture, France Musique, Fip, Mouv ')

- lumières LIFX

- domotique Nest

- lumières Philips

- prises Wemo

Savez vous quels seront les autres services ?

***

Serons-nous en mesure d'effectuer des appels (gratuits ?) entre 2 Google Home (ça me serait très utile pour appeler un sénior dans ma famille qui a du mal à répondre au téléphone. Aux USA les Amazon Echo ont une option flippante qui permet de faire des appels entre 2 Amazon Echo sans avoir besoin que l'autre ne décroche) ou entre un Google Home et une ligne fixe ou une ligne mobile ?

***

* Les utilisateurs français pourront-ils lancer n'importe quelle chanson avec Spotify sur Google Home ou Google Music sera-t-il nécessaire ?

* Quelles seront les différences entre Google Home et Spotify sur Google Home ?

a priori d'après certains tutos on pourra lancer n'importe quelle chanson avec Google Music à la voix mais pas avec Spotify :-(

confirmez-vous ?

Quelques autres services compatibles Google Home :

https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2017/07/the-best-google-assistant-skills-to-use-with-your-google-home/

* Google Calendar

* Todoist

* AutoVoice

Wunderlist rachetée par Microsoft n'a pas l'air compatible avec ni avec Google Home ni avec IFTTT. Si vous voulez profiter de la sortie de Google Home pour utiliser ToDoist (qui est compatible Google Home) (c'est très pratique d'ajouter des tâches à l'oral) vous pouvez importer vos tâches Wunderlist vers ToDoist sur https://todoist.com/import/wunderlist/

Je cherche à pouvoir envoyer des SMS depuis un PC. La dernière Build insider Windows 10 a rajouté un bouton ""synchroniser son PC &amp; son Android"" dans les parametres de Windows mais ça ne fait qu'envoyer un SMS avec un lien vers l'appli Microsoft Apps qui liste les applis Microsoft (Swiftkey, Office mobile, Cortana...).

Pushbullet permet l'envoi de SMS depuis Google Chrome sur PC si le téléphone est connecté au même wifi mais je ne trouve pas ça pratique.

la personne avec qui je codais légèrement en HTML &amp; à qui je déléguais certaines tâches s'engage dans l'armée (chasseurs alpins)

* est-ce que vous avez des conseils à lui donner (s'acheter du matériel dans des surplus militaires ? obéir à son supérieur ?) ?

* je cherche donc un remplaçant à cet ami. Où le trouver ? Hopwork (site francophone) ? upwork (site anglophone, il y a des francophones dessus ?) ?

Je cherche quelqu'un de francophone &amp; situé sur le même fuseau horaire que la France. De préférence en France (idéalement en Auvergne Rhône Alpes) mais si les tarifs des assistants en Afrique francophone ou à Madagascar / Maurice sont très intéressants pourquoi pas, je n'ai jamais testé.

Outre du code HTML léger, une tâche que j'aimerais déléguer est l'ajout de vidéos Youtube à des playlists Youtube après avoir forwardé les vidéos par email (il faut une personne de confiance car je lui laisserai l'accès à un de mes comptes Gmail).

Que me conseillez-vous pour trouver un assistant ? Merci.

j'aimerais voir ""Moi, Daniel Blake"" avant un rendez-vous Pôle Emploi

j'ai cherché des comparateurs de prix d'offres VàD / VoD pour les films de moins de 3 ans qui ne sont donc pas en SVOD (Netflix / CanalPlay) mais [l'article de Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparateur_de_vid%C3%A9os_%C3%A0_la_demande) n'est pas à jour (MySkreen a été racheté par Première par exemple &amp; ""voirUnFilm.fr"" n'est pas un site Web sûr selon le navigateur Google Chrome).

à défaut de VoD / VàD quelques sites de torrents qui semblent remplacer t411

avez-vous tester bananatag ou des alternatives (www.mailtrack.io) pour connaître le pays des gens à qui vous envoyez des emails &amp; savoir s'ils les ont ouverts ?

Electric motor companies, car companies (BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Opel etc), and other big manufacturing companies all help teams by providing mock competitions and weekend events before the official competitions. The 'ZF Race Camp' is one which my team participates in every year.

There is almost always something to fix. I totally agree with that. Its just inevitable. But having team experience running through technical inspections plus clear guidelines on what will and will not pass tech plus the use of the competition's own technical inspection sheets can all be stop-gaps in understanding and assuring the car will pass technical inspection. Our electrical team had been plagued with tech inspection follies a few years ago so for the past couple of years it has been one of the most emphasized things in the team - pass tech inspection on the first try. I would bet there are more than 100 man-hours of inspection run on the car before it ever leaves for a competition.

The key is did you all document everything that wasn't perfect and relay that information to the next year's team? After 5 or 6 years, eventually you have a list which is 500+ line-items long of individual checks and issues to ensure are all A-OK. Its all a learning process and there are no guarantees, but I'll happily admit to rebuilding a wiring harness 3 times before getting every length, bend radius, crimp, etc. right. It sucks because it is time consuming and wasteful, but spending a couple of extra hours in January to reduce the chances of being stopped in tech is almost always worth it.

You don't need forts or troops in Europe since your only Euro neighbour is a historical buddy. Just make sure to not piss Castile off.

AUSTIN, Texas, July 31, 2017 — Portalarium®, an Austin, Texas based game developer, and Travian Games, a Munich, Germany based publisher and developer, are pleased to announce today a formal partnership to bring Shroud of the Avatar™, the much-anticipated fantasy role-playing game from legendary game designer Richard “Lord British” Garriott to Europe, South America, Central America, the Middle East and North Africa. Travian Games will be coming on board as a partner immediately as Shroud is moving closer to the game’s commercial launch later this year.“We were looking for the best upcoming MMORPGs in our industry as well as a strong cultural fit, so we are truly excited about the opportunity to work with Richard and the Shroud of the Avatar team on bringing another great game to our community,” notes Lars Janssen, CEO of Travian Games. “Portalarium’s vision is very similar to ours and we believe this is the start of a long-term relationship between our two teams.”“Europe has always been a strong market for the Ultima games so we wanted to be sure we found the very best partner who could who truly understands what we wanted to accomplish with Shroud,” explains Richard Garriott.“Travian Games is that partner because they really understand community and development which has allowed them to build a huge base of millions of players.”To date, backers of Shroud have logged more than three-million hours of game testing, and the latest update, Release 44, now permits backers to complete the entire Episode 1 story, from beginning to end.Shroud of the Avatar, the spiritual successor to Garriott’s Ultima series of fantasy role-playing games, is a “selectively multiplayer” game, and includes a deep story crafted by Garriott and New York Times bestselling author, Tracy Hickman ( Dragonlance series). The game combines a detailed sandbox style Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) with a single player narrative mode. With Release 44, players can now complete the paths of Truth, Love and Courage and ultimately discover the secrets of the Shroud of the Avatar.“The story craft is not at an end,” said Garriott. “More side quests and revisions to improve quality, will continue to be added to the game month after month, yet this is the first time the full plot has been playable, and is among the last major milestones needed for a commercial launch later in the year.”The remainder of the game is already in what would traditionally be considered a beta state. There are some skill trees and recipes still needing to be completed, and plenty of balance and debugging remains, but Portalarium is now shifting its team and company into the stance of a publisher as the commercial release approaches.“This marks the 44th monthly release for Shroud of the Avatar,” exclaimed Garriott. “And these updates have occurred on the last Thursday of the month on time, and the servers have had nearly four years of continuous software stability. In Release 45, players actively testing the game will receive the ability to ‘reset’ their story status, and thus be able to get a fresh run through the now completed main quests, without having to start a new character.”Shroud of the Avatar’s original crowdfunded campaign began in 2013. Currently with more than $11.8 million in crowd funding, Shroud is the second highest fully crowd funded game ever. More information about the crowdfunding campaign and the game can be accessed at www.ShroudoftheAvatar.com .Recently Portalarium extended their crowdfunding efforts to include equity crowdfunding using the SeedInvest platform. This allows people to invest in Portalarium while backing the project. To learn more go to www.seedinvest.com/portalarium/series.b .At this year’s Gamescom in Cologne, journalists have the opportunity to interview Richard “Lord British” Garriott and Lars Janssen about the game and the new partnership.Disclaimer: Portalarium is offering securities under Regulation CF and Rule 506© of Regulation D through SI Securities, LLC (“SI Securities”). The Company has filed a Form C with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with its offering, a copy of which may be obtained here:https://www.seedinvest.com/portalarium/series.b .About PortalariumPortalarium was formed in September of 2009 in Austin, Texas. The company was co-founded by legendary game developer Richard Garriott, who created Ultima, one of the longest running and most successful fantasy role playing game series ever. The company is currently developing its next game, the crowd funded Shroud of the Avatar.About Travian Games GmbHTravian Games GmbH, based in Munich, is a world-renowned, self-publishing developer of online games. The company offers complex, multi-layered adventure worlds that inspire players with their gaming depth and guarantee long-lasting enjoyment. A motivated team develops and markets online entertainment for all age groups.

It may not be the right time for it now but I'd love to see it eventually.

By contrast, divorce rates were higher in several northern Member States, notably Lithuania (3.2 .divorces per 1 000 persons) Denmark (2.9 ), Latvia and Estonia (both 2.6).

amc12bmaa,nimble,Non-Trump Supporter,"I think one thing people don't realize that healthcare is such a nightmare in the USA has nothing to do with universal healthcare - it's how ridiculously expensive anything is. In Europe and most East Asian countries, medical services are relatively affordable. You can choose not to have insurance (or not able to afford it) - and pay out of pocket for everything. It might still cause financial strife, but at least not deeply in debt or bankrupt. 

In the US, because of how ridiculously high the costs, if you don't have insurance, you are pretty much guaranteed to land in bankruptcy to pay the entire medical bill.

It's the medical industry that needs a makeover, and healthcare reform only fixes the symptom and not the cause. 

Healthcare is needed, yes, but the high costs of even the simplest things (like ambulance rides regularly costing thousands even for close distances) causes unnecessary debts - and that incentive may lead to people who are financially struggling to not seek out medical attention and die from preventable diseases.

And I must say I was disappointed by her relentless repetition, sometimes of nearly identical phrases. 

That being said, the paper was meant to explore a rather narrow topic of Sikhi which is largely absent from academia, and she does that well, making good use of some valuable sources along the way. 

Lot's of quotable bits in there. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; One such violent encounter for example, is
described by Major W.S.R Hodson in January 1849. While marching alongside his troops
along the Doab area of Punjab, Hodson was confronted by a troop of Akalis on foot, and
as he describes, a significant mini-battle ensued:
&gt;&gt;A party of Akhalees* (Fanatics) on foot stopped and fought us,
in some instances very fiercely. One fine bold ‘Nihung’ beat off
four sowars one after another, and kept them all at bay. I then
went at him myself, fearing that he would kill one of them. He
instantly rushed to me like a tiger, closed with me, yelling, ‘Wah
Gooroo ji,’ and accompanying each shout with a terrific blow of
his tulwar. . .I never beheld such desperation and fury in my life.
It was not human scarcely.’ ^39

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;However, it is also well known,
and recorded by many, that the Nihangs physically and verbally abused the Maharaja
himself. W.G. Osborne, for example, observed that Ranjit Singh “failed in emancipating
himself from their [Nthangs’] insults and abuse.” ^172 Osborne goes on to describe these
abuses, and the extent of the power the Nihangs exhibited as “it is still a common
occurrence for them, on marching past him [Ranjit Singh], to throw handfuls of musket
balls at his feet, and abuse and insult him in every sort of manner.” ^73 Even more
appalling than the Nihangs’ very public abuses against him was the way in which the
Maharaja responded. Rather than have the trouble makers killed or imprisoned as what
would have been the case with any other abuser of the Sikh ruler, Ranjit Singh instead
“bears it all with the greatest coolness"".

-----------------------------------

&gt;The mobility of Ranjit Singh’s army was yet another unique feature which
allowed them to easily access information as all parts of the kingdom could be kept under
watch. As mentioned previously, the military would often be stationed in strategic
locations; however, it was in their mobility that complete watch over the state was
possible. Even Osborne recognized this trait of Ranjit Singh’s army in comparison to the
British, saying that “[t]he Sihk army possesses one great advantage over our own- the
ease with which it can be moved. No wheel carriage is allowed on a march, their own
bazars carry all they require; and thirty thousand of their troops could be moved with
more facility.. .than three Company’s regiments on this side the Sutlege.” ^87 In creating
such a powerful and successful army based on the knowledge learned from European
systems, Ranjit Singh utilized his army to the greatest capacity as the army allowed
conquering, provided protection, and most significantly, provided Ranjit Singh with the
intelligence and knowledge gathering he so much desired.",True,False,,0,1501573142,,1501603122,0,dl04u1b,False,t3_6qgcss,t3_6qgcss,1503663192,2,False,Sikh,t5_2rfo4,

paceymerte55,18,Scholes,"As Chelsea’s march to the title became relentless through early 2015, and Jose Mourinho looked like he might reign for a decade at a club to which he once never looked likely to return, he held forth on the decision to re-sign Nemanja Matic the previous year.

Matic had first joined the club aged 21 in 2009 after Mourinho’s first spell and he had left before the return of the club’s most successful manager, but the way in which Mourinho spoke about the Serb that day suggested that he had known about him his whole career. ""If I was here, a left footed player, Mourinho said, ""1.95 metres [tall]; position: midfield - would never, never, never leave. Never.”

Now Matic – all 1.95 metres of him - is a Mourinho player for the second time in his career, a £40 million signing for Manchester United from Chelsea, where he has steadfastly refused to negotiate a new deal and forced the hand of a club who would much prefer never to have sold him to a rival. As he done so often in his managerial career, Mourinho has returned to sign a player with whom he has achieved success in the past.

In that 2014-2015 title winning season, Matic was outstanding for Chelsea and his expensive re-acquisition came to be seen as a strength: they had made a mistake in selling him and by bringing him back they were ignoring the usual conventions and addressing their previous error. The next question to Mourinho that day in March 2015 when he listed Matic’s physical attributes was why clubs did not protect themselves with buy-back clauses, the example being cited Manchester United and Juventus’ then stand-out midfielder Paul Pogba.

Since the re-signing of Matic it has become more common for clubs to re-sign players – as with Chelsea and David Luiz, and, of course, United and Pogba. As for Mourinho, his habit of signing players he has worked with in the past seems to yield results, from Derlei and Nuno Valente, who followed him from his second job at Uniao Leiria to Porto and then later with some of the biggest names in his career, like Didier Drogba and Samuel Eto’o.

The pattern has repeated itself through every job he has had, with Mourinho consistently going back for the players he trusts. The Portuguese midfielder Maniche, as well as Edgaras Jankauskas played for Mourinho at Benfica, his first management job, before joining him in his third at Porto. He brought Ricardo Carvalho and Paulo Ferreira to Chelsea from the Porto team with whom he had conquered Europe, later also bringing Maniche on loan - the third club at which the two worked together.

At Inter Milan, Mourinho signed Hernan Crespo on loan, the Argentine striker he had inherited in his first spell at Chelsea, subsequently loaned out and then brought back for the second of his Premier League winning seasons in 2005-2006. At Real Madrid he signed Carvalho again, and the former Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien. When he went back to Chelsea for a second time, Mourinho signed Samuel Eto’o whom he had managed at Inter Milan, and Drogba, whom he first brought to Stamford Bridge in 2004, returned for a season.

Matic’s signing is part of a well-established tradition over Mourinho’s career, although he remains an unusual choice given the way it ended at Chelsea. By the end of 2015, as Chelsea’s Premier League winners fell apart and Mourinho raged at the world, Matic was one of those players whose influence had dwindled badly and in whom his manager’s faith seemed shaken.

The substitution of Matic after 28 minutes in the defeat to Southampton in October 2015, the start of a slide Mourinho could not arrest and two months before his ultimate defenestration, was one of those signals of dysfunction. Matic had come on at half-time and was replaced by the end of the game. He did, however, start the last eight games of Mourinho’s second Chelsea era, including the defeats to Stoke, Bournemouth and finally Leicester.

On Monday, Mourinho was unequivocal about Matic and hinted that the player’s stubbornness had forced Chelsea’s hand. “Nemanja is a Manchester United player and a Jose Mourinho player. He represents everything we want in a footballer; loyalty, consistency, ambition, team player. I would like to thank him for his desire to join us because without that, it would be impossible to have him here. I am sure our players and supporters will love him. A big welcome to our new number 31.”United have got nowhere with their attempts to sign Eric Dier from Tottenham Hotspur, and there would have been no guarantee that even an offer in excess of £50 million would have changed Daniel Levy’s mind. Mourinho gave United three options for every position that needed strengthening and that Matic was the most achievable of those tells you something about Spurs’ determination to keep Dier.

As ever with Mourinho it is about what works best now. After that Southampton substitution in October 2015, he admitted that Matic was “not playing well, is not sharp defensively and is making mistakes with the ball” but he did say that said that he still trusted him. As with many of those who have won trophies with Mourinho in the past, that turns out still to be the case. 

How Mourinho's jobs always follow the same pattern 
1. Takes over a club that’s struggling 
Porto -2002-04 ,Porto were fifth and out of the cup when he joined them in January 2002. 
Chelsea ,2004-07 .Chelsea had finished second under Claudio Ranieri but exited the Champions League at semi-final stage to Monaco.
Inter ,2008-10Roberto Mancini had won the Serie A title but exited the Champions League at the last 16 stage to seal his fate. 
Real Madrid -2010-13Madrid had finished second and exited the Champions League at the last 16 stage - as well as losing to lowly Alcorcon in the Spanish Cup. 
Chelsea - 2013-15Chelsea had come third and suffered an early Champions League exit - although they did win the Europa League. 
Man Utd ,2016-present .United finished fifth under Louis van Gaal but had won the FA Cup.

Real Madrid ;2010-13 Madrid again finish second but win the Copa del Rey and reach Champions League semi-finals as Mourinho lays the foundations for success. 
Chelsea ;2013-15Chelsea again finished third but reached the Champions League semi-finals. 
Man Utd ;2016-present ,United came sixth but won the Europa League (which secured a Champions League return) and the EFL Cup. 

3. Spends heavily on a striker 
Porto ;2002-04Brazilian forward Derlei was a big-money arrival from Uniao Leiria. 
Chelsea ;2004-07 Didier Drogba was a £24m arrival from Marseille. 
Inter ;2008-10 Diego Milito and Samuel Eto’o were key signings in the summer of 2009, the latter as partexchange for Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 
Real Madrid ;2010-13 Mourinho for once did not bring in a striker but he did sign Mesut Ozil from Werder Bremen. 
Chelsea ;2013-15Diego Costa joined from Atletico Madrid for £32m 
Man Utd ;2016-present Romelu Lukaku has signed from Everton for £75m. 

4. Brings in a player from his former club 
Porto ,2002-04 .Derlei and Nuno Valente both played under Mourinho at Leira, while Maniche and Jankauskas both arrived from Benfica, where he had also managed. 
Chelsea ;2004-07Ricardo Carvalho and Paulo Ferreira came from Porto, and Maniche on loan from Dynamo Moscow. 
Inter ;2008-10 ,Chelsea’s Hernan Crespo was signed on a free. Real Madrid
2010-13Ricardo Carvalho joined from Chelsea, with Michael Essien also doing the same on loan. 
Chelsea ;2013-15Samuel Eto’o joined from Anzhi, and Drogba returned from Galatasaray 
Man Utd ;2016-presentIbrahimovic signed last summer and now Nemanja Matic has joined from Chelsea in a deal that could be worth £45m. 

5. Wins the league in his second season 
Porto ;2002-04Porto finished on 86 points, 11 clear of Benfica. Chelsea
2004-07; Chelsea retained their title as they finished on 91 points, eight clear of the pack. 
Inter ;2008-10Mourinho won the treble in a recordbreaking second season. 
Real Madrid ;2010-13Madrid won their first La Liga title in four years. 
Chelsea ;2013-15Chelsea won the title with three games to spare, as well as winning the League Cup. 
Man Utd - 2016-present?

Ponyboy-Curtis,,,"Most of world history? I'll assume that by ""these white men"" you mean primarily Europeans, and by world history you mean human history; if that's the case I would have to strongly disagree. Throughout world history there has been about 2 times that Europeans were in any significant position of power, and the first time is arguable. I would say the first time was the Roman Empire. It seems like the Roman Empire is awfully late to be the first rise of power for Europeans, but I can back that up with some evidence. In the beginning of human civilization Mesopotamia and by extension the Middle East had most of the power largely because of how they were the people with civilization and all the benefits it entails. You can argue that a little bit later power shifted to India but the biggest and I would say largest shift of power would be the shift in world power to China. A lot of people forget the amount of power China had. For the majority of the history of the world China had a large role in trade and led the world in technology. I would argue that China had more power than The Roman Empire even during it's ""golden age."" For the sake of argument though I will ignore that and count the Roman Empire since it is pretty much the first large Empire in Europe that put ""white men"" in a position where they could be considered a threat to others. The Roman Empire lasted for approximately 478 years with the RE becoming an empire in 2 BCE and ending with a split in 476 CE, the Eastern side became the Byzantine Empire, but had considerably less power than the RE. The Byzantine empire shrunk with all of the land in Europe not controlled by the Byzantines or the Ottomans falling into a dark age. At that point in history ""white men"" were not in a condition to do a whole lot of damage, with the only thing keeping the Ottomans from conquering them was the Byzantine empire. There was then the crusades  which I would not consider a point of considerable power in European history, but Europeans were attacking non-white people (with most crusades failing) so I'll give those years to you. The crusades lasted from 1095-1291 so that's 196 years. Shortly after the crusades came the renaissance and again for the sake of argument I'll say that at this point Europe or the ""white men"" came into power, while I personally believe China somewhat maintained power until they lost the opium wars. Ignoring the Opium wars ""white men"" came into power during the renaissance until the present or from about 1300-present, that's 717 years. Adding the numbers up ""white men"" or Europeans have been in power for 1,391 years. That seems like a large number until you compare it to most of human history like you did with the agricultural revolution starting around 8000 BCE and continuing until present day. That's around 10,000 years. That means that ""white men"" have been dangerous for 13.91% of world history, hardly a majority. This seems like a really long rant for a one sentence comment on the internet but not only is your comment wrong but it also encourages a Eurocentric view of history ignoring all of incredibly interesting and powerful civilizations such as Ancient China, The Gupta, and The Ottomans among others.

Khatyn or Chatyń (Belarusian and Russian: Хаты́нь, pronounced [xɐˈtɨnʲ]) was a village of 26 houses and 156 inhabitants in Belarus, in Lahoysk Raion, Minsk Region, 50 km away from Minsk. On 22 March 1943, the entire population of the village was massacred by the Schutzmannschaft Battalion 118 of Ukrainische Hilfspolizei. The battalion was formed in July 1942 in Kiev and was made up mostly of Ukrainian nationalist collaborators from Western Ukraine and Hiwis, assisted by the Dirlewanger Waffen-SS special battalion.

The massacre was not an unusual incident in modern-day Belarus during World War II. At least 5,295 Belarusian settlements were burned and destroyed by the Nazis, and often all their inhabitants were killed (some amounting up to 1,500 victims) as a punishment for collaboration with partisans.

***

**The Holocaust**

The Holocaust, also referred to as the Shoah, was a genocide in which some six million European Jews were killed by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, and the World War II collaborators with the Nazis. The victims included 1.5 million children, and constituted about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had previously resided in Continental Europe. A broader definition of the Holocaust includes non-Jewish victims, such as the Romani, Poles, members of other Slavic ethnic groups, and Aktion T4 patients who were killed because they were mentally and physically disabled. An even broader definition includes Soviet citizens, prisoners of war, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, blacks, political opponents of the Nazis, and members of other smaller groups.

That depends on where you are. Sure, if you're living in a nice part of Europe or North America, capitalism looks fantastic. To the privileged ones who have much luxury to lose, socialism looks terrible. But to the ones in periphery countries, the majority of whom struggle to put meals on plates while working full-time jobs? Capitalism in core countries keeps periphery countries in abject poverty and the semi-periphery in shit conditions, while ensuring both are dependent on the core.  
  
Socialism hasn't been tried with proper checks and balances and democracy. Without those two things, it's no surprise such revolutionary changes devolve. Same thing happens with capitalist countries without property checks and democracy-- they devolve into authoritarian states.

Edit:

&gt;Yeah that's explains away the discrepancy between Sweden and the rest of the civilized world that makes Sweden #2 RAPE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD, second only to Lesotho which is full of fucking AFRICANS LMFAO.

The problem is anything but my precious brown people! Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!""

...

&gt;uh, uh, uh

Except I'm not fishing. This is all very well documented. It just doesn't fit your narrative.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics#Sweden

&gt;A frequently cited source when comparing Swedish rape statistics internationally is the regularly published report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), based on official statistics provided by each member state.[note 1] In 2012, Sweden had 66 cases of reported rapes per 100,000 population, according to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (Brå).[238] This was unequivocally the biggest number reported to the UNODC in 2012.[239] **However, widely differing legal systems, offence definitions, terminological variations, recording practices and statistical conventions makes any cross-national comparison on rape statistics difficult,[240][241][242][243] which is why the UNODC itself caution against using their figures.[239] It should also be noted that many countries do not report any rape statistics at all to the UNODC,[244] and some report very low numbers, despite studies that indicate otherwise.[245][246]**

&gt;**The Swedish police record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately, leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries.[240][243][247] Sweden also has a comparatively wide definition of rape.[240][241][242] This means that more sexual crimes are registered as rape than in most other countries.[241] For example, in 2005 Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider,[240][248][249][250] which led to a marked increase in reports.[251][252] Additionally, the Swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases, in an effort to decrease the number of unreported cases.[240][252][253][254]** For this reason, large-scale victimisation surveys have been presented by criminologists as a more reliable indicator of rape prevalence.[240][241][242] An EU-wide survey on sexual violence against women, published by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) in 2014, showed Sweden was only third highest, below Denmark and Finland[255] and a previous assessment by Brå have placed Sweden at an average level among European nations.[241]

&gt;**According to the FRA study there's a strong correlation between higher levels of gender equality and disclosure of sexual violence.[255] This, and a greater willingness among Swedish women to report rape in relationships,[256] may also explain the relatively high rates of reported rape in Sweden, which has a long-standing tradition of gender equality policy and legislation, as well as an established women's movement,[242] and has been ranked as the number one country in sex equality.[243][257]**

Turns out when you define more sexual abuse as rape than basically any other country does, actively fight for victims to come forward and feel safe and supported in doing so, and count a year's worth of a man's crimes against his wife as tens to hundreds of different rapes when most other countries would treat them as one, you end up with higher numbers. Imagine that. It's like you're aren't comparing like to like. It's like you're slamming Sweden for baring everything and taking a hard line against sexual abuse while in the U.S. we know police departments are cooking their books to meet crime reduction quotas. 

And as I've already pointed out, *most rapes in Sweden are committed by people who live with or are otherwise close to their victims.* So this idea that immigrants are going around raping white Swedes is silly. Even the ""Conservative Bible,"" National Review had to acknowledge as much, knowing full well they'd get hissy fits from people like you.

&gt;Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

You're certainly doing a lot of that, yes.

Uuuh, um, no that's retarded.  

&gt;And yeah, the color/gender swapping is kind of cheap, but the traditionally white characters have such a head start in popular culture that it's the only way to get minority characters on the same playing field

Also false

If you want minorities to be in comics and on the same playing field you need to have good writers full stop.  Color\gender swapping doesn't put them on the same playing field because no body buys the comics.  The drop in sales go down like 80 percent.  No one wants to read about Falcon as Captain America.  To think that you will appeal to black people simply because you have black characters is a huge fallacy and it's why sales drop after any #1 book. Yeah... you heard me right, black people want to read about white Captain America.  It's because they're not fucking stupid and shameless pandering won't work on them.  Ever hear the line, judge someone not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character?  Well all the color swapped superheroes at marvel are shittily written characters.  The culture at Marvel Comics right now is a shit show, so you won't see good writers coming their way.  It's rather embarrassing.   

It's hard to take you seriously when you're misinformed.

&gt;Minorities want to read/watch good characters, but it's nice to see someone like you on the screen

White people are like you, believe it or not.  If you can't empathize with a white protagonist you have problems.  If you have a deep resentment over white people you should realize first off that white people is a term Americans use and that it's too general to even be meaningful.  Secondly there are entire countries of white people who had nothing to do with the slave trade or exploitation of black people, for example Russia.  Russia has been dicked around and exploited by Europe comparable to Africa but when you talk about white people you include them even though they had nothing to do with black suffering.  I hope you realize that white people are not so different from black and by being American you are already privileged no less then the majority of whites in the States.  Constantly seeing them as the enemy will not serve your goals.  

&gt;Miles Morales is awesome,
He's badly written, same problem as the other super heroes.  You're not going to appeal except for children if the writing is garbage.

Ce qu'ils disent ""fais sens"" s'ils ont ancré que c'était une dispute de voisinage. Ça fait mal mais c'est vrai: les disputes de voisinage, même graves, ne sont PAS une affaire de police.

Les bonnes solutions sont d'avoir une aide juridique pour cerner une approche et un process: 

- trouve un avocat ou une aide juridictionnelle. Il y en a des pas chers qui vont t'aider en 1h de conseil

- demande une copie à l'hopital, porte plainte pour coups et blessures volontaires en réunion par courrier recommandé au procureur de la république _et va te chercher un putain d'avocat_

Enfin il y a plein de problemes dans ton témoignage et je pense que tu devrais éditer pour les supprimer. 

- Ce que tu décris sur l'interruption temporaire de travail: ""Les gendarmes ne veulent pas te la rendre""? Ça ne veut rien dire. Si tu as eu une ITT, comme écris au dessus, demande une copie à l'hopital, porte plainte pour coups et blessures volontaires en réunion par courrier recommandé au procureur de la république.

France already collaborated. UK was sort of mucking around on its ass, but the fact that Hitler had allowed the Dunkirk evacuation of the British troops, showed that he had soft feelings for the Brits, and if the war hadn't turned with the Red Army shoving Wehrmacht out, they'd probably sooner or later struck a peace deal.

As such, US wouldn't be involved as much, concentrating on the Pacific, and the result would be an Axis-spearheaded Europe, with the Eastern European nations (including Russia) de-populated and turned into slave labor colonies and ""lebensraum"".

But, I want to underline it - Western Europe would remain pretty much civilizationally intact. France, UK, a fascist Italy, Spain the neutral Switzerland, they'd all enjoy life with the Reich. None of the atrocities we know of now, will be publicized. Everything will be swept under the rug to re-build a post-war society. The Third Reich will not be seen as evil in this reality, just another European territory squabble, with the only losers being the subhuman Slavics.

However, even if the second machine were perfected and widely used, that would have the effect of rendering 90% of fruit-picking jobs obsolete. So such jobs would no longer be available - not for immigrants, sure - but not for native British workers either.

Which links into what job theft is really being caused by. It isn't immigration or immigrants - the vast majority of job losses over the last 50 years or so have been due to mechanization and automation. It is greedy employers who would rather buy a robot than employ actual people who are to blame, not foreigners.

EDIT 1: Also, if you really are concerned about job losses, you should be concerned about brexit itself. Leaving the EU won't save any jobs from immigrants, mainly because immigrants don't steal our jobs anyway but also because brexit won't stop or reduce immigration. But brexit will cause a plethora of job losses in other areas - jobs which are currently filled mainly by British people, jobs which we are unlikely to get back. Well done there.

There is something going on in Russia right now. One of our tabloids, iltalehti, interviewed some Russians when they had their navy parade. Apparently people are concerned about the rise in ""Nazism and fascism"" in Europe. I remember reading Suomen Kuvalehti (quality journalism) around 2008 and being concerned about an article written about how they are washing the face of Stalin- and now Stalin is more popular than he has been in ages. Around the same time I remember reading a short article on how Russia voted that they have the right to invade if Russians are threatened in foreign lands. There are people paid to spread Russian propaganda online and they have definitely succeeded at least on some point confusing and convincing people. Most importantly, there is still a war in Ukraine. We don't talk about it, but there _is_ a war in Ukraine. This is a nation that is currently going to war (and according to this article above us, the whole thing happened because of the Kiev had a rise of a nazi-junta, NATO/EU/USA creating the whole mess). 


This article isn't an exception, just a few days ago there was a ""historian"" explaining on a channel that has about 20 million viewers how Finland's independence was illegal and how it ""would be better if Finland belonged to Russia again"". Russian media also found the American article about Finns digging tunnels to protect civilians hilarious (btw it is false), kindly stating how any depth will not protect us if they release their army's might on us.


I spot false history and downright propaganda about Finland all the time in Reddit- what tends to concern me the most is not even the posts but the number of upvotes so many of them tend to have. Common theme is that Finland either chose or deserved the war, that we were a nazi-buffer state and USSR only attacked to protect itself, that there really weren't  a Molotov-Ribbentrop-pact, that Finland ""switched sides"" during the war, blah blah and so on and so on.


I'm very concerned about the fact how vividly ww2 lives in our everyday lives, how much we discuss it, or more like how much it is used as a propaganda tool. It's like nations are defined by it, not what is happening right now today. 


Edit: I just have to add, more than anything I am just tired about this. So _fucking_ tired. We have just now started to really recover from the wars. It will take multiple generations until the scars are finally healed. We are not a threat, not harming anyone, just minding our own business living our own lives. And let's face it, we do have a pretty nice standard of living and respect for human rights, we are a nice country. 


My grandparents had nothing but one wish: Never again. That no Finn (or what comes to it not anyone else, including the Russians and the rest of the world, my grandfather on father's side was always very strict to remind that those men attacking them where forced to be there, just like they were, that it was all just the cruel game of the elite with the lives of regular, good people) would have to lose their health, mental health, home, life or the lives of their loved ones, friends, family, neighbors, wives, husbands, children... War is pure hell, pure torture, mindless, horrible waste of lives. Both sides of my family were horribly traumatized and many died (my grandfather lost his family completely, my grandmother all six of her brothers, my grandmother's father died and many more) , my grandfather from my mother's side maybe the most, he saw his own best childhood friend since infants being blown up in front of his eyes, he was very unstable mentally, tried to self-medicate with alcohol and had horrible pain in his left shoulder that never healed. If this was just Russia cooking up propaganda to get to their own domestic goals using Finland as a tool (meaning creating an enemy to strengthen their political goals, I do not mean accepting violence or them invading other countries), I guess I could live with it. Of course it wouldn't be ideal, but what can you do. It would still have some toll, like reduce the number of Russian tourists or them coming here to live on summer cottages, which would be very unfortunate. But if this is a way of slowly starting to build up a foundation to something else, painting a hostile image of us as enemies, well... Well, I don't really have words to describe how would I feel about that.

* **Singles Match** Finn Balor vs Aleister Black - Titty sprinkles, please.

* **Singles Match** Drew McIntyre vs Trent Seven - I'm not sure that Drew would tower over the guy, but I think these two would be good in a match together.

* **WWE Raw Tag Team Championships** - Cesaro and Sheamus vs Killian Dain and Eric Young.  Okay, I get it.  Eric Young isn't from Europe.  Forgive me... he and Asuka will be the only ones.  

* **WWE Cruiserweight Championship** - Neville (c) vs. Mark Andrews.  How this guy wasn't immediately put onto 205 Live is beyond me.  It's a natural fit there.  And if you don't think these two could steal the whole damn show, you're out of your mind.

iamsander,,,"1. We have a large Indonesian community. There are many people of mixed  Indo/Dutch heritage (like myself). You can get (watered down) Indonesian food everywhere, like in supermarkets and in Chinese restaurants :D But the people in the Indonesian community mostly go to proper Indonesian restaurants or they cook it themselves. It's a huge difference.
2. We used to have some rivalry with the Germans. Of course the WW2 had to do with it, but they are also our bigger, more successful brother. The last 10 years most people think mostly positive about Germany though. Our southern neighbor Belgian is generally liked. We think their accent is charming. We have less in common with the French speaking part of Belgium though. 
3. You hear a lot of EDM here. Martin Garrix, Tiesto, Afrojack etc. Besides that the general Popstars like Ed Sheeran.
4. I think most Dutch people don't know that the Dutch also colonized Malaysia for some time. They know about Indonesia, South Africa and Surinam.  In general not much attention goes to the colonies in history lessons. And what we learn is mostly positive. The 1600s are called our golden century and the colonization is mostly seen as a sign of the entrepreneurship of the Dutch. It is mostly talked about with pride, which bothers me. However, the last few years there are more and more discussions in the media about the dark sides of colonization by the Dutch.
5. In Dutch we use many weird expressions and sayings. Example: Je moet geen oude koeien uit de sloot halen. Literal translation: Don't get old cows out of the ditch. Meaning: don't bring up negative events from the past.
6. We think we're protected well and that we will find a solution if the water rises. Check this wiki for how we protected the land after the flood of 1953: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Works
7. The educational system is actually good. Many foreign students are coming to study here. Holland has the most English-taught bachelors in Europe after England and Ireland (obviously). 
8: National dishes are: boerenkool met worst, which is kale with mash potatoes and smoked sausage. But actually any vegetable can be mashed with potatoes, which is called stamppot. So you can mix it with carrot (hutspot), spinach or other veggies. Erwtensoep is also famous. It's a very thick pea soup with slices of sausage, carrot and celeriac. But since Holland is quite a mixed country we have been influenced by many cuisines. People eat pasta quite often, but also Chinese, Indonesian and Thai food. 

Answers to your questions regarding studying:

1. Make sure you join the introduction week. In Groningen it is called Kei Week. You'll definitely make friends already. Join some clubs, like sports clubs. 

2. Dutch people are known to be easy to talk to for small talk. They are quite witty and like to make small jokes. However, to really become friends and be invited to someone's house can take some time. Your student years are probably the years you make the most friends, so don't miss out on that. It also helps if you learn Dutch. In general we all speak English, but if you meet only Dutch people everyone has to adapt to you and speak English.

Não se trata de perpetuar mitos porque eu lembro-me bem de dar a escravatura em contexto e lembra-se disso quem não se estivesse completamente nas tintas paras as aulas, o problema da investigadora é que *não se dá que chegue* quando desde já é extremamente difícil alongar tópico algum dada a extensão da História de Portugal.

Para mais, acho a argumentação dela falaciosa; mal apresenta provas do que diz para além dela dizer que sim, não apresenta alternativas, não diz que parte é que temos que deixar de dar para incluirmos mais escravatura, mas sobretudo, e eu acho que este é o problema principal do raciocínio dela e que vai de acordo com uma corrente recente que eu notei, é dar excessiva importância à escravatura e menosprezar outras áreas igualmente relevantes da História.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

Try the Starter Edition ([US](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition) / [EU](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition)) to get a free taster of WoW, then:

I live in the american mid west and i only see people that don't need to be having kids, having kids. By that i mean, mom and dad both have minimal education, they are both morbidly obese, wearing glasses and the kids are already overweight and seem.... off?

Every once in a while (this past Sunday, actually) when i come across a good looking family that has also reproduced. She had blonde hair and the husband had light brown hair, but they had this row of 4 kids with bright, platinum blonde hair and blue eyes. All of them were healthy weight, very bright, and well behaved. Even the mother, for having 4 kids in quick succession (the all looked to be about a year apart) looked very attractive. 

It made me feel good to see that, instead of seeing some pretty white girl with a half black mongrel on her hip. Which, honestly, is far too common now. However, it also reaffirmed by belief that i shouldn't have children. 

It was actually the major break between my ex-wife and I. She is of eastern european decent (tall, brown hair, blue eyes, beautiful) and i told her that i didn't feel right passing on my genes. She was okay with that at first, but as her biological clock started to tick and all her friends started having kids, she finally decided she couldn't live a life like that and decided to leave. She met a man that is of polish decent and they both hope to have children soon. Which, i think is great. Her genes need to be passed on, mine don't.

&gt; * Almost 500 people accused of involvement in last years failed coup in Turkey have gone on trial.

&gt; * The mass trial, which kicked off at a purpose-built courtroom outside Ankara on August 1, is the largest yet relating to last year's failed putsch against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

&gt; * The case centers around the Akinci air base, northwest of the capital, which the government says the coup plotters used as their headquarters.

&gt; * The trial is one of dozens that are under way in Turkey in relation to the failed putsch that resulted in about 250 deaths in July 2016.

bushwakko,ancom,,"&gt;The average 60s auto-equipped US car was still an ancient body-on-frame construction.

Well, which is probably cheaper to make, resulting in cheaper cars.

&gt;As I said - we just never had the ability to hone the tech, because it never broke into the mainstream.

If you argument is that in the case of market capitalism, which most of europe and the US had in the 60s, then you need rich people to buy cars to finance R&amp;D. Maybe it's because the US had more rich people. But this isn't the sub to debate which variations of capitalism is ""the best"". This also ignores that the US infrastructure is built around everyone having a car, people spend more time in cars, it's a larger continuous market, has bigger distances, has more places that are really hot etc.

&gt;What are those? 

I described them in earlier posts.

&gt;Why did automatic transmissions not benefit from those?

Because they were hypothetical mechanisms meant to show how you can achieve under socialism/communism, similar research and production development as the ""rich people buying luxury items"" mechanism from capitalism that you believe is very effective.

&gt;Let me ask you a question. In an economy-driven market, it pays to introduce new tech, because people will pay a big premium. In this economy, we do it because it's right, right?

In this alternative economy we do it because you ""Trickle-down economics of goods and services come to a halt"", and I wanted to show that it would be possible to design a system with the same result without capitalist markets. What we wanted was to develop the productive capacities and the technology to the same level, so we could produce the same things with the same productivity. The simplest way to get to that result (both definitely not the only way) would be to emulate the mechanisms we know bring that about. I'm not agreeing with you that this is the best, fastest or most efficient way to do it, just that it would follow be like capitalism. The fastest way would be to decide to put everyone into researching automatic transmission technology and production, but that would of course be bad.

&gt;Now what happens if we can engineer a technology more related to the everyday car/phone whatever, but its development cost is equal to that of honing the more luxurious (more expensive to produce, less useful, uses rare materials) tech? In an economy-driven market both will be developed, because both will pay for themselves.

I'm not sure what you mean here. Are you concerned about us not producing something that would be produced in a market economy?

&gt;If we do progress pro bono, who pays for it? The same charity of people that should cover all healthcare, all social benefits and so on?

Again, you don't really know what communism if you have to ask who pays for it. There are production facilities which produce things out of resources that are mined/refined/grown. These things are then distributed by a mechanism that isn't money and decisions about what products to make are made by mechanisms that isn't money. Both could be a democratic decisions made by a community (this is typically what is envisioned with communism) or even a federation of communities, it could be decided by the workers at each specific place based on an application process, or it could be decided democratically by a federation of these different work places (typically called syndicalism) or it could even be socialist market solution (typically mutualism). The latter market would be very different from the capitalist market. 

The end product would then be distributed to the consumer by one of many different mechanisms. It could just grabbing what you need for all necessities and even all non-scarce product, for the rest it could be based on simple or advanced forms of lottery, it could be based on labor note systems that reward someone who works more, or do harder work more (and this could again be chosen democratically or to fill certain positions that no one wants to do or a combination).

&gt;it's saying that all people can't afford everything, no matter what society.

If you rephrase it as, ""we don't have the time and resources to produce everything for everyone"" you get closer to the real issue. Money is just one way to decide who get access to how much of the value produced.

&gt;I understand it as making sure nobody owns the means of production - no factory or land owners, but I presume smaller business owners would be fine. 

A small business owner wouldn't be an owner, unless he was working by himself. If there are more than one person working on something, there are also more than one owner.

&gt;Also, I understand the distinction between private and personal property.

Not many do though, the typical distinction between these things comes from the justice system under capitalism and is just different groups of property that is covered by the same property system. I've written about it in a different comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/6nuly2/collectivist_anarchism_and_property/dkdjqzr/

&gt;But again - this means we would all be somewhere between poorish and upper middle class at very best.

Assuming that only the system changes and the material conditions stay the same, the same value would exist. However, since private property is abolished, the costs associated with the ability to require people to pay for access to it is gone, aka the rent costs (not the cost of maintenance etc though). This cost is baked into the monetary value of everything, which means current prices are inflated above the cost of production. For example, every time you pay for flour, you also pay for the cost of the land that grows flour in the market, because the cost of buying said land meant someone had to get a mortgage and pay someone for it, including interest as well. Even if everyone on the market had paid down their mortgage, they would still factor in the price they would get for it if they as owners rented it out instead.

So we could produce the same things, or we could produce different things, but the biggest change would be how we distributed what we produced. ""We"" would have the same things, only distributed differently. We would all also be richer, because things that previously belonged to one entity, would now belong to all.

So the more common questions is how do we get people to work. Personally, I think the current way of work or starve isn't an ethical way to do it. Also, when we force everyone to have work in a market, it means that everyone will compete in accepting the lowest value for work that most can do. Private property makes this even worse, by limiting what people are able to do. It also accumulates value produced by previous generations in the hands of the few. So most of all capital that was produced in the previous generation, with input from most of the workers of that generation, is generating profits for the few who owns them, and none for those who were paid once to make them. Every time we create new productive capital, we should all get richer, and since new productive capital can be used to create even more productive productive capital, we should get exponentially richer. However, [The worlds 8 richest men, own as much value as the half the world population](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-davos-meeting-inequality-idUSKBN150009), and since their values are productive as well, they're going to own even more.

Another important point I think as well, is that while markets where rich people buy things that spur innovation make good examples, there is also examples of rich people buying things that doesn't help anything. In these cases, we don't end up with nice technology, we just waste huge amounts of labor time and resources on making things for potentially one person or a small group. Yachts, for example, might be good examples of this. And even if they do generate something of value, there might be other much less resource intensive ways to get it, or ways that would benefit more people.",True,False,,0,1501587505,,False,0,dl0adgm,False,t3_6pudyi,t1_dl07h4w,1503666036,1,False,DebateaCommunist,t5_2t9dp,

The tribal mentality comes from the families, and kinsmen who have frown together. Hence tribal feuds with others.

Now the Native Americans who have been to Europe and have written and documented things that is a question that will have to be put on hold. I am sorry that I can't continue the conversation more fully. But you pose a great search that would contribute to better dialogue between Native and non-Natives in America and larger global discussions of indigenous discourse.

Is there a particular timeline that you want of Native personal documentation? Do you want 17th century, 18th century, 19th and so on...

You will probably have to wait a year or so for a quality answer there. If I get accepted into the Indigenous Law program I am looking at there will be a lot of law built from the early 17th century to the present over the course of the program. As I would learn I would channel the conversation and sources to the thread and you.

For the Dark Ages, that is a thought experiment worth drawing up for discussion. I could give a good alternative history question with analysis in a week or so if you wait.

It seems the questions worth discussing that build society take years and years.

The ones you linked are sparse, about 1 per year since 2015 and almost all of them are completely out of Riot's control whereas Valve has hardly made the minimum of effort. The C9 visa issue was directly related to the Trump/border drama a few months ago and was also possibly an excuse simply because C9 didn't want to go, it's become a fad for NA LCS teams to skip invites to small tourneys like this to focus on LCS. The EDG visa issue is definitely legit, but that's going from China to Poland, not China to America which there has been no problem with. In short the 2017 examples are not relevant.

 The S6 visa issues were very real and were the beginning of Riot cracking down and sorting out the issues making sure every one was abiding by the rules. Hopefully this is the point valve will reach soon. However the visa issues in America were limited to one team, and in Europe they were caused by specific German Law. What is a significant detail though? None of this happened during their TI or in fact at any significant period for competition. 

In 2015 Xmithie was the only player with a visa issue and he ended up making it to the tournament just fine.

NotALeftist,,,"&gt; Factually inaccurate. Although many go home , many stay. Those who leave are included in the yearly net migration stats. The ratio of those staying to leaving still ends up with 100,000 extra people in the country each year. Many of which statistically have to be unskilled.

Net migration figure is irrelevant to the fact that most go home after working. You're mixing up statistics. They don't want to stay here to retire. Most leave after a few years.

&gt; The idea that for every new immigrant , a new job is created for the person displaced due to the growing economy is ridiculous

Nobody is ""displaced"", EU migrants are working in skill shortage industries, and the stats prove this.

&gt; It is for natives according to bank of england

False. This is something that you just made up. The BOE stats included migrant wages. Stop lying to try to make a point.

&gt; also your own report does not say what you say it says "" So we need empirical evidence to settle the issue of whether the economic impact of immigration is bad or good for people born in the UK. "" I would suggest reading past the headline.

Haha are you stupid? This is framing the report. They are saying ""Empirical evidence is needed which is why this research is relevant"". It's a research justification you tool. Its so obvious that you didn't read it, the whole report is empirical bloody evidence using the available ONS data.

&gt; Evidence please. Its not true for unskilled migrants. They would have to be earning 39,000 to be tax neutral.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

Try the Starter Edition ([US](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition) / [EU](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition)) to get a free taster of WoW, then:

First, never, ever buy textbooks from the campus bookstore if you can help it.  No matter where you go, that's the most expensive option.  Aggregate websites like BigWords.com and AbeBooks.com tend to be your best option for purchasing or renting a textbook.

Second, always directly ask the professor if textbooks are required for their course.  Many will answer a polite email before the start of the semester.

Third, the international editions of most books are generally identical to the us editions.  The differences when they exist are lower quality paper and different end of chapter questions.  

Fourth, the vast majority of the classes you will take will have the textbooks and solutions manuals on reserve at the libraries.  Use this to your advantage.  You can get the international editions for reading and check your homework at the library to make sure you have the right questions.

Fifth, many textbooks are available as pdfs and can be found online through less than or in some cases completely legal means.  Many European universities post pdf copies of their textbooks.  I carry a thumb drive with copies of many of my textbooks and my coursework on it.  It's saved my grade more than once.

Finally, get to know your classmates.  A bit of networking goes a long way to help you figure out what you need to know.  Some classes don't use the textbooks much, they use the professor's lectures.  Some classes have everything posted online and you don't typically get a lot out of the lecture.  Some professors are really awesome and others kinda suck.  Some professors use basically the same exams over and over again.  Some always assign a group project.  The best way to find out which is which is to get to know the people around you.

soskrood,AncapCat,This isn't true capitalism - you're still here,"&gt; China's history has got a lot of revolutions in it. Most dynasties changed that way. 

There was a period from ~200 bce - ~900 ce that had relatively rapid dynastic changes.  However, outside that 1100 year period, all but 1 of the dynasties lasted ~300 years or more.  That is a lot of stability.  Even with these dynastic changes, the Chinese view themselves as a 5000 year old civilization.  That is not something Americans can relate to, or even most Europeans.  

In any case, there is certainly a cultural propensity to view the central authority (whether a dynastic house or the 'communist party') as a good / wise / mandated by god authority.  This is why they can mandate even ridiculous policies like the 'one child policy' and have it remain in effect for 35 years.

I find this quote quite revealing:
&gt;""As a Chinese citizen you can't have your own opinion! It's a fundamental national policy, it's the law!"" She kindly repeats herself for my benefit—I am a foreigner who doesn't quite grasp this simple and obvious fact. ""There is no personal opinion, do you understand?""

&gt;**Within Brussels expert circles and EU institutions, there is a widely agreed opinion that due to its divisive impact on the EU and its possible negative consequences, NS2 is an “unnecessary investment”**. As chairman of the ITRE committee of the European Parliament, MEP Jerzy Buzek, forcefully stated: there is a political consensus to reject this project. This cold reception of NS2 is based on considerations about its market and security of supply diminishing effects. Supporters of this point of view mention that NS2, while not providing any new resources to the market, will contribute to strengthening the position of the already dominant company – Gazprom, providing it with excessive pipeline optionality, useful for manipulating gas prices. It poses also threats of further market concentration and limitation of competition particularly in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Furthermore, changed patterns of gas flows in Europe would result in redirection of long-term gas contracts for Central Eastern and Southern Europe via Germany, blocking West – East interconnections capacities and limiting diversification options, thereby increasing the price of gas.

The Blue Pill mythology really got it's biggest push in 1911.

Two world wars in Europe killed off the men strong enough to fight.

But the bombs and bullets of those wars didn't care if you were masculine, so rather than killing more cowards (as in wars with swords) you ended up more likely to survive if you couldn't fight.

Remember ""Hogan's Heroes""?

Sargent Schultz becomes the type of guy that survives the war.

Volesco,EART,Earth,"Russia seems to be one of the more extreme examples of the rise in far-right populism that has been happening seemingly all across the world recently. Turkey, China, various Western and Eastern European countries alike, the USA, Australia, the Philippines ... they all seem to be experiencing similar sort of phenomena (albeit to drastically different degrees, of course).

Hell, even ISIS and the rise of Islamic extremism is also a kind of xenophobic, far-right populism, albeit one based around religion rather than nation/race/culture (and one which promotes a romanticized, revisionist view of history).

Xenophobia, anti-globalism, and historical revisionism abound. Countries all around the world are looking back to a romanticized, fantastical version of their own country's history that was never actually a reality (glorious USSR, make America great again, the push for ""patriotic education"" in China, the ""everything was better before the EU"" sentiment in the UK, and so on).

Another element of this phenomenon is that each movement focuses much of their anger around an ""enemy"", on whom they blame all their problems. In Russia, Turkey and the Middle East, that enemy is the West. In the EU, the enemy is Muslims, Russia, and sometimes the EU itself. In China, it's the West and Japan. In the USA, it's Muslims, Mexico, China, and so on.

I guess people find it easier to blame ""outsiders"" for their problems. It presents a seemingly simple solution to problems which are actually very complex. If all our problems are caused by the outsiders, then all we have to do is get rid of the outsiders. But if our problems stem mostly from internal causes, then there's no simple solution. And this kind of thinking is encouraged by various governments too, as a way to deflect the anger of the populace away from the government. Russia is a great example of this. Oh, our economy is struggling? Of course that's because of the evil westerners trying to weaken us by imposing sanctions on us! It has nothing to do with our aggressive foreign policy at all! Which, of course, you should totally support because we're just fighting the foreigners who obviously seek to destroy us. Just look at the sanctions they imposed on us!

It seems that Russia is actively encouraging these movements as well (Trump, Le Pen, etc.). I'm sure they're not that large a *causal* factor, and it's more just that they're exploiting the trend and trying to destabilize the West, but it's concerning nonetheless. It shows how this whole thing forms a positive feedback loop. As each group moves further to the right, they antagonize each other further, which causes even more mistrust and antagonism between them, which drives them further apart.

dangerstein,,,"Sorry for the cut and paste dump, but I'm on my phone at work. From the Wikipedia article on covenants:

Before 1948, these covenants were legally used for segregationist purposes.[17] In the United States in the 1920s and 1930s, covenants that restricted the sale or occupation of real property on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion or social class were common in the United States, where the primary intent was to keep ""white"" neighbourhoods ""white"". Such covenants were employed by many real estate developers to ""protect"" entire subdivisions. The purpose of an exclusionary covenant was to prohibit a buyer of property from reselling, leasing or transferring the property to members of a given race, ethnic origin and/ or religion as specified in the title deed. Some covenants, such as those tied to properties in Forest Hills Gardens, New York, also sought to exclude working class people however this type of social segregation was more commonly achieved through the use of high property prices, minimum cost requirements and application reference checks.[18]:131–7 In practice, exclusionary covenants were most typically concerned with keeping out African-Americans, however restrictions against Asian-Americans, Jews and Catholics were not uncommon. For example, the Lake Shore Club District in Pennsylvania, sought to exclude various minorities including Negro, Mongolian, Hungarian, Mexican, Greek and various European immigrants.[18] Cities known for their widespread use of racial covenants include Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, Los Angeles, and St. Louis.

90% of the housing projects built since World War II have been racially restricted by such covenants.[19]

...

During the 1920s, the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People(NAACP) sponsored several unsuccessful legal challenges against racial covenants. In a blow to campaigners against racial segregation, the legality of racial restrictive covenants was affirmed by the landmark Corrigan v. Buckley 271 U.S. 323 (1926) judgment that ruled that such clauses constituted ""private action"" and as such were not subject to the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[21]:31[22] As a result of this decision, racial restrictive covenants proliferated across the United States during the 1920s and 1930s.

Even the invalidation of such a covenant by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1940 case of Hansberry v. Lee did little to reverse the trend because the ruling was based on a technicality and failed to set a legal precedent.[21]:57 It was not until 1948 that the Shelley v. Kraemer judgment overturned the Corrigan v. Buckley decision in stating that exclusionary covenants were unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment and were therefore legally unenforceable.[21]:94[23][24]

...

In 1968, Congress passed the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968) which outlawed housing discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In 1988, it was expanded to prohibit discrimination based on familial status (e.g. the presence of children) or disability.[26]

This is absolutely accurate
This is what is driving Soros to spend billions flooding the EU with the brown hordes.
More immigrants, coupled with liberalism and political correctness, means less opportunity for Europeans to get organised, and we all know what happens when Europeans get organised

More non-whites means the Jews also don't stand out as much and so are less of a target when things go south. notice how ""Islamophobia"" is more acceptable than anti-Semitism.

We've just been taught this during the Multicultural Era.

Jumaai,,,"The best investment you can do with this amount of money is invest it in yourself. Try to expand your earning potential. If 1000 pln is a lot for your family, then you should try to for example go to http://osom.pl/ and get a excavator license(ask around people you know, internet etc, its important to get a good certifications and while general rules of thumb apply, your local companies might have different needs than my local companies) - it will instantly bump your salary to 4k gross/month, with up to 4k net after a few years of being a reliable worker that gets new certifications and permissions.

Investing it in markets will get you maybe 3% per year, investing it in yourself will get you probably over 1000% per year, and after two or three years you will be able to invest 1000 per month into the markets, or maybe fund your wife to start her own company. If you will have basic cash, your opportunities will be far bigger than with 1000 in the markets, barely over working paycheck to paycheck. 

Another option is investing that in airplane tickets to Western Europe and coming back in two years with 50k or 100k Euro saved, ready to start a company or a family.

It's the crown jewels of the UK, contributing 34% to tax revenue (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38218662) and any EU country would love to have that kind of tax revenue.

So for the 75%, they can either scramble for another job elsewhere in the sector with the companies remaining (who won't have to pay as much because if there's that many unwilling to move it's a hiring market).  Alternatively they can quit the industry and become something else entirely.  Some most certainly will out of desire or necessity but I can't see all of them doing it...

No, I reckon quite a lot more of them than just 25% will move especially if they get relocation assistance in terms of local people to help them settle in (I had that when I moved to Germany ref where to live, rent or buy, navigating local government regulations e.g. registering my presence at the town hall), one off financial payments to helping them settle in, language courses, etc.",True,False,,1,1501595412,,1501598931,0,dl0fgji,False,t3_6qw7xk,t3_6qw7xk,1503668587,5,False,london,t5_2qkog,

In short, it looks like the increased usage of mail armour (Lorica hamata) in late antiquity as opposed to the Lorica segmentata was down to comfort and efficiency. Hamata were pretty effective - mail armour stayed around for almost a thousand years after the fall of the Roman Empire in Western Europe, and for good reason. It represents a flexible, (relatively) easily obtainable piece of armour that protects against most slashing or cutting blows. Compared to the Segmentata, which was expensive to produce, procure and maintain, it definitely had its advantages. It should be noted that the Hamata didn't 'die out' for a couple centuries. Rather the two forms of armour were used together, in addition to the Lorica Squamata, or scale armour. After the crisis of the 3rd century, Roman industrial production of armour takes a significant hit - the hamata became more common as a result. 

Essentially the segmentata was only widely used for a brief segment of Roman military history, and even then it wasn't ubiquitous. Of course you won't get that impression looking at any reproductions of Roman armies on screen ;)

beefprime,,,"&gt; Well you can conspicuously find time to get the warm fuzzy tweets and hit pieces but can't seem to find anything else, several hours and your own lie about time constraints obviously outed. I see a bias, I call a bias. Maybe it's unconscious? But avoidance of acknowledging a negative in favor of preferred outcomes is just that: apologizing.

The tweets are trivial, the articles I found after I went home from work.

&gt;The Christian worldview was neutered several hundred years ago. The state and religion bond was forever broken there. You know, like how everyone thinks the Vatican is a joke? They used to rule countries.

The Christian world view was going strong and still is going strong right up until today, if you think the state/religion bond has been forever broken can you explain why multiple european states still have a combined state/religion system (such as Sweden or the UK), and why Christians in the US are constantly calling for a breakdown of the wall between state and religion?

&gt;Now they can't even get Condoms right.

Since when was religion about getting things right?

&gt;Islam has no compunction about this whole ruling countries thing.

Not right now, sure. But if you have any knowledge of history you'd know that thats a pretty new phenomenon based on the evisceration of various middle east nationalist/secular movements after World War II during the Cold War, not an inherent condition of the region/religion. This was done for geo-political reasons and, combined with the support of dictators and scum like the Saudis has resulted in dramatic radicalization of the region.

&gt;See above about apologetics.

Again: what apologetics? I at no point have pretended that Islam is a good thing (in fact I'd rather have all religions fuck off), at no point have I defended particular statements by the woman in question (in fact I explicitly state some are shitty ideas), I'm just not willing to participate in a thoughtless witch hunt based on half truths and slander.

&gt;Even the most wealthy and modern Islamic theocracies cannot even be tangentially described as what you just said.

Whats this in reference to? See my comment about recent history of the region above, the idea that Islamic countries simply cannot secularize or separate church and state is a fallacious one based on a very limited reading of recent history that lacks all context in why things are like they are.

&gt;It means all forms of struggle. It is all forms of adversarial conflict outside of ones relationship with Allah. It means war just as much as it means passive aggressive snide remarks against a small time rival; context is vital. Surprise, I'm not one of those weirdos who haetes the moslems without reading their books.

Okay, so you personally are not using her comment about Jihad to smear her character, but other people are. But my conversation with you has never been about attacking you personally, its been about ascertaining the character of Sarsour and the coverage of her.

&gt;Yes, pranciful unicorn, it can and often does mean violent struggle.

It can and often does, but again not all the time. Its a very general word, so whats your point? Why are you even bothering to go into this if you aren't hung up on this woman's use of the word jihad?

&gt;Err, no, you just ad hoc rescued your self by inverting what your decrying; They use and assume the definition unfavorably, you use and assume it favorably. You're both equally dishonest because NEITHER of you are using it or interpreting it correctly. This is pretty cut and dry dishonesty.

Assuming neutrality is not the same as taking a favorable stance.

&gt;Being a theocrat or proponent of said automatically puts you into my ""Bad people who do bad thing"" box.

Except you are judging this without looking at the results of said theocracy or the results of the alternatives, which I would disagree with. Is the theocratic regime of Iran shitty? Yes. Is it shittier than the country still living under the Shah? No, because Iranians having some self determination is better than them continuing to live under an abusive foreign puppet regime.

&gt;You just agreed Islam is not compatible with feminism. But above you said differently.

I explicitly said that it may or may not be compatible with feminism based on how the religion is practiced. I'm not sure why you suddenly think I believe its cannot be compatible. My comments about Israel are based on your own assessment that Islam is not compatible with feminism, not mine.

The article also notes that ""the apocalyspe is endlessly postponed"" as you yourself is also doing. You're either saying it's coming now due to slightly weakened UK GDP growth, or won't come until we've left. 

There's also other factors at play, there's been a sharp drop in diesel car sales accounting for a large chunk of the drop in new car sales as more reports are published turning the general public against the purchase of said new diesel cars while production lines continued on the assumption purchase rates would remain the same, they have not.

This would also be the *third* such prediction so far put forward by people on the Pro-EU side of things and the sky has yet to fall in. 

They said we'd see an instant shock and collapse in the FTSE 100 on the day we left, which didn't happen. Indeed the FTSE 100 continues to perform strongly.

Then we were told to see how the FTSE 250 was doing woefully and that was the ""true measure of the cost of brexit as they were actual british companies"" (the 250 is over 5,000 points higher than it was at the referendum) so this also did not happen.

We were told that nobody would want to buy British, that's manifestly not the case and the PMI report seems to point out that, no, actually, it's not ""all legacy orders"" as people kept predicting but there's been actual sustained growth from manufacturing as the drop in the UK pound plus our high quality engineering has lead to those products being attractive on the *global* market.

But Tyrol is awash with German tourists, so the locals can certainly understand Hochdeutsch and speak it if they notice you don't understand them.

7) Health insurance:

A quick read of the TGKK website (https://www.tgkk.at/portal27/tgkkportal/content?contentid=10007.720002) tells me you should be able to register for a ""Selbstversicherung für Studierende (§ 16 Abs. 2 ASVG)"", which is about 57 Euro a month. I don't see anything about this only being available for Austrian or EU citizens. You just need to be living in Tyrol and be registered at university. Please somebody correct me if I'm wrong.

EDIT / PS: The uni should have a service center for foreign students or somebody who would be able to help you register for insurance, because I can't find any English info there.

&gt; # [Tribunal dice López y Ledezma violaron arresto domiciliario](https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:b05f09a0ece343a692bd07d1ce0868ba/800.jpeg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; CARACAS (AP) — El Tribunal Supremo de Justicia de Venezuela informó el martes que dos juzgados de Caracas decidieron revocar el arresto domiciliario de los opositores Leopoldo López y Antonio Ledezma tras considerar que habían violado las condiciones para cumplir sus condenas en sus viviendas.
&gt; 
&gt; Asimismo, refirió que recibió información de “inteligencia oficial” sobre un “plan de fuga” de los políticos, por lo que se activaron los procedimientos correspondientes.
&gt; 
&gt; En un escrito señaló que de acuerdo con las condiciones impuestas a López “no le permitían realizar ningún tipo de proselitismo político” y que Ledezma tenía la obligación de “abstenerse de emitir declaraciones ante cualquier medio”.
&gt; 
&gt; Las autoridades sacaron de sus casas en mitad de la noche a los líderes opositores y regresaron a López a una cárcel militar donde estuvo recluido anteriormente, en las primeras medidas del presidente Nicolás Maduro contra sus enemigos después de una criticada votación que le dio a su gobierno poderes casi ilimitados.
&gt; 
&gt; La esposa de Leopoldo López publicó en Twitter lo que parecía ser un video en el que se ve a hombres con armas largas cuando sacan a su marido de casa pasada la medianoche y lo introducen en una patrulla del Servicio Bolivariano de Inteligencia Nacional (Sebin), la policía política.
&gt; 
&gt; “Se acaban de llevar a Leopoldo de la casa. No sabemos dónde está ni adónde lo llevan”, tuiteó la esposa de López, Lilian Tintori.
&gt; 
&gt; Por su parte, los aliados del exalcalde metropolitano de Caracas difundieron en internet un video en el que agentes de la policía política se llevaban a un hombre que parecía ser el líder opositor mientras una mujer pedía a gritos ayuda de los vecinos.
&gt; 
&gt; “¡Se están llevando a Ledezma!”, exclama la mujer. “¡Dictadura!”.
&gt; 
&gt; López fue detenido en la cárcel militar de Ramo Verde, a las afueras de la capital, hace tres años tras protestas contra el gobierno de Maduro y condenado a más de 13 años de prisión por incitar la violencia de los manifestantes. Desde el 8 de julio cumplía el resto de su condena bajo arresto domiciliario. Ledezma, alcalde metropolitano de Caracas, también fue detenido en 2015 en la prisión de Ramo Verde y luego le otorgaron la medida de arresto domiciliario.
&gt; 
&gt; López, de 46 años, fue enviado nuevamente a la cárcel militar adonde ingresó cerca de las 3 de la mañana, indicó a la emisora local Éxitos el abogado del líder opositor, Juan Carlos Gutiérrez.
&gt; 
&gt; Ambos habían publicado videos recientes en internet en los que condenaban la decisión de Maduro de celebrar unas elecciones el domingo a una Asamblea Constituyente que reescriba la constitución y transforme el sistema político venezolano.
&gt; 
&gt; Gutiérrez consideró la decisión de regresar a López a la cárcel donde permaneció por tres años como una medida ""completamente arbitraria"" y sostuvo que el político siempre ""acató en su totalidad"" la sentencia del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia, que le otorgó la medida de arresto domiciliario, la cual le prohibía abandonar su casa y declarar a los medios sobre su proceso.
&gt; 
&gt; Según el abogado, se presume que Ledezma también estaría en la prisión de Ramo Verde.
&gt; 
&gt; El vicepresidente de la Asamblea Nacional, diputado opositor Freddy Guevara, indicó en su cuenta de Twitter a López lo ""secuestran"" porque ""no se quebró ante presiones y falsas promesas del régimen"".
&gt; 
&gt; Maduro dijo en la noche del lunes que no tiene ninguna intención de cambiar sus planes de redactar una nueva carta magna y perseguir a una serie de enemigos, desde canales independientes de noticias en Venezuela a hombres armados que, afirmó, habría enviado la vecina Colombia para sabotear los comicios como parte de una conspiración internacional encabezada por el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump.
&gt; 
&gt; ""No me intimidan las amenazas y sanciones del imperio, no me intimida nada en este mundo"", dijo el mandatario venezolano en un acto emitido en la televisión nacional, en el que retó a Trump a imponer más sanciones.
&gt; 
&gt; Unas horas antes, Washington había incluido a Maduro en la creciente lista de funcionarios venezolanos de alto rango afectados por sanciones financieras, subiendo la presión con una táctica que hasta ahora no ha alterado el comportamiento del gobierno socialista venezolano.
&gt; 
&gt; Por ahora, el gobierno de Trump no ha cumplido las amenazas de sanciones contra la industria petrolera venezolana, lo que podría socavar al gobierno de Maduro pero también subir los precios del combustible en Estados Unidos y agravar la crisis humanitaria en el país sudamericano.
&gt; 
&gt; Las sanciones se aprobaron después de que las autoridades en Caracas dijeran que ocho millones de personas habían votado el domingo para crear la Asamblea Constituyente, una cifra cuestionada por analistas independientes. Varios gobiernos del continente americano y Europa tacharon la consulta de ilegítima.
&gt; 
&gt; El Consejo Electoral Nacional de Venezuela dijo el domingo que la participación en los comicios había sido del 41,53%, o 8.089.320 personas. Esa cifra implicaría que el partido en el gobierno obtuvo más apoyo que en cualquier votación nacional desde 2013, a pesar del hundimiento de la economía, la inflación disparada, el desabastecimiento de medicinas y la malnutrición.
&gt; 
&gt; Sondeos de opinión indicaron que en torno de 85% de los venezolanos tenía una mala opinión de la Asamblea Constituyente y un número similar desaprobaba la gestión de Maduro.
&gt; 
&gt; Los líderes opositores estimaron que la participación real fue menos de la mitad de lo anunciado por el gobierno, en una votación supervisada por observadores de gobiernos aliados pero no por observadores electorales con reconocimiento internacional.
&gt; 
&gt; Un sondeo de salida basado en encuestas de 110 centros de votación realizado por el banco de inversiones neoyorquino Torino Capital y una empresa venezolana de opinión pública estimó que 3,6 millones de personas, en torno del 18,5% de los votantes registrados, habían acudido a las urnas.
&gt; 
&gt; En el pasado, los datos del Consejo Nacional Electoral se han considerado fiables en general, pero en este caso su estimación se vio recibida con burlas.
&gt; 
&gt; Maduro dijo que la nueva asamblea podría empezar a trabajar en una semana. Entre otras medidas, dijo que emplearía los poderes de la cámara para impedir que candidatos de la oposición se presenten a las elecciones a gobernador de diciembre, a menos que se sienten con su partido para negociar el final de unas hostilidades que han generado cuatro meses de protestas con un saldo de 121 muertos y casi 2.000 heridos.
&gt; 
&gt; Además de Estados Unidos, la Unión Europea y países como Argentina, Canadá, Colombia, México, Panamá, Paraguay, España y Gran Bretaña criticaron la votación del domingo. Maduro dijo haber recibido felicitaciones de los gobiernos de Cuba, Bolivia y Nicaragua, entre otros.

We went on our longest streak of not conceding with him in goal. Yes we had a brilliant defence too but he was part of it. Rarely made a mistake and was great at everything, especially commanding the box and defending corners.

If Poland refuses to comply with the treaties then the Article 7 suspension that the Commission wanted to pursue becomes much easier. If the Commission had difficulties with making a case against the national laws passed in Poland in regards to rule of law and undermining the democratic values contained, then the Commission has a quite easier case to make when Poland is flat out refusing to comply with a CJEU court order.

I'd argue that this wouldn't have much of an effect on Article 7 procedures, since there we're dealing with politics, not Courts.

AlcoholicAxolotl,,,"In 1956, Britain’s Daily Telegraph wanted to hear the “smack of firm government” from the meandering prime minister of the day. Anthony Eden took it to heart — and to Egypt, where his failed war for the Suez Canal ended his career and his nation’s spell as a world power. 

Still the sentiment — if not the phrase, with its ribald connotation to modern ears — survives. A divided government is held to be a bad government. A decisive one commands a Darwinian respect. “Say what you like about so and so”, we aver of long-gone prime ministers, “but you knew where you stood with them.

”No one knows where they stand with Theresa May any more. Since her own war of choice with the Labour party in June’s election she has trundled on as the ceremonial leader of a neutered government. Her Conservatives (who would laugh at that possessive) cannot agree on a model of EU exit or much of a domestic programme. They need the votes of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionists to squeak legislation through parliament. 

Into this void has come — what? If it is chaos, it is a benign version. Power has spread from the prime minister to a plurality of cabinet members, including Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Amber Rudd, the home secretary, who envisage a phased withdrawal from the EU and a post-exit Britain that remains within the mainstream of European policy. No abrupt end to free movement, no incineration of corporate tax and labour laws. Liam Fox has mustered some resistance as international trade secretary, but the cabinet tilts to Mr Hammond’s pragmatism. 

This diffusion of power to the cabinet and to the Treasury, whose technical expertise weighs more than the trade secretary’s epic visions, has wafted outwards to business, which struggled for an audience in the highest office before the election. Executives who employ people by the thousand no longer enter Downing Street braced for brusque treatment by functionaries whose career records range all the way from the media side of politics to the lobbying side of politics. 

The return of cabinet government, the re-enfranchisement of business, the likelihood of a moderated exit, the prospect of further compromises to come: this was hard to picture under Mrs May in her springtime pomp. It is her frailty that has made it all possible. 

There is a lot to be said for the caress of weak government. As long as the state itself is secure and functional, the politicians who populate its offices can be divided against each other. Better that than unity behind a bad cause or misguided prime minister. This is not a libertarian case for nihilism but a practical argument: that Britain has the least bad of all its plausible governing options.

It is an argument that can lean on precedent. Sir John Major’s Conservative government of the 1990s warred with itself for five of its seven years. It had a small majority that withered to zero. The cabinet made Mrs May’s look like migratory geese in pristine V-formation. All the while, it oversaw a sound economy, laid down much of the substance of the Northern Ireland peace accord, trialled the public-sector reforms that came to be known as Blairite and kept Britain out of the euro but inside the EU.

Sir John was a higher class of politician than Mrs May, but the principle holds: a weak government is not by definition a national problem. Through the pooling of power among a range of ministers, through the denial of decisive influence to any one set of MPs, through inaction at times, a precarious administration can fumble its way to more sensible outcomes than a leader who has what the French president Emmanuel Macron calls “Jupiterian” power.

Like the smack of firm government, Mrs May’s commitment to “strong and stable” leadership is now a line recited more in black humour than in awe. But the problem with it predates the bungled election. The slogan conflates two things that need not go together. A strong government can destabilise a nation if it does foolish things. A feeble government can provide some calm through the splitting of ideological differences and, yes, sheer inactivity. If there is such a thing as creative destruction, then there is such a thing as constructive weakness. 

For the avoidance of doubt, Britain does not have a good government. But it is better than it was when Mrs May was the force in the land, and better than it might be under strong leadership from either of the main parties.

sathyajames,,,"Some logic behind early wildcarding that isn't just 'the pros do it so it must work'

1) you can get a **better picture** of which teams are doing well and set to have decent seasons. Not a perfect one by any means but by the end of September it's clearer who's got a well rounded squad.

For example: will Spurs suffer from the Wembley effect? How are new managers like Pellegrino and De Boer looking? How is Pogba faring with Matic now? Etc etc 

2) you can easily make a new squad that includes any **deadline day signings** If some ridiculous transfer happens, like Bale to United, a wildcard is a much easier way to get him in than tinkering around with your budget, thus taking a hit or waiting weeks to shift your team to them.

Similarly, if Alexis wants to leave, but Wenger holds his nerve, he could be a much more attractive prospect after September 1st than before it. Then, in turn, players like Lacazette could become more attractive options. There's probably more examples of this with players like Barkley.

3) In September, **European Games** start to get going. When some of the big clubs start rotating players, some of your big hitters might not seem so attractive. 

4) **Fixtures Turn** for a lot of teams like Everton and Arsenal around that time. Conversely, teams like West Brom and Southampton's flip the other way. 

5) **bedding in** of new signings usually ends around this time. You might not want to get a Morata or Walker right away, because maybe players like Batshuayi and Danilo might have more of a part to play than first thought. A month or two later it could be a much more attractive prospect.

I could go on and on, but basically what I'm saying is there's a lot of reasons why GWK 4-6 is a very good time to wildcard. You don't have to agree with all of them, but it's certainly not so without reason that you can compare it to a flat tire or an abortion.

You're not the only one disappointed/upset that there was no ""hero's journey"" in trilogy-- but that's how real scientific progress is made (Einstein, Darwin, etc. all had their theories proven by OTHER people long after they're dead)... 

To my mind, viewpoint characters/ protagonists like Cheng Xin &amp; Luo Ji who strayed/stayed beyond their expertise are indicative of all the problems that hero worship (aka the fallacy of ""generalized"" Authority) can cause-- which is why I loved the fact that Liu didn't do any Joseph Campbell-like nonsense (""The Hero with A Thousand Faces"" refers to the creation of mythic figures by amalgamation of archetypes-- they don't realistically exist, except in a very mundane way)

The failings and, even worse, insignificance of humanity, is a quality you'll find in more Eastern European (Asian?) sci-fi-- e.g. Stanislaw Lem and the Strugatsky brothers typically sustain a narrative/ novel purely on the ""through-line"" of a theme/ thought experiment... to quote Liu, they just seem more aware of the ""gravity of reality"".


""I find it a bit frustrating the fact that the countdown played such a bug role on the character development at book one simply to be dropped as the rest of the story developed.

Are you mis-remembering something? Cos there's no more point to the countdown or any other scare-tactics after it was discovered that the ETO/ sophons/ Trisolaris was behind the scientists' suicides.... of course, humanity had all of its nihilism to deal with-- now that they are stuck ""sharpening their spears"" instead of progressing on to quantum computing (&amp; possibly ""sentient"" AI).

These food industries will go elsewhere, I am sure with Brexit it is more likely we will see these jobs go. Whilst I agree that there are a lot of foreign workers in jobs employment is at the highest level it has been so British people are still working being paid. I also cannot pull any statistics out the bag but I would imagine that there are a higher proportion of British people occupying professional roles thus the shift to lower paid jobs with more foreign workers. 

Ideology - Is this not natural with a more globalised world with trade deals. You can get from New York to London in less than a days work (7h.30m) which would have taken weeks previously. Whilst I can feel it is isolating it is the world we are going to continue living in whether we like or embrace it or not. 

Free Movement - We do this has been proven time and again statistically for a variety of sectors and jobs. If you wish to not accept this then this is down to your understanding and nothing I will say will help this. Yes English is the only language most Brits know however most countries like native speakers and can easily find a job in other European countries because everyone speaks English - difference is most Brits wouldn't go to German to work in a factory.

I'm center left and only slightly left libertarian (but sympathize with anarchists, etc.)

meet me half way and start waking people up
that right wing politicians have always failed the people because it serves the establishment (even conservativism is anti-worker, let alone NEOconservatives)
especially as they both tend to be extremely authoritarian.
Also like to note that moderate right wing American politicians are not as moderate as they claim
because A) anyone can claim to be moderate (some think that being in between dem and repub
= moderate....which couldn't be further from the truth) and B) America's spectrum is right wing shifted literally.

I absolutely agree with you,
everyone who isn't an insane authoritarian ass kisser can come on board.
Moderate libertarians I can tolerate fine, but the extreme type
like Gary Johnson, Ron/Rand Paul, Laissez-faire bullshit, extreme right wing etc.
isn't compatible because these people haven't explored enought
to know it's a trap, a ""liberty for the corps"" type trap.
I think Rothschild banker, France's Macron, is just a little left
of Gary Johnson.....shit. Lol. 

I know the political spectrum isn't a water tight concept
and sometimes inaccuracies pop up,
as well as the U.S. being right wing-shifted (what's center left in the U.S. is centerist in Europe
so we in the U.S. obviously fkd up big time lol)
but as rough understanding, this seems like a reasonable alliance maybe:

I just made sure I got rid of the extreme authoritarians and extreme right wingers.
(I feel that extreme left wingers can more easily be put a notch down or two
than extreme right wingers....but I might be biased....either way, they're more compatible with
progressivism and likely open minded)

I know it's a very simplified view, but the image
sort of omits the most dangerous of maniacs and brainwashed people
at least, which would make it a lot easier to agree on a centrist candidate.

to start somewhere!!! lol)

&gt;Constantine made it the official religion of the Roman Empire in roughly...the 3rd century AD? Still, 1700 years is a good track record.
You're right, but the first Christians in Europe existed in the first century AD.

&gt;Historians believe that St. Paul probably wrote his first epistle to the Christians of Thessaloniki (Thessalonians) around AD 52.[7] His Epistle to the Galatians was perhaps written even earlier, between AD 48 and 50.[8] Other epistles written by Paul were directed to Christians living in Greece (1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Philemon, Philippians, 2 Thessalonians) and Rome (Romans) between the 50s and 70s of the first century.
&gt;The Record of Saint Dorotheus Bishop of Tyre is that the Church at Tyre sent Saint Aristobulus (of the seventy) to Britain as bishop in AD 37.

holiday1021,4,,"I simply don't understand. I don't understand how Pablo letting fans have their way in other media somehow shits in your cornflakes. Pablo isn't going to use forms in the movies. They have never been used in the movies before, and unless someone other than Pablo takes over in the future, they will never be used.

It's not about retconning, not at all. It's about staying true to the vision of the series. You keep going back to an EU thing that was always a theory and nothing more, acting as if Pablo is doing a dis-service somehow by ignoring it.

Every retcon example you gave can be explained. But that's not the point here, the point is that it needs to be explained, why? Because the movies/books/games/shows all have different writers who use their take on the mythos. There has to be some way to connect it all or you just have a lump of contradiction and no one will be able to make sense of what is and isn't canon.

The entire reason Disney dropped the majority (if not all) of the EU books is because they're trying to fix this very thing, the very thing you're upset with. To make one unifying explanation and narrative for everything.

Face it, Lucas screwed up big time. He had one vision, but he allowed others to do as they wish. Canon was only what was seen in the movies. Everything else from games to books was open for debate. Darth Vader was always to be menacing but ultimately a gimp when fighting, I'm sorry to say. Lucas' vision had him immobile, he lost half of his body. So instead of flashy techniques with the saber, he uses slow, strong attacks aided by the force. 

Yet in comics and books Vader is seen dancing around the battlefield like Darth Maul which was never to be the case. Yet Lucas cared not, ""Do what you want to do."" slogan was the saying of the day. But in the end, if you saw something on the screen in a movie, THAT was fact and THAT was canon.

So now we have people believing Vader to be this gymnast because of lack of direction concerning the characters and Lucas let it all happen.

Lightsaber forms were never a thing. Ever. It was picked up by wirters and made a thing out of fan theory. Although Lucasfilm today acknowledges it, it's up to the directors of the films and their creative freedom whether they allow it or not.

Rebels quoting the saber form was nothing more than fan service about a theory, and it should be treated as much. An easter egg, if you will. You're always going to find contradictions, anywhere you look.

None of this has anything to do with Pablo caring - his main job is to oversee continuity on the films amongst many other duties. All he is saying is, you may see it in Rebels, or books, where the forms are concerned, but don't expect to see it in the movies.

We don't know what's happening over there. They may still be undecided if they want to officially make forms canon or not. Rebels and EU books used them. Rebels is canon.

I'd be willing to bet that Finland relies a lot more, especially now, on their European and Scandinavian allies as opposed to US forces. Do you know how many military bases we have in Finland? 0. The largest US military presence in Finland is at the US embassy, and that's meant to protect that building, and that's about it. Now back to the main point - If you want to make a thread comparing Russia and the US - go ahead, who's stopping you?

evil_jew,,,"&gt; Why? Just because he was precocious in mathematics doesn't make him a political genius or some kind of universal savant. And it certainly doesn't excuse the fact that he deliberately murdered people to achieve his personal goals. It's like saying you can forgive a serial rapist because he's really good looking.

Wow, I was right, you fundamentally DON'T understand Ted. Precocious mathematician is an understatement. Let's go over the reasons real quick on why he is undeniably a genius.

* Graduated high school and started Harvard at 16

* Received his doctorate at 25 then immediately went on to become the youngest professor that the University of Berkeley had ever hired

* His doctoral thesis is highly praised with such statements as ""the best I have ever directed"" and ""I would guess that maybe 10 or 12 men in the country understood or appreciated it"" being made about it/him

* His made-from-scratch bombs are testament to his skill at engineering. Especially since most of them were made from shit he had lying around his cabin in the woods

* And one of my favorite's; he was able to evade law enforcement detection for 17 years and succeeded in strong-arming the country into publishing his manifesto. You try committing any major crime and getting away with it for 17 years and see how far you get.

There are many more reasons, but I just want to touch up on those big ones. I don't know if you're jealous of Ted or what, but he most certainly was a fucking genius. The fact that he killed people means little to me, I'm a firm believer in ""the ends justify the means"" philosophy.


Let's move on:

&gt; The Industrial Revolution is just an artificial line in history. Kaczynski was referring to industrialization (which is a process) and the social stratification (division of labor) that comes along with it. He argues we have lost our own self-reliance to specialization. The Industrial Revolution and world economy have only accelerated this trend, but it is not the cause of it.

Got to give you credit u/Azdahak, you are really good at splitting hairs and changing goal posts. Mind explaining what you mean by ""artificial line in history"" a little better instead of just expecting that vague opinion to have any weight? How is that ""artificial line"" any different than the Protestant Reformation, the Renaissance, or any other ""artificial line in history"". Once again you're trying to undermine something to fit your narrative.


&gt; That all depends on your time scale. Over the course of human history civilizations have risen and fallen, but the overall trajectory has been progressive in the sense that we have continued to enrich ourselves even if the primary arbiters of that progression have changed.
Simply put, we live in the easiest, most peaceful, qualitatively best time in history for the majority of people who are alive. While there are still many people who suffer, the past was almost always worse for everyone. Some tribesmen in a remote African village who sees a doctor once a year has better health care than anyone who was alive 100 years ago.

This is conjecture. There are all kinds of arguments against post-industrial revolution being the most peaceful and easy time period of history. How many genocides have happened in the last hundred years? 50 million people died in WWII alone. Add WWI, Vietnam, and all the regional conflicts all over the world in there, and the future doesn't look so bright. Inside your little Western sphere maybe, but 99% world has an abysmal standard of living. At least the peasants of the old world could be self sufficient and rely on the land for survival. If you live in a ghetto project on the South side of Chicago or South central LA, you're options are very limited. Lol Chicago had 700+ shootings last year. Which is a lot, but not compared to Bogota, or Rio, or Moscow. 

&gt; Because pessimism is the path of least resistance to use Kaczynski's terminology. It's the easiest thing to do because its admitting that nothing can be done and hence relieving yourself of the effort of trying.

Pessimism in the face of REAL problems that affect 99% of the world is called being realistic. Naively looking at the world through rose-tinted glasses because you've never had to really face anything outside of your little bubble is taking the path of least resistance. 


&gt; There is no such thing as ""equilibrium"".

Bullshit. Here, have a link from Ted's own Berkeley to educate you http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/cur/programming/simulation/ecosystem-simulation.html

I understand you're a mathematician and not a naturalist, so I'll overlook the absurdity of your statement, for now.


&gt; But what we have today that we had in no other time in history are things like nature preserves, national parks, nationally managed fisheries and forests, and professionals who constantly monitor the state of the environment and try to manage our use of it. The results of those practices are quiet evident when you compare treeless Europe to N. America.

The way you interpret the finding is as follows: ""Given what we know today, and what we think will happen in the future, the currency seems to be in more demand than it should be according to this model which is based on 21 variables that have historically proven to have a material role in determining exchange rates""

I should also point out they found sterling was overvalued by 5%-10%, assuming nothing changed in the UK economy. Brexit of course is not the status quo and the assumptions for every single one of the 21 variables will have changed now. Most will get worse, particularly #'s 1, 5, 9 , 17, 18, 21.

The correct way to take the IMF assessment (to me) is that if times were 'normal', sterling would have fallen by 5%-10%, with brexit the fall was deeper.

As to what lead to its overvaluation I am probably more correct than not to point at the positive yield on gilts (rare in europe).


the list:

1. NFA/Y (net foreign assets to GDP ratio).
1. Financial center dummy. Dummy variable
1. Output/worker, relative to top 3 economies. Ratio of PPP GDP to working age population relative to average of Germany, Japan, and U.S.
1. Oil and gas trade balance, adjusted for ‘temporariness.’ Exports minus imports of of oil and natural gas as percentage of GDP. Temporariness is the ratio of current extraction to proven reserves from the BP Statistical Review to (i.e. the inverse of ‘years-till-exhaustion’) divided by the same ratio for Norway’s oil in 2010.
1. Population growth.
1. Old age dependency ratio. Ratio of population aged 65+ divided by population 30-64
1. Aging speed. Projected change in the dependency ratio (above), ratio 20 years out
1. 5-year growth forecast. WEO projections of the rate of real GDP growth 5 years ahead.
1. Public health spending/GDP. A proxy for one type of social protection policy, which tends to reduce private agents’ need for precautionary saving.
1. VIX/VXO, interpreted as a measure of global risk aversion. 
1. Own currency share in world reserves, as a proxy for the “exorbitant privilege.” Varies somewhat over time. For example, 73 percent for the US in 1985, down to 61 percent in 2010. For a country such as Greece, it moves from zero in 1998 to 19 percent in 2001 (when it joined the euro). For Germany, the change between 1998 and 2001 is less dramatic (from 14 percent to 19 percent). 
1. Output gap. 
1. Commodity terms of trade gap. This regressor aims to capture the role of cyclical commodity prices' influence on a country’s overall terms of trade
1. Commodity terms of trade (in the REER regression). ratio of a geometric weighted average price of the main commodity exports to a geometric weighted average price of the main commodity imports 
1. Cyclically-adjusted fiscal balance.
1. Capital controls index on overall capital controls on the private sector. 0 (no controls) to 1 (full control).
1. Changes in reserves, instrumented. Change in central bank foreign exchange reserves during the year scaled by nominal GDP, both in U.S. dollars. Instrumented via M2/GDP, U.S. interest rates, and global reserve accumulation, with country specific slopes, in order to account for various reserve accumulation motives (the first stage regression also controls for the independent regressors of the respective CA or REER regression).
1. Real interest rate. Nominal short-term interest rate minus annual inflation rate. 
1. Safer institutional/political environment. This variable is the average of: socioeconomic conditions; investment profile; corruption religious tensions; and democratic accountability. 
1. Trade openness. Average ratio of exports and imports to GDP.

Tu es prof titulaire du coup maintenant ? 

&gt; Pour le recrutement, c'est propre à chaque Académie, mais ça doit être assez similaire partout. Il y a un formulaire web, c'est assez simple si je me rappelle bien.

&gt; C'est une expérience intéressante, mais faut pas avoir trop d'attentes quant aux résultats. Les élèves sont rarement « méchants », ce n'est pas pour ça qu'ils vont t'écouter et travailler. Il faut autant que possible échanger et discuter avec les autres profs, quitte à parfois forcer un peu la main à certains.

Surtout que je suppose qu'il est difficile d'avoir un vrai suivi si l'on ne fait que des remplacements.

&gt; J'imagine que ça aide d'avoir été moniteur de colo avant de commencer, ou au moins de fréquenter et connaître des enfants/adolescents.

&gt; Mercedes-Benz banned a construction subcontractor from its plant in Vance, Alabama, after an CBS News investigation found that foreign workers had obtained visas on the basis of roles substantially different from those they ended up occupying.

&gt; Former workers confirmed to CBS News that the practice had been apparent since 2013, and a CBS News investigation has found that it continues to this day.

&gt; The CBS News team spent four months tracking more than 200 Eastern Europeans building U.S. auto factories, traveling to Croatia to meet one former worker who spent time working in construction at an automaker&amp;#039;s plant in the U.S. The full report aired on July 31 on both the CBS Television Network and CBSN during the premiere of &amp;quot;CBSN: On Assignment.""

DieRedditDie0oo0,,,"Well, I will put it this way; The refugees aren't cowards either. 

Why are 90% of ""refugees"" fighting aged men? Who is protecting their women and children? Why do they feel confident enough to leave their women and children alone and that they will be safe in Syria while they ""flee"" to Europe or America? The answer is that Muslim women and children don't need protection because no one is targeting them. They aren't in any danger. Assad's Alawite and Christian army doesn't pose a threat to women and children. They don't target them. The ""gas attacks"" were actually committed by Islamic Terrorists on their own people to get America to attack Assad. If refugees were legitimate, they would be 90% women and children, not the other way around and NO ONE would have a problem with helping them.

Only the Sunni Islamic Terrorists kill or enslave non-Muslim women and children and Sunni men are the vast majority (90%+) of the refugees coming to Europe. Only Islam allows for the killing of Kuffar (non-Muslim) women and children. It is actually ordered in the Quran by Allah. Islam advocates women and children being killed or  enslaved as a weapon of war. It's in the Quran and Muhammad did it in his own life as written in the Hadiths. Muhammad enslaved and killed entire villages of non-Muslims. 

Fortunately, the Jewish Syrians have all gotten out. The Christians and Yazidis are the only real refugees. Their women and children are in real danger, but the Muslims use the ignorance of the West to prevent their escape while pretending to be refugees themselves. There are UN run refugee camps that non-Muslims will be killed in if they flee there. Muslim refugees throw non-Muslim refugees off boats in the Mediterranean before landing in European claiming refugee status.  Non-Muslim are undergoing a genocide right now across the Middle East and Persia right now, the Western World is helping it happen, and main stream media refuses to report on it.

A study in Sweden proved that over 80% of ""child"" refugees were actually adult men. Why is that happening? It's because they aren't refugees. They are invaders. Muslims aren't in Europe to become European. Muslims are in Europe to make Europe Muslim. They are just using the system to destroy non-Muslims wherever they find them. They just don't have the power right now to attack the West except in small Terror Attacks. They will attack when they have a very good chance of victory. In the meantime, they burden the Kuffar and attack at the core of their fertility by attacking women and children in the West. By targeting women in non-Muslim nations they seek to ""win a womb for Allah"" and ""deny one to the Kuffar"". That is why it is forbidden for non-Muslim men to marry Muslim women. The children won't be Muslim. While Muslim men can take many non-Muslim slaves so all the children will be Muslim. Thus spreading Islam.

I know beyond a shadow of doubt that they are just parasites and invaders. They aren't worried that government forces in Syria will harm their women and children. They know they are safe. Many ISIS fighters put their families in UN refugee centers to keep them safe from reprisals while they go kill Christian and Yazidi women and children. Then they use the Wests generosity to flee to Europe or America when they lose on the battlefield. They can then use the money and resources of the West to resupply Islamic Terrorist back home.

This is what many Syrian Christians tell me. They tell me how the Terrorists use our system against them. That is why Christianity is dying in there and why Pagan Persians like the Yazidis are almost completely wiped from the earth. That land was Christian and Pagan for millennia. It's future is 100% Muslim.

&gt;Also: What's stopping you from joining Assad right now? Why not just stay in Syria after you won that glorious war you endorse?

I am not Syrian. It isn't my culture and I wouldn't be allowed there anyway.

Now having said all that, you will no doubt report me for hate speech because simply telling anyone about these crimes that are taking place, I put myself at risk of reprisal from Muslims and my own government. Well, because I am afraid of the consequences of speaking freely I should note here that I am criticizing only ISIS Terrorists and not peaceful Muslims who are not a part of these practices.",True,False,,0,1501607747,,1501609706,0,dl0qpkt,False,t3_6q29hm,t1_dkxxcxl,1503674209,1,False,nottheonion,t5_2qnts,

det är mer att... alltså vad jag försöker säga är att jag tror det hela kan gå bra om dom invandrade känner sig välkomna. Vi behöver reagera på nåt sätt på situationen som är. Jag tror det är bättre att vi väljer morötter än piskor, och jag tror att risken är att piskor är vad vi får om vi ger efter för oron. Det finns antagligen ingen riskfri framtid att välja. Jag tror definitivt att vi valt den politik vi valt för att få något tillbaka. Det vore fint om politikerna nån gång kunde va öppna med varför massinvandring var bra för Sverige, för jag tror det finns nåt argument, men att dom inte kan dra det för då medger dom att det var en transaktion, att man sålde ut vissa saker (som till exempel att en massa våldtäkter begås) mot nåt annat. Det ser bättre ut om man försöker framställa sig som god medmänniska. Men jag tror i vilket fall att det finns dimensioner i det här som sällan eller aldrig kommer upp. Kanske långsiktiga ekonomiska (jag vet att många tror att det hela bara kommer bli en kostnad, men över lång tid är jag inte övertygad om det).




&gt;Det resonemanget kommer du aldrig kunna sälja till mig och många andra dock.



det var inte menat som en ursäkt, snarare en möjlig förklaring. Sen kan man känna sympati eller inte. Jag minns ärligt talat inte hur bevisningen ser ut gällande vilka som kommit som är och inte är flyktingar. Jag får kolla upp det. Det finns mycket som går att ifrågasätta men frågan är hur mycket som går att veta. Jag är i vilket fall rätt säker på att EU borde stänga båtvägen helt, men annars är jag inte 100.




Av länderna du nämner tror jag man kan säga att Somalia, Afghanistan, Eritrea och kanske delar av Libyen är miserabla nog för att flykt skulle va ett rimligt begrepp. Bara Eritrea kan sägas inte befinna sig i nån sorts krig, men Eritrea är så jäkla förtryckt internt. Marocko har möjligen Väst Sahara som ursäkt men det låter klent imo.




&gt;Det är inte det värsta, det värsta är att religionen förbjuder följarna från att värdera landets lagar över Sharia. Kvinnosynen och synen på homosexualla och minoriteter. Nolltoleransen mot apostasi. Det faktum att den perfekte muslimen som alla ska eftersträva att vara som var en pedofil och krigsherre med ett halvt dussin fruar.

The primary merits of a particular strategy relate to its likelihood of success, and a war strategy can be measured by its ability to help achieve the end goal.   Assuming you consult with your military prior to starting a war, you may want to see if your goals are achievable to them.  Assuming you end up in a war, you should check regularly to see if your strategy is actually working.

The German military is a good case in point of the contrast between operational brilliance and strategic idiocy.  The sickle cut in France was a bold plan that succeeded beyond any reasonable expectation, but even conquering western Europe did not dramatically improve Germany's economic weaknesses.  Barbarossa was predicated on total victory in 6 to 8 weeks.  By November of 1941, any sane analyst would conclude that the chances of military victory of any kind were impossible.  Continuing to plan operations that were increasingly unlikely to alter this fact simply meant prolonging the conflict until Germany suffered total defeat.

DjonkeC,,,"Hello all,

Thank you for taking the time to look at this post. **I will need your expertise.**

I will be attending a *Youth Activism Meeting* soon and would like to address men's issues and see if they offer a platform for men's issues within the so-called progressive community as nothing on the timetable would suggest so. (I was invited through an activist organization whose main goals are to help suppress discrimination, which is great - but I haven't seen any mentions of men's issues anywhere and it bothered me)

The main ideas and goals of mine will be to establish a tunnel for communication and understanding, where we can discuss men's issues with the same gravitas as any other group gets.

As men's issues are often disregarded and marginalized I believe I'll run into resistance and misunderstanding. I am completely prepared for dealing with tantrums and/or anything that might happen once I have the attention of everyone.

I don't believe I will receive overwhelming resistance as this is, after all, a *seminar about non-discrimination*, but you never know what to expect.

I will ask my girlfriend to film the event and the discussions I'll bring to the table, so we might have interesting material to look at after the event is through.

The main topics I'd like to discuss would be the actual tangible and provable statistics that indicate the difficulties men face:
 
*  Suicide rates
*  Numbers of college graduates
*  Custody, child care
*  Job market opportunities


I have read a number of articles and seen a lot of videos, but haven't researched the actual numbers and studies behind them.

I went through the FAQ and found some interesting articles, so that's going to be my starting point.

Please let me know if you have anything that you'd like me to discuss with the *progressive community* other than the issues listed above.

**Also, please offer any citations, academic work or real life experiences I can use to build the strongest possible case for men's issues.**


I'd like to say that I have no problem with public speaking or with being scrutinized, so every input will be taken into consideration.

Picture posted is the itinerary which contains, as you can see, nothing for men's issues.


Please let me know what you believe are the most important topics to discuss and any citations or empirical evidence I can provide the '**opposition**' with.

As I am moving to another EU country this year, I will definitely be an active member of whichever MR organization is the most impartial and fair, but until then I am busy with work and there's just no time for me to start something here.

&gt;So lets start by noting that the Chelsea academy that most Chelsea fans refer to only fully opened in 2008 at the new centre, so has only been fully open for less than 10 years, and any kids that joined it at the age of 8 would only be around 17-18 years old. I stipulate this early because obviously that means there's not going to be a lot of 28 year old in their prime players from this academy as is simply didn't exist when those players were growing up. 

Ahh, the City excuse. Did your academy not exist before 2008? Was the number of graduates before that a total of zero? Even forgetting that, you're pretty much just accepting that you haven't really had any youngsters who've graduated recently be ""your own"". 

&gt;There's already been the sales of Ake (22), Chalobah (22) and Solanke (19) to Premier League teams, two of which should be starters, as well as the loans of Palmer (20), Loftus-Cheek (21), Izzy Brown (20) and Abraham (19) to Premier League club. Of those seven players six out of seven are English and four of them have been with Chelsea their entire youth career as well rather than being brought in from other clubs academies at 16 (Abraham, Solanke, Chalobah and Loftus-Cheek).

Being English doesn't change anything. 4 being Chelsea players from the start is pretty much what the original comment suggested anyway. Forgetting that, your ""youngsters"" supposedly play all across Europe, so please elaborate on how many of them also fit into your criteria. 



&gt;Then we can go look at the England youth squads that were so successful this summer:
. 

You can claim them as a success when they actually have a playing career. 


&gt;Then we can look at the FA Youth Cup Final where Chelsea beat Man City 5-1:

I'm honestly not surprised. You and City pretty much solely have this drum about winning youth trophies to bang on. Obviously you don't know or realize that youth trophies don't matter even a little. Claim them to be a success when they're playing. 


&gt;So it's not hard to see why someone might call you uneducated about the Chelsea youth set up when you come out with lines about how all they do is buy 16 year olds, loan them out, and then take the credit. Sure Chelsea bring in some players at that age level, like all clubs do, but the talent they are producing themselves is some of the best in England.  

Your definition of a good and successful academy is much different than what it actually is, not to mention you've completely glossed over the fact that despite all your points the vast majority of the ""loan army"" and the *technically* Chelsea graduates weren't even a part of the youth setup, forget about atleast some of them being successful.

This was not the case in previous expansions when shit actually killed you if you didn't react appropriately.

Sadly by the time Cata hit, heroic dungeons got nerfed so hard after the first week because ""oh em gee blizzurd i keep dying to something that is really avoidable, pls nerf or u will lose my sub hurr durr"". Since then its been more or less easy mode unless you push beyond the gold 'ol dungeon/raid finder.

I don't enjoy this because:

a) it makes finding good players really hard, especially if a lot of the new players arent used to actually using their abilities to benefit the group as a whole

b) it makes for poor gameplay overall. Yes, its fun getting epics out of a lootdummy once or twice, but it gets boring reaaaal quick.

c)all everyone ever fucking talks about on this sub is how good vanilla, tbc and wotlk was. Well guess what - some of that content was real hard.

icy_tease,,,"As long as you're willing to do some [home]work, you can greatly reduce the chance of a player lashing out at you (whether he was correct or not).  Absolute best raiding resource is from the hardcore guild qT, which you may have heard of  http://qtfy.eu  . Using that site as a starting point, follow these rules:  
1. Gear your class (specific build).  This includes food and utility.  Ask a friend for advice if you're just starting out (to fit your style).  A great all-around choice is condi ranger, effective at basically 11 out of 13 bosses.  Magi druid (geared from some AC dungeon grinding) could be another first choice.  Zerker engi or staff daredevil are a few other simpler dps classes.  Can consult the qT table for an idea of boss effectiveness, but again, talk to an experienced raider if you have questions like, ""why not condi mesmer for boss X?""  
2. Know your class/build (super important!).  The resources can be found on that same site.  Click on their provided youtube video rotations, slow them down to 0.25 speed if you have to, consult written rotation.  Practice at Special Forces training golem.  Use panel to add proper realistic buffs to yourself (i think these are spelled out in qT's benchmarks page).  Summon a golem and give it all condis.  Perhaps practice first without food, then maybe with cheaper secondary food, then some trials with actual raid food.  At this point you may realize that you could rebind your keys for convenience, which could eventually help you.  
3. Know your boss.  Ofc some of this comes with experience, like unexpected boss move interrupts your rotation.  The idea here is to read/watch some guides on boss mechanics, and afterwards you can also try searching yt for specific class points of view, like ""gorseval, ele POV"".  
My guild does some internal training runs.  People who don't do #2 or #3 at all are just asking for a carry.

Because only aboriginals can meet their comeuppance through overweening pride? Come on man, there are whole genres of western fiction dedicated to the evils of pride.  

&gt;But Trudeau must have known that he'd win, and win easily. He was taller, fitter, and knew that Brazeau wasn't a boxer. Brazeau was huffing and puffing from the first punch and Trudeau basically humiliated him in the second and third round.

Absolutely.  I doubt he would have done it if he hadn't thought he was going to win.  But same thing for Brazeau.  They were two adult men who both voluntarily agreed to a friendly boxing match, both fulling expecting they would easily win and get to shave the other person's head.  One of them was bound to be right, and like I said, had Trudeau lost I wouldn't be here talking about how the big native beating up the white European and then shaving his head is just a barbaric callback to scalping.

This is only about colonialism insofar as you're determined to *make* it about colonialism.  Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, and sometimes two politicians boxing is *just two politicians boxing*.

- Rovinj in Croatia is gorgeous, albeit a bit small for multiple days, probably okay as a day-trip.

- Close by, Pula has a nice Roman colosseum and lots of history behind it if you're into that sort of thing. 

- Split has a surprisingly nice old town, and you can take plenty of day-trips to both Krka NP and Plitvice Lakes, in addition to the many islands nearby. The city is the second biggest city in Croatia, though.

- Perast in Montenegro is a short trip north from Kotor. Both cities (or, Perast is a seaside town, really) are lovely. Definitely a highlight of my trip. The fjord is amazing, and if you go, you should definitely walk up Kotor fortress to get a fantastic view of the water.

- Prizren in Kosovo was quite interesting and Ottoman-esque, especially compared to Pristina. The old quarter is so charming to walk around in. 

- Ohrid in Macedonia is a bit on the bigger side, maybe, but it is the number one thing to visit in the country for a reason. The lake is very peaceful. 

- Finally, Bitola is the second biggest city in Macedonia, and has a cool European vibe, definitely worth a quick stop if you're in the area.

Also, I can recommend Gdansk in Poland. It's a Hanseatic city on the north coast, having been passed around between nearby powers for centuries.

Piran in Slovenia is also really cool. It's one of the few settlements on the Slovenian coast, and is situated on a narrow peninsula. Definitely worth it to stay a night. ",True,False,,0,1501610793,,1501611092,0,dl0tqwq,False,t3_6qxrsd,t3_6qxrsd,1503675711,11,False,solotravel,t5_2rxxm,

Yes, ""investing"" is the right word to use. I'm 35, obviously without a family.. But I want to experience life and see the world. I think working in a job I don't care about until retirement it a huge sacrifice of the little time I have. Life is short, may as well do something cool with it.

So far in almost two months I've slept every night in a tent and only one of them was on a camping ground. I sleep very well in my sleeping bag and love wild camping. In some countries I'll probably need to rent cabins or hotel rooms, but in Scandinavia there's so much free nature that I'm happier outside.

Winter - trying to get to warmer countries. Hopefully will be in South France before it gets cold.

Route is pretty uncertain, but the plan is one year in Europe, second year in Asia, then Australia, South America, and North America. A possible sixth year in Africa, if I still feel like cycling by that point.

Some longer (up to one month) stops may be necessary at some point to recover from strains or injuries, or just rest in general. But mostly the aim is to be on the road. Five years is too long to plan though, so I'll just see what happens.

I'll support myself through time-lapse, and maybe regular photography. It's not really work though, since I would shoot photos and time-lapses even for fun.

&gt;   
&gt; La historia muestra que en la Argentina no hay líder derrotado que no pueda volver a triunfar en la coyuntura adecuada
&gt; 
&gt; [Federico Andahazi](http://bucket1.glanacion.com/anexos/fotos/99/2249999w180.png ""Federico Andahazi"")
&gt; 
&gt; Martes 01 de agosto de 2017
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hay que entender la lógica de las próximas elecciones en la Argentina a la luz de lo que está sucediendo en el continente. Existe un ambicioso plan de fuga hacia adelante encabezado por Nicolás Maduro y los líderes del eje bolivariano extendido. El régimen venezolano, que hoy se muestra como un furioso animal herido de muerte, no parece tener porvenir. Si Maduro cayera derrotado en las elecciones que decidió reemplazar por una aberración jurídica, lo esperaría un futuro tras las rejas. Ningún líder quisiera verse reflejado en ese espejo. Van a defender el régimen a cualquier precio.
&gt; 
&gt; Con el aporte del PC cubano; del flamante presidente ecuatoriano, Lenín Moreno; de Álvaro García Linera, vicepresidente de Bolivia; de sectores del PT acorralados por la justicia, y del kirchnerismo, surgió un imaginativo plan de contraofensiva contra el imperialismo neoliberal. De acuerdo con los viejos postulados de José Carlos Mariátegui, se trataría de establecer una alianza de los trabajadores con los pueblos originarios de América del Sur, especialmente en las zonas andinas y selváticas. Impulsarían así un polo incaico-marxista en la región para abandonar toda frivolidad republicana, que conciben como una rémora del viejo colonialismo español, reencarnado hoy en Estados Unidos. Ése fue el exitoso plan de Evo Morales y de Correa y es la cuerda sobre la cual quiere hacer pie Maduro. Conforme con este programa continental, hoy [Milagro Sala](/milagro-sala-t48768 ""Ver todas las notas de Milagro Sala"") contaría no sólo con el aval de los dirigentes regionales más rebeldes y los rosarios papales, sino también con sus pergaminos de líder de los pueblos originarios. Esta caracterización es la que compró la CIDH al pedir su excarcelación, conmovida por la figura de una presa política morena, ""pobre"" y segregada.
&gt; 
&gt; La consigna ""Liberen a Milagro"" sería la punta de lanza del plan que consistiría en una suerte de 17 de Octubre continental, una pueblada en todas las capitales de América latina que muestre la vitalidad de la Revolución, con la presencia en un acto multitudinario de Evo Morales, Lenín Moreno, Correa, Lula, Raúl Castro, Daniel Ortega y Cristina Kirchner, quien ""abdicaría"" públicamente a favor de Milagro para facilitarle la llegada al poder en 2019. O antes. Con elecciones o sin ellas. Como en Venezuela. La carta al pueblo venezolano que acaba de redactar Sala sería el manifiesto de este nuevo movimiento.
&gt; 
&gt; No corra, querido lector. Esta idea delirante no tiene ningún viso de realidad. Es sólo la fabulación de un escritor para demostrar que hasta la ocurrencia más absurda puede ser verosímil en este país. De hecho, no es del todo original. Está compuesta por retazos de la historia y noticias del presente. La idea del restablecimiento de un imperio incaico fue sostenida por José de San Martín y Manuel Belgrano. Tan variados, lábiles e impredecibles eran los proyectos que antes de imaginar un emperador inca Belgrano y Rivadavia habían viajado a Inglaterra para buscar un rey europeo que gobernara nuestro país. A la luz de estos hechos, la idea anterior no parece descabellada. La política argentina siempre fue imprevisible: el mismo Rivadavia que salió en busca de un monarca terminó siendo el primer presidente de una república.
&gt; 
&gt; El futuro es un enigma. En estos días de encuestas, pronósticos que varían minuto a minuto, apuestas de inversores, empresarios que se comen las uñas, analistas que quieren explicarle a la opinión pública lo que ellos mismos ignoran, en medio de esta incertidumbre general, el Gobierno no colabora con la previsibilidad. Cometió el imperdonable error de colocar a Cristina en el centro de la escena. Hoy nadie piensa en Esteban Bullrich (de hecho, muy pocos saben quién es) ni en Massa ni en Randazzo ni en los cientos de candidatos que se presentan en estas PASO. Todos se concentran en Cristina. Se vota por ella o en contra de ella. Lo consiguió una vez más.
&gt; 
&gt; Tal vez para morigerar la angustia, muchos quieren convencerse de que Cristina está en las mismas condiciones que Carlos Menem antes de que el riojano desertara de la segunda vuelta contra Néstor Kirchner en 2003. Es posible. Pero quién se atrevería a afirmar que la historia se repetirá de la misma exacta manera. Hay que atravesar tres eternidades para develar ese misterio: la que nos separa de las elecciones primarias, luego, las legislativas y, por último, muy lejos, las generales de 2019. ¿Habrá que vivir hasta entonces con el corazón en la boca? No es vida. Nadie eligió este calvario. Durán Barba quiso ocultar la herencia para darnos unos meses de felicidad y nos dejó cuatro años de zozobra.
&gt; 
&gt; La mayoría de los presidentes argentinos no parecían destinados a serlo. Perón era un militar que no sólo carecía de los títulos para ser presidente: no tenía abolengo siquiera para llegar a ser oficial. Por sus venas corría sangre india, su padre no lo reconoció y su madre era soltera en la época en la que los oficiales del ejército debían tener sangre azul y paladar negro. Perón volvió de la muerte política una y otra vez. La primera vez que lo dieron por muerto fue cuando lo encarcelaron en la isla Martín García. Desde el 17 de octubre de 1945 jamás dejó de resucitar, aun sepultado. Paradojas de la historia: Perón nació a la política escoltando al general Uriburu en el estribo del auto con el que llegó a la Casa Rosada, mediante el derrocamiento de un presidente constitucional. Fue uno de los cerebros del GOU, artífice del golpe militar de 1943, y vicepresidente de facto. Pero nada impidió que pudiera participar en elecciones libres. Ventajas que otorga la democracia, incluso a los que no creen en ella.
&gt; 
&gt; Tal vez la presidente menos esperada de la historia haya sido María Estela Martínez de Perón. Ignota bailarina exótica en la compañía de Joe Herald en un cabaret de Panamá, aficionada al espiritismo, carente de cualquier interés en la política, el azar la puso en la fórmula presidencial Perón-Perón y, mal que le pese a Cristina, ""Isabelita"" fue la primera mujer en alcanzar la presidencia, gracias a la voluntad popular y la muerte de su esposo, con el 62% de los votos.
&gt; 
&gt; Los argentinos no somos originales ni siquiera en imprevisibilidad. ¿Quién conocía a Obama meses antes de que fuera presidente de Estados Unidos? Su nombre remitía al de Osama ben Laden, el mayor enemigo de George Bush. ¿Quién podía vaticinar que Donald Trump, ese personaje bufonesco de pelo anaranjado que hasta hace poco veíamos en TV, llegaría adonde llegó? ¿Quién hubiera dicho que Angela Merkel, una mujer formada en la Alemania comunista, sería quien condujera la economía capitalista más poderosa de Europa? ¿Quién hubiese apostado una moneda al flamante presidente de Francia, el desconocido Emmanuel Macron?
&gt; 
&gt; Al contrario de los presidentes que llegaron de manera inesperada, están aquellos que parecían tener todo para serlo y jamás lo lograron. Y los que se prepararon toda su vida para la presidencia y, cuando la alcanzaron, se convirtieron en su propia caricatura, como Fernando de la Rúa. La política es la más impredecible de las ciencias. Es posible calcular la trayectoria de un asteroide y torcer su rumbo con un misil. Pero todavía es imposible torcer la insondable voluntad popular. Ahí vamos a las urnas, atrapados por la eterna antinomia peronismo-antiperonismo que el Gobierno decidió actualizar en la antítesis cristinismo-anticristinismo. Cara o ceca.

Unless the uk does a 180 all those facts will occur, not that i trust they will happen, they will factually happen

Para variar, o título é desnecessariamente enganador. Dá a entender que os portugueses não conseguem tirar férias de uma forma geral, quando isso é obviamente ilegal, toda a gente tem direito a férias. A notícia é sobre a (in)capacidade financeira dos portugueses de passar férias **fora de casa**. A notícia também não é clara sobre a distinção ""fora de casa"" e ""no estrangeiro"" (ora diz um, ora diz outro), o que considerado a realidade portuguesa é bastante relevante (não ter dinheiro para ir ao estrangeiro é uma coisa, não ter dinheiro para ir o Algarve ou qualquer outra zona dentro de Portugal é outra).

My adviser once sent out a mass email to all the grad students in the department informing them that they must only refer to him as Dr. or Professor 'Last Name' until they were ABD, and only then could they refer to him by his first name. Professors may say 'oh please, call me First Name,' but they often get touchy if you assume you can call them that without express permission, because it's too familiar. Even if they don't correct you when you do so, they complain about it among others. Also, calling a specialist librarian 'Mr.' and not Dr. is not well received. Academia is *way* more hierarchical than we like to admit, tbh. 

It's even more important in Europe -- my father loves attending German conferences because people will address him by all his titles, including his multiple PhDs  (not just 'Professor X,' he's 'Herr Doktor Doktor Professor X' and he not so secretly wants an honorary doctorate so that he can be Herr Doktor Doktor Doktor Professor').

Doctored numbers, people previously on unemployment benefits are now 'employed' in a public works scheme to do light part-time labor in exchange for their old benefits (which is 2/3 of the minimum wage). I've seen crews of 10-15 people around where I live, where the majority watched as 2-3 people actually raked leaves. Stories about councils running out of tasks for them are not uncommon. The sole purpose is to be able to say we have 4% unemployment instead of the realistic 8-8.5.

I don't know the reason, I think it's very complex. I'm guessing it is part tradition, part the fact that we have a really broad middle class (don't ask me why), part that because of high wages and high living cost traveling to Scandinavia to work for other Europeans can be very lucrative, including doctors, and with the EU we have limited ways to limit foreign doctor influx, we also have a lot of scandinavians who study medicine in Poland etc and then come back as doctors. They avoid having to face the tough demands of getting into medschool here, can pay their way in, and come back and apply for the same jobs. We also have a very large public health sector which controls wages. There is very little to no room for negotiation when working in a public hospital.

LaRondinella89,,,"I hear you on a lot of this, actually. If capitalism truly worked the way you’re describing I'd have no problem. 

Thing is, almost no one gets paid equal to their value. There’s a lot of esoteric philosophical/theological arguing to be had about the “value"" of a human life in itself, which isn't really my point, but I think you'd agree with me that a person who works a full-time (40-ish hours per week) job should be able to put a roof over their head and food on the table for themselves and their family. The thing is, there are so so so so many people in the US right now for whom that is not a reality. There are people (educated, intelligent people with skills and value to offer society) who can’t get a full time job because there aren’t enough to go around. There are people (educated, skilled etc) who have full time jobs but barely get paid enough to cover rent, food, and the inevitable massive student loan bills that so so many people have. There are people who “did everything right” - were good students, majored in an in-demand field, happened to be born with a talent for in-demand fields, worked hard, networked, and STILL struggle to get off the unpaid-internship hamster wheel or out of the part-time waiting tables side hustles. Shit’s hard out there. The economy is a mess and a lot of good people are hurting. That’s the reality that so many people are facing, it’s not just a cut and dry “get good grades, then you’ll get a job. Work hard, then you’ll get lots of money.” We all grew up hearing that all you had to do was check the right boxes and be a good honest hardworking person and you’d be set for life, and a lot of us are finding out the hard way that that’s not true. 

Another thing to keep in mind is just how much the purchasing power of the dollar has gone down over the past generation or so. In the 60s and 70s, you could buy a house with your first entry level job out of college. These days people struggle to save up well into their 30s and even 40s. Have you seen the studies on how much people have to earn in cities and urban areas to afford 1- or 2-bedroom apartments against how much people actually earn? Have you seen the charts of mean yearly income among the “Millenial” generation (particularly compared to that of our parents’ generations, adjusted for inflation)? We’re poor and struggling and “just working harder” isn’t saving us. We’re already working hard. 

And meanwhile, while most of us are struggling in low-paying jobs with precarious stability, uncertain benefits, little possibility for advancement etc., at the same time, our bosses and their bosses are getting richer at an EXPONENTIAL rate. Our bosses tell us “sorry, we can’t afford to give you a raise, the company would suffer” and then they go off and buy themselves another boat. Our bosses (and politicians, but that’s another rant) tell us that they can’t afford to give us health insurance because the company would suffer, and then they go buy themselves a third vacation property. Entire skyscrapers in New York City, where i live, are virtually empty because they’re owned by absentee foreign magnates who visit maybe a couple times a year, and meanwhile the rest of us are fighting tooth and claw to get an apartment that isn’t a shithole, and increasingly being driven out of town (and therefore away from our families, friends, professional networks) by the skyrocketing rent prices. Supply and demand. Have you ever seen an empty skyscraper full of empty homes, surrounded by a sidewalk full of desperate homeless people?

I’m a more moderate socialist than many in this and other forums, among other things I’m a reformist rather than a revolutionary, and ideally I’d like to see the positive aspects of capitalism preserved in a future hybrid system. You’re right that society has a need and a place for entrepreneurship, risk-takers, businesspeople and innovators. But does it necessarily follow that the entrepreneur should make three HUNDRED times the salary of her employees? Should her employees go to bed every night worrying if they’ll make rent that month? Look up some statistics, the Gini coefficient is a commonly-cited one, to see how much more CEOs earn than their workers. In most countries in Europe (capitalist economies with social-democratic elements) a CEO will earn about 20-30 times as much as their workers. In the US it’s two HUNDRED times more. 

Socialism and communism, as defined way back in the 19th century by Marx and Engels, have nothing to do with “freeloading” or “laziness” or “just not wanting to work.” Marx actually makes a very strong point in the Manifesto that it’s in our nature to want to work, to be productive, to create things and explore and learn and build. He calls it our “Species-being,” which is one of those wonderfully untranslateable German terms. But in a capitalist system as it currently stands (and our current conditions have many similarities with the ones described by Marx, many differences as well but there’s enough to draw strong analogies) most working people are strongly alienated from the act of working and from the products of their labor - they feel no satisfaction in their job and are putting in more and more effort, longer and longer hours, more and more work, and what they get out is either stagnating or diminishing. You said your boss at the fast food joint gave you a raise when you proved your value and took on more responsibilities - I’m glad she did that, but for a lot of people that doesn’t happen. Oh, you need to stay late all week. Here, take on this extra project too. Oh, we’ve expanded your responsibilities. But you want a raise? Don’t make me fire you, I have three dozen highly qualified resumes in my desk drawer and could have your replacement by lunch. 

The philosophical underpinning of socialism is the famous phrase of worker control over “the means of production.” The means of production is whatever instrument or organization your company uses to produce whatever it is you sell, but it also has a more general semiotic meaning.
In the current capitalist system, the business owner controls the means of production, hires and fires employees as part of the same process by which he buys or sells equipment or rents office space. He calls all the shots, makes all the decisions and the workers either put up, shut up, or leave. Sounds fine, until you realize how much those workers desperately need a job. After all, you can’t exactly choose if you want to work or not - you’d be the first to say that everyone has to work. So those of us who for one reason or another never became business owners, or high-level managers, have to just rent out ourselves and our time and our physical and mental labor in order to survive, with no say in what our job entails or how the company is run. It’s depressing and demoralizing and sure, you can say “just work harder and climb the ladder” but in reality very few people ever get to those top positions. The people who don’t make it to the top still matter, are still human beings, and still deserve a life that they want to live. 

For example in a restaurant “worker control of the means of production” doesn’t just mean that the cooks say the kitchen belongs to them but that they get a say in how the restaurant is run. If the kitchen workers all thought it was ethically important to source free-trade coffee and cruelty-free eggs, they could work together with the front office guys to make that happen. If the waiters wanted to negotiate a contract that would give them health benefits, they could talk to the money guys and work out a way to make that happen. Rather than being forced to accept whatever the top boss dictated, they could all collaborate to build a workplace that used their skills effectively AND in return provided them with a good quality of life. 
Socialism means giving ordinary, everyday people the right to control over their own lives.

So they definitely weren't starting with nothing.  And we still don't know who Snoke is, so we don't know what kind of resources he has that he's giving them.

As for the Resistance, you're pretty much right.  The New Republic doesn't initially see the First Order as a threat because they don't think the FO has the resources to be a threat.  And they aren't eager to start a war, so they don't do anything.  In Bloodline, Leia's main issue with the new government is how little they do, because they're afraid to do anything wrong.  That's why Leia breaks off to start the Resistance, in order to do what the New Republic won't.

That also puts context to why Poe looks shocked in Force Awakens after he was brought aboard the Star Destroyer.  Even Leia had no idea that the First Order had the resources that they did, so they had no way of knowing how big of a threat the FO actually was.  Leia was just smart enough to see the potential before the rest of the New Republic.

nomnommish,,5∆,"&gt; This is a true statement though, and does not go against my CMV. Better infrastructure does help minority rights.

I beg to differ. You are conflating ""better standard of life"" with ""being treated better"". They are not the same at all. Minority rights are protected by laws, rights, ability to vote, freedom, etc. One can have a lower standard of life, and still be treated better by one's society or by the majority social group.

&gt; Canada, Switzerland, and Belgium are far more diverse than other countries that treat minorities worse. So no, you point is incorrect.

You are now cherry-picking your Western countries. Truth is, most of Western Europe is extremely little diversity - their minorities do not compete for resources at all with the majority. And I also disagree with your point that they are treating minorities better. Burkha and burkini bans for starters. India is far more tolerant and accepting of various religious practices of minorities.

&gt; Agreed. This point is irrelevant though.

You have chosen to take an extremely narrow viewpoint. The various examples I gave are about India treating minorities despite facing far more severe and far more extreme challenges. Your original statement about ""being treated better"" is always about context, although you reject all attempts at context setting. For example, if you were born to a rich family with access to lots of resources VS being born to a poor family with access to limited resources, then it is incorrect to make your statement without taking the context into account. 

&gt; I don't mean to be rude, but do you have a basic understanding of Indian history? Because this isn't true. The Hindu-Islam clashes are far worse in India then they are in Western countries. Are you familiar with the policies that Modi is implementing? 

Yes, I do have a basic understanding of Indian history. Like I said, you are the one who has cleverly chosen to shoehorn yourself into a very narrow niche. So I guess it all depends what your definition of ""history"" is. Do you mean ""history"" as it applies after the year 2000? 

You can't have your cake and eat it too. If you are going to bring up Indian history, then you need to bring up Western history too, and its track record. And you can't just arbitrarily put a line on the year 2000 because it better suits your POV.

And if you are going to bring up Modi, then you need to answer your own question - what specific policies has Modi implemented after he became the Prime Minister of India, that have been anti-minority?

And Islam-Hindu clashes have to be put in perspective of the overall population. Considering the population of Western European countries, and considering the number of Muslims living there, I argue that they are actually being treated far worse - in terms of percentage of incidents per population.

Have you even looked at the problems France has faced for decades in trying (and failing) to integrate Muslims and specifically African-Muslims and Middle Eastern Muslims into its society? India is honestly a way better example than France in this regard, even if you take the religious riots and unrests into account.

&gt; You genuinely think Muslims are treated better in India than Western countries? Please provide your evidence. I hope you do know that east asian countries are much more xenophobic than western countries. Look at the demographic makeup of Korea and Japan. 

Like I said, I genuinely believe that Muslims in India are treated far better, on average, than Muslims in France are being treated or have been treated in the last couple of decades. Korea and Japan are bad examples, if anything, they are more like Scandinavian countries. They don't even know what immigration and minority means.

daniellee912,sheikmelee,,"The difference between us and other esports is fundamental.

Other areas simply don't have the player base. Melee isn't commercially available, which is a fundamental flaw that we carry. Unlike Dota and other esports, we don't have a developer pushing to fill a player-base funnel with a readily available game. Is it possible that Europe isn't a sustainable market without big publisher intervention?

We have thrown resources into Europe. Twitch helps support their events, but it's a black hole. No return on investment and no circulation or sustainable indicators of growth. BEAST and Heir should be able to survive off of the local players coming to participate. Top players participating would not boost the overall attendance of their events. Both events are failing financially despite outside American resources helping with the event. The best way to explain this is when you invest money into the economy. You hope to invest so that dollars are reinvested. Europe has been shown to be a large blackhole when it comes from the community investing into Smash. Armada himself complains that no one from Europe is stepping up. Players seem fine not traveling or developing their local scenes and prefer just playing netplay.

Americans should not have to deal jetlag because unlike other esports, Smash doesn't have any notable prize pots. Big prize pots at DreamHack don't nearly compensate for the costs. Unless you finish third or better, you're losing money on plane tickets, travel costs, food, and lost stream time. 

It's a heavy net loss for people to travel. The tourneys aren't big. Sponsors aren't there.

DreamHack London is always awfully scheduled during a ton of European events. DreamHacK winter is during Thanksgiving traditionally. This year it isn't, but it's during an awful week.

Also keep in mind many top players aren't full time smash, so they would have to take an entire week off of work. Duck for example is struggling to keep vacation time available for existing majors. Why would he waste 5-6 vacation days on this? Other players have school during DreamHack Winter and finals are just around the corner.

All players can travel, but there's very little reward at all other than the novel idea ""that we need to save European Smash"" or ""Prove that they are the GOAT"". It's novel, but it's thousands of dollars they are having to sacrifice. It's selfish of you to assume that because they don't travel =/= they don't care about the game. Entitled even, lol.

It's like you didn't read what I wrote at all, it's a school of though, many diferent theories get thrown into the mix, especially in such a objective reality doesn't exist, all ideas are equal and don't matter aproach. And again, it's not like there are only 2 positions on the entire world and feminist means automatically american liberal.

&gt;perhaps not as apparent, but the end goal of both post modernism and marxism are aimed to overthrow werstern hierarchy/values/culture, for example, again from your own source

Yes and no. There is no other point to postmodernism than mentally mastrubating about how objective reality doesn't exist, it has no goal further than an armchair ideology. And Marxism only aims at overthrowing Capitalism, it has no opinion on the western culture and its values, as its only an economic philosophy, it doesn't really concern itself that much with social issues

&gt;so basically, trying to say truth is a matter of opinion, which is a direct attack on western culture whose highest moral value is truth.

Wut? No it's fucking not. First of all, there is no such thing as 1 western culture, there is not even 1 European or 1 German culture, let alone an entire unitary Western culture. Secondly, It's not the Wests higher moral value, we ignore it regularly. And you are saying like the fact that its a western value means anything inherently. And thats what I am trying to tell you, exactly thats the point of postmodernism, its an infinite mental circle jerk on how objective reality doesn't exist, it's all just ideas/opinions.

&gt;As for my vast oversimplification of neo-marxist/sjw strategy, history has shown people who use it to overthrow the current hierarchy (also known as 'muh patriarchy' in neo-marxist lingo) never actually make life fair for anyone. the civil rights movement used it to improve our current system, at least initially.

Again, what the fuck are you talking about. You realise there is far more to the world than feminist or anti-feminist. First of all, define me what a Neo-Marxist is and how are they different from Marxists? And overthrowing the Patriarchy is a Feminist goal. Marxist want to overthrow the hierarchy knows as capitalism, the employer-employee hierarchical relationship. Again, Marxism=economics

&gt;at the end of the day its about truth. attention and validation are the most basic forms of power and thats exactly why virtue signalling is a microcosm of the marxist philosophy in action.

I never understood this. Even if virtue signalling means anything and is so often used, why the fuck does it matter? And please explain this. What does marxism has to do with any of this? You are acting like right-libertarians are for example newer smugly virtue signalling about their opinion on taxes. What does the idea that workers should own the means of production have to do with any of this?

&gt;but like you said, its just a strategy, and could be used for good. again, this is why truth is the highest value, the difference between helping minorities for insidious reasons is if you truly care about helping people and are not in it for personal gain. 

You just give a pretty good example of the Anti-Capitalist claim on how divide and counqer is used on our society to divide us by race, gender, sexual orientations, subculture, etc... to prevent us from seeing the true problems in our society, class warfare.

&gt;It would take a lot more writing, but I have ample reason to believe much of the current sjw motivation is personal, using oppressed people as the excuse.

ChildOfComplexity,,Anti-racist is code for anti-reddit,"It's fine to be a rootless cosmopolitan. It's just not an option for everyone, it doesn't work for everyone. 

And if you have people hungering for an identity and all they can find is ""white"", that's an empty hollow thing. Because guess what. ""white culture"" -was- liberal culture. It was based on the logic/propaganda that Europeans were inherently ""civilised"", that civilisation (or whatever equally problematic term you want to use) , democracy, the rule of law etc were the birthright of the ""white race"", and set them apart from other ethnic groups. And it was a tenable position (if you employed the same kind of logic that sees Trump at 35% popular support) when (outside of Europe) there were still nations that were mostly made up of small tribal groups, living in traditional housing, no electricity, no mass media (not even film or radio), etc. So it could still be believed by a majority in 1950, 1930, 1910, 1890 and so on back till the nation state, the rule of law, central government etc were only found in Europe (at least as far as most Europeans were aware).

But the world we live in today is a world post-modernisation, where almost every country has been brought into the sphere of consumer culture, electricity, TV, and increasingly computers, etc are phenomenon ubiquitous to every nation where they haven't be explicitly rejected. There is no town on earth where you won't find a significant amount of literate people, There are less nations on earth where you could sweepingly qualify the population as ""sustenance farmers"" or ""hunter gatherers"" than there are communist nations.

The world has changed, the things that comprised ""white"" identity can no longer even be dreamed of, let alone claimed, as belonging to ""white"" people. So those left with nothing but their whiteness to cling to have no way to assert it but to gatekeep their social position through hate and violence. 

That's where we are. There has to be a solution. But it's not pretending there is no problem. 

To give some context to the problem we are faced with, there is a book ""Aspects of Modern Sociology: Patterns of Urban Life"", that deals with social relations in England in the 50's and 60's. In it there is a chapter that talks about the difficulties the aspirational urban middle class moving to villages for their rustic charm have in integrating with the local population. It posits there are two kinds of ""villager"" (for want of a better term) that is predisposed to reject the encroachment of these outsiders (before taking various structural things about how the social interactions of these groups play out into account). The left wing radicalised working class, for obvious reasons, and the right wing ""traditionalist"", because of the outsiders lack of understanding of the traditional role the wealthy play in village life, i.e. their failure to meet unspoken social obligations. 

My point here is that in ""white"" society there is a similar right-wing ""traditional"" (I use this term only to carry the idea from the last paragraph, not to grant their views any value) group, who people who have internalised liberal values don't understand, and who don't understand liberals. Education seems like the obvious solution, but large portions of this group will explicitly reject it, and I don't see a world, operating under the current social structures, where there is even the political will to seriously -attempt- to educate them. 

So what other solutions can be imagined? Decoupling class status from whiteness might work, though I can't even  begin to imagine how that would be achieved (especially within the framework of capitalism). The other option is remaking the myths that underpin whiteness. Discussing them does this, slowly, and in an unguided manner, but the most obvious direction to go if you were to attack it in a pointed manner is to what immediately preceded ""whiteness"". Another possible direction is working to integrate white identities within the framework of multiculturalism, which would require a reorienting of the myths that underpin multiculturalism -and- education on multiculturalism amongst the white population, but both of those seem like smaller hurdles to overcome than some other approaches, given that the right has nothing coherent to offer on the subject of multiculturalism, just crude growls of no substance.",True,False,,1,1501615511,,1501616542,0,dl0ydmx,False,t3_6qvy9j,t1_dl0l0ls,1503678024,5,False,GamerGhazi,t5_33oia,

&gt; In 2008, Metal Skool changed their name to Steel Panther.

&gt; Steel Panther is a Los Angeles, California based glam metal parody band founded by former LA Guns vocalist   Ralph Saenz  (Michael Starr). Originally formed as ""Metal Skool"" and ""Metal Shop"" they're known for their energetic live show, the longest running metal show on the Sunset Strip. On stage, the band both pays tribute to and lampoons the heyday of 80's glam metal. The band's between-song comedy includes jests at conflict between band members, discussions of drugs, sex, and improvised humor with the crowd.

&gt; Recently they've crossed the Atlantic and have finally started to penetrate the European market with the release of their debut album, ""Feel The Steel"".

&gt; Current Line up: 

&gt; Vocals: Michael Starr aka  Ralph Saenz 
Guitars: Satchel
Drums: Stix Zadinia
Bass: Lexxi Foxxx

Petemcfuzzbuzz,,,"OK let's take this line by line. 

&gt; To say uk imports will cost more after brexit is a fact 

No it isn't. The negotiation has not completed. Also 'UK imports' and 'UK imports from the EU' are two separate things. So this is not fact, it is posturing. 

&gt; To say uk exports will be affected is a fact. 

Yes, this is a fact. We have seen UK exports to Germany increase in the past twelve months. 

So yes this is factual, but not positive or negative. We are looking for negative facts. 

&gt; To say the pound will devalue is a fact. 

To say 'the pound has devalued' would be a fact. A positive one, as by many accounts it was overvalued and affecting our exports market. 

To say the pound will devalue, further I assume, is posturing. It probably will fluctuate significantly up and down over the coming months, but where it will end up, no one knows. 

&gt; To say uk government bonds will be affected is a fact. 

Is it? How so? But again they could long term be affected positively or negatively. The assumption that they will be affected negatively in the long term is simply that, an assumption. So no facts here. 

&gt; To say london banks will leave because of brexit is a fact (its happened)

No banks have left. Most banks have increased their hiring in the city, as well as arranging for a small contingent to be set up in the EU. 

So no facts here. Just more posturing. 

&gt; To say the uk will be dropped from all regulatory eu cover is a fact. 

Yes, this is what the referendum was for, and what the UK public asked for. So not a negative fact, just a fact. 

&gt; To say uk will not benefit from eu research and development is a fact. 

Nope. The UK involvement in EU R&amp;D will be part of the negotiation. So not a fact, more posturing. 

&gt; To say uk will take years, if ever, to get comparative trade deals to what they had in the eu is a fact. 

Not a fact - other than if your definition of 'years' is the two year period of article 50. I actually agree that it will probably take longer, but that doesn't make it a fact, just an assumption. 

&gt; To say uk government revenue will be down is a fact

Erm. No. Really? 

&gt; To say eu subsidies will end is a fact

Yes, we are leaving the EU. So the money they spend in the UK, which is less than the money we give them for the pleasure, will end. We can cover all subsidies into their entirety if we wish, and still be better off cash-wise. 

So a fact, but not a negative one. 

&gt; The negative costs of all these facts on the uk economy is a fact. 

Nope. The only facts here are only negatives to the people who want to stay in the EU. To the rest of us, the reasoned majority, they are what we voted for. 

But your posturing that these assumptions are not only facts but negative ones is just your biased assumptions, nothing more. 

&gt; You are either completely ignorant on the most basic of economic matters to not realise this or just lying in the face of known facts

Think you need to look up 'fact' before you label anyone ignorant.

I started out as technical instructor (programming, electronics, electrical engineering, cad, IT, recycling technology) right after graduating from my BSc and after completing the mandatory military service in my country. Then I got recruited as technical instructor on an onshore oilfield in the Sahara, where after one year I suddenly became chief automation technician (even though I never worked with PLCs or Control Systems, nor had the faintest clue of oilfield processes or automation), was in charge for the automation of the entire oilfield including 3 gas turbines (again, zero clue about power generation or gas turbines). Was there for 15 years and learnt a lot. While there, I wrote some EU computer courses.

Then I had to leave due to political circumstances in the country (Arab spring) and ended up in a global company that among other businesses does large scale industrial automation. 

My first job was automating a rotating kiln in an industrial waste incineration plant (guess what - no clue again). 4 years and six project parts later (one more rotating kiln, 2 fluidized bed furnaces, 2 water treatment plants, 1 tank farm and one ash storage/treatment plant) I moved on to other projects in the same company. Next project: a ship lock (same as usual). Next project after: a pump storage hydroelectric power plant, and so on.
