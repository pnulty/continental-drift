You'd still be working towards the same goals, actually! Continuing the MSQ is always a good goal to have, and getting Ironworks (and then augmenting it) is something every fresh 50 should be working towards. I talked more about how to do that [here]() just now, if you need a refresher.

You may want to run through the Hall of the Novice to remind yourself of your class's basics and of how dungeons work; it also rewards a nice XP boosting ring if you wind up wanting to level any other combat classes.

&gt; Additionally, I think I read a couple weeks back about some Realm transfer incentives. Are those still active and something worth looking into?

It's probably not worthwhile for you - there's a bonus for transferring from any world to a new world, but the only new worlds are on the European data center, so that's not a good idea if you're in NA. There's also a bonus for transferring from a congested world to a preferred world, but Hyperion isn't a congested world.

Os portugueses é que foram os que lucraram com a escravatura certo? Mas os exemplosque dás são todos no Brasil.

Brasil que era colônia de Portugal...portanto, todos os senhores de terras aqui eram portugueses e parte de tudo o que era produzido no Brasil ia diretamente para a Coroa portuguesa. Não interessa se são seus antepassados ou não, eles não deixam de ser portugueses, não deixam de estar explorando a terra e a vida de pessoas em nome, e para o lucro de Portugal.

&gt;Não concordo. A História de Portugal, mesmo se considerarmos só os últimos 900 anos, é uma coisa muito mais antiga que escravidão transatlântica,mais abrangente, que envolve muitos outros temas de interesse aos alunos portugueses. Claro que se fala de escravatura e do triângulo do Atlântico e do Padre António Vieira em Português.

A História da colonização do Brasil e da escravidão cobre quase 400 anos de toda a História de Portugal. E se Portugal tem uma História tão abrangente assim não cabe nela a escravidão do Atlântico? Ou cabe apenas glorificar a Escola de Sagres?

&gt;e conheces tu o ensino na sala, se é mencionado ou não, ou vais apenas pela opinião dela? Porque as anedotas pessoais dela, no seu contexto são idiotas.

Ela é uma pesquisadora acadêmica, não são anedotas pessoais, são resultados de uma pesquisa sobre o tema. 


&gt;E se há mais afastamento do ensino em Portugal que por exemplo no Brasil em relação ao tema da escravatura transatlântica talvez faça sentido, porque a sua influência está-nos muito mais distante.  E temos mais história além daquela que toca o Brasil. 

Novamente, o período no qual Portugal mais floresceu economicamente foi aquele em que Brasil era sua principal colônia, aquele em que o açúcar era feito por negros escravizados, o ouro era minado por negros escravizados e que o café era colhido pelos mesmos negros.

Superbeastreality,,,"&gt; Of course you're not offended, that's the point. I wonder why....

Well then don't make an objective statement about a subjective matter.



&gt;Cultural appropriation is only ""cultural appropriation"" when it's the dominant culture doing the appropriating. You can't really ""appropriate"" a dominat culture forced on you... but hey.. according to your logic..



The hypothetical group of people who you suggest as possibly using a quasi-european system would not have had it forced on them. Wasn't that your point?




&gt;Of course it wouldn't make you uncomfortable because you regard it as fantasy and not something rooted in any minute sense of possibility. 


Actually, my people were subjucated for about 800 years, it's arguably still ongoing. Bit rude to make such assumptions. But, I'll leave it at that because I'm not the type to get upset about the past. 

Anyway, your statement

&gt;Of course it wouldn't make you uncomfortable because you regard it as fantasy and not something rooted in any minute sense of possibility. 


seems to contradict your earlier statement




&gt;If it were meant to ""teach a lesson"", why not role reverse? What would happen if it were white slaves instead of black? What if indigenous had repelled invasions or adopted a quasi-european system (for scenic relatability within the program i.e. High Castle style)? I bet that would feel a bit uncomfortable, no?


Funny, that. 




&gt;Your privilege is safe and sound. 



What privilege is that? 




&gt;Hell, your demographic gets up in arms over comic book characters swapping races/genders. Stop it lol. 



That's a generalisation, isn't it? It's a bit at odds with your next statement....





&gt;Africa is an entire continent.. arguably the largest. Therefore, it's illogical to band an entire continent under one specific social / culture structure.



Of course it's okay to group all white people together, but not Africans. You're a hypocrite. 



&gt;Nations sold prisoners to other (non African) for capital or political influence, etc. Obviously not knowing this would lead to industrialized slavery based on little but the genetic makeup of slaves and their family in perpetuity. You're an idiot for this attempted retort. Seriously.



You're saying that they sold their fellow Africans without realising that those Africans would be treated as slaves? That's weird. Are you saying that Africans lack foresight? It's a strange argument you're presenting. How do you believe that they didn't think that creating a slave industry would lead to indutrialised slavery? 




&gt;Look up ""house slaves"" in reference to ""field slaves"" or refer to Django. That answers your ""but there's black people involved"" statement. 



I didn't make a ""but there's black people involved"" statement, I asked you a question. A question and a statement aren't the same thing. Did you ever go to school? 

And what is your point here? That any black person that writes a story about an alternate history where black people are still enslaved in the US is a race traitor, or brainwashed....? What is it?




&gt;Also, generalizing a race's reaction based on a few individuals is inherently racist.




I don't remeber generalising a race's reaction. I do remember you saying


&gt;Hell, your demographic gets up in arms over comic book characters swapping races/genders. Stop it lol. 


You're a hypocrite and a liar. 






&gt;You need to socialize more often. Maybe you'll change your myopic mindstate by default. Now, suck you mum.


I'm fairly social. Maybe you should get outside your echo chamber and learn to deal with people who have different opinions to yours in a mature way, rather than throwing out childish insults, making things up, making racist generalisations, and playing the perpetual victim. 


It'd be really nice if you could go on with your life without such a chip on your shoulder. It's not good for your heart. This whole ""us versus them"" attitude won't get you anywhere. Good luck with your life.

Last time I tried to research this whole 'No dual citizenship' thing I couldn't find any evidence that a single person has ever had their citizenship revoked in any EU country that doesn't allow dual citizenship. It's essentially a non-issue. It's an unenforceable law. 

There's no way to prove if someone is or isn't a citizen of another country, without the cooperation of that other country. And we have no incentive to cooperate.

Sacha117,,,"&gt; Europe is underfunding its military.

Just because the US overspends on military does not mean that the EU is underfunding its military.

&gt; Yes they could mobilize their society to a war economy, but they're completely unprepared for a first strike.

First strike by whom exactly? Russia? Russia's army is 50% the size of the EU's combined forces, and spends 1/3rd what the EU spends on the military. The EU is totally prepared for a first strike by Russia, that's basically what the European military is for.

&gt; Hell France and Italy couldn't even handle Libya, they ran out of munitions.

They didn't run out of munitions, they simply said that maintaining bombings at the intense rate they were was unsustainable because they didn't have enough *laser-guided missiles*, which is what was used in those missions. Their stockpiles quickly depleted but never ran out, and they were forced to ask Germany to restock them.

However I don't think that proves anything, because the EU as a whole didn't run out of laser guided missiles, only two countries did. It would be like asking Texas and Pennsylvanian to fight on behalf of the whole United States, and then say that the US has an underfunded military because they had to ask Virginia for some laser-guided missiles before they ran out.

&gt; You're arguing potential lives saved VS lives directly ended.

No I'm not, because the figures that you likely have in mind regarding 'communist deaths' are largely deaths from starvation. So it is totally fair to point out that capitalism, still to this day, actually causes far higher levels of starvation than communism supposedly did. And like I said, many millions of the deaths attributed to 'communism' are **abortions**, and/or completely fabricated.

If you dispute this please cite me a source for these deaths that supposedly make communism the most lethal ideology ever, according to yourself?

&gt; You talk like a troll and a child, I'm not avoiding your arguments, I'm avoiding you.

You're avoiding me? Why would you then respond to what I said two times with insults? Really mature are you?

I would just like to add that the US doesn't want the EU to have a strong army, it's why the US has threatened to force the EU out of Nato if it goes ahead with its plan for a unified EU army, which when complete would instantly make the EU the second most powerful nation in the world and an instant superpower. It isn't in the interests of the US for the EU to be a challenger on the world stage. You're mistaken if you think otherwise, and that's part of the reason the UK and US have worked so hard to hamstrung the EU's military capabilities.

&gt; No I just don't argue with people who call me trumpets, and say I'm brainwashed by the media without any more context, and say wake up bro.

Why are you offended that I called you a Trumpet? You are aren't you? I looked at your comment history just below this comment string you posted on the_donald. So I was right, you are a Trumpet. Damn, you guys are right, winning this much sure does feel great...

&gt; and say I'm brainwashed by the media without any more context

Dude I told you why you're brainwashed, I did give you context. I will repeat it: thinking that communism is the most lethal ideology to ever exist. Not that Communism was ever achieved of course, and yes Soviet Russia and Maoist China was terrible, I agree, but Socialism/Communism/whatever you want to call it *definitely was not the most lethal ideology in history*. And that's by a very big margin man.

&gt; I'm not arguing with a child, I have better things to do.

Alright, guess I won't be hearing back from you then. Or if I do it will likely be an insult, rather than using your superior intellect and maturity to explain to my infantile and retarded brain why actually the EU is underfunded as the second most powerful force in the world, and why communism actually was the most lethal ideology in the world more lethal than nationalism, religion, or racism.

snailslimeandbeespit,,Low Buy,"Oh gosh, I don't know if China has more scams than other countries – I've heard of lots of scamming and pickpocketing in Europe as well. I imagine scams happen everywhere, and who is scammed where depends on lots of factors. I'm a Caucasian female, so there are certain places where I'm likelier to stand out as an ""outsider,"" plus I think people might assume that women are easier targets. Moreover, I just have lots of personal experience with being scammed in China because I've lived there and traveled there a lot, including traveling alone, whereas I've never been to continental Europe, Latin America (beyond Mexico, Puerto Rico, and some Caribbean islands), the Middle East, or Africa. 

If I had to guess, and this is pure conjecture, I think the stark income inequality in China is a huge factor. As for Hong Kong and Taiwan being different (though they still have pickpocketing), maybe they're not that different but it's just that I've been lucky? I actually think that HK does have scams, but they're probably scams targeting mainland visitors (there's a strong anti-mainland sentiment in HK right now). Oh, of course there are suit makers and watch sellers in Tsim Sha Tsui who target foreign tourists, but I think these are different kinds of scams, more like you might be ripped off and pay too much for a fake Rolex, and I always ignore those pushy sellers (plus, I don't spend that much time in TST). Also, as far as I know, in present-day HK you don't have a different pricing system based on a person's race or nationality, so there's no need for someone to help you get a cheaper ""local price"" ticket for things like what happened to me with the guy who bought my boat ticket. As for Taiwan, I would say that even though it has some problems with unemployment, overall it's a relatively more stable society than the mainland. It was ranked the #1 place in the world to live recently, and I imagine that when people are able to make a decent living, they are less inclined to resort to scamming people to make money. I also think HK and Taiwan have a lot more regulations about certain things, and I imagine that scammers hanging around places like the airport would not be tolerated (but I could be wrong). However, honestly, I really don't know, and again, I'm just basing things on my personal experience. I'm hesitant to make assumptions based on other factors. 

I don't think this should discourage you from visiting China or anywhere else. Wherever you go,  you just need to be careful. I have a friend who was robbed by a child in the Louvre. Another friends' parents were pick pocketed in Italy – her parents live in China and have never been pick pocketed there. I could also tell you lots of stories where strangers have been very kind to me in China. For example, once my friend and I were on a long-haul train during Chinese New Year, and we met an older couple who wanted us to go to their home for dinner before we went on to Hong Kong (they lived in Guangzhou, near HK) as they didn't want us to be alone on a holiday. (It would be akin to a stranger inviting someone to spend Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner with someone here.) And I have many other positive stories like this too. 

I think ultimately you can get scammed just about anywhere, but if you're careful you'll be fine. I suspect that scams are likelier to happen in touristy areas, so just have your guard up when you're in those places. It also occurs to me as I'm writing this that during my past few HK trips I haven't really been in any touristy areas, so that might play a factor, and most of the touristy places I've gone to in Taiwan have been with Taiwanese friends. Keep in mind that all the China tales I told you in my the post happened when I was traveling alone. Anyway, there are lots of lovely places to visit in China, and it's probably more interesting than HK from a tourist perspective.

Also interesting from your article:

&gt;A majority of workers still earn less in real terms than they did nearly a decade ago.

The fact that the author doesn't even consider a possible connection between this sentence and the prior couple of paragraphs is fascinating to me. It seems pretty clear to me that their wages have not gone up because (a) the UK has cheerfully imported millions of people to take less desirable jobs, keeping wages down, and (b) the UK has very generous benefits, such that many people rationally choose to not work or to work very little instead of working fully time or at all. Also:

&gt;The paradox is summed up by two women I interviewed recently. Both were single mothers living on benefits they denounced as far too low. Both had voted for Brexit. Both believed there were too many foreigners here. And both were scandalized when I asked whether they would take vacant jobs in cafes or shops. **“They’re immigrants’ jobs,” one said.**

The fact that the author doesn't even consider that they're descriptively correct, per her own example, doesn't seem relevant somehow. As if having thousands of immigrants take jobs in cafes and shops had been the sole *result* of native British refusal to work those jobs, instead of the other way around (or as mutually reinforcing and entrenching phenomenon).

That doesn't necessarily mean that kicking out all the immigrants (or gutting welfare) is the answer, especially in the short term.

We don't even have 33% of vehicles reliably participating in dynamic events, let alone finishing all of them. As such, the desires of FH may well be academic at best. It might be worthwhile to make the dynamic events more accessible to more teams (and more drive train types) until we can attract enough teams to get the numbers to climb.

For example in my current game (it was about 1565) I beat the piss out of Hungary and forced them to release Translyvania; who would accept a diplo vassalization if I sold them one province in Slovakia (due to it being one of their cores) so I did so. After that I declared my Excommunication war on a 8 province Mantua and Austria (my ally) honoured their CTA. Austria's outlived their usefulness and I have no intentions of keeping in kind with them from this point forward so I am going to separate peace them and cripple their nation by dividing them into chunks.


As for late game specifically? Max out your absolutism as quickly as you can; don't worry about having high autonomy everywhere you want to be able to pound down that plunger for the Absolutism when you get into the third age on as many provinces as you can.

If you can save up military points do it; you can dump these into rebellions or to increase legitimacy to bump your Absolutism as well.

Once you get to your current cap (or near it) trigger the disaster; if you have to lower your stability by doing things you never would. If you're prepared for it you can trigger the disaster and have it resolved within the first 30-40 years of having Absolutism activated.

That increase is *huge*. If you're blobbing you want Administrative ideas as one of your first four groups more likely than not; even without the CCR -1.00 interest per annum and +5 states are both *huge* bonuses now that states are so insanely limited.

Don't worry about stating bad stuff either; if it isn't 35+ development you probably don't want to worry about it. 

If you're worried about becoming behind time or filling out an idea group don't state core *anything*; put it off. \


If you max out your Absolutism you should be able to conquer most of France in 2-3 wars. (Depends how large they've gotten) generally you want to try to cut the legs out of your primary competitors early in the game, even more so if they are a colonizer, crippling Iberia, France and England will give you a monopoly on new world regions and trade companies which you can use to crush Europe beneath the heel of your boot even further.

Here's an example of my current game in 1575 where I left off last time I was playing; I'm Sardinia-Piedmont; Mazovia, Catolonia, Translyvania and Lithuania are vassals. France I have a union over. I'm currently allied with Russia, Colonge, Bohemia and Saxony. I'm at war with Mantua &amp; Austria, Krakow, and Holland. (3 wars) and I have truces with every major nation nearby except for the Muslims. 

Don't be afraid to go over your diplo limit if you get a huge power boost out of it. (HRE Emperorship is pretty big one) 

When I get to Absolutism I'm going to pool Military points and get it up quickly and absorb land in India, Africa and the Middle East exceedingly quickly.

BoaseMan,,minarchist,"It's a long story, I'll try to shorten it as much as I can.

I got into world politics 2 years ago when some internet friends I was hanging out with talked about the civil war in Syria and Ukraine, and other stuff. They were almost all leftists (socialists, commies). One even volunteered to Rojava mostly because they are socialists. I thought to myself ""Holy shit, this guy is going to war for his ideology, I mean socialism must be amazing if he is willing to die for it."" The problem was that since I'm from Romania we have a bad history with socialism/communism, to give you some context: saying that a teacher is a communist means he's old, harsh, outdated and a bad teacher. So I was always told they suck.

Two years ago I read the Communist Manifesto and I was browsing marxists.org. 16 year old me was hooked: you're telling me that what stands between the current system and utopia are a bunch of rich fat bastards that exploit us?! Where do I sign up for the revolution? (cringy, I know). It looked so good: a classless, moneyless utopia where everyone is equal and you have everything, and the working class just has to get together and overthrow the filthy capitalists and set up a dictatorship of the proletariat, then slowly as we advance in production and technology and so on we will have so much shit we're not gonna need a state and it will simply give up its powers once we reach a communist society.

Now before I realised this is bullcrap utopian stupidity that can't and will never work for I don't know how many reasons...

As I got tired of reading the theory I started hanging out on leftist forums (not on reddit), and watching leftist media in general on Youtube. That's when I found out how many variations of socialism there were... if you get 5 socialists to talk about socialism there's gonna be at least 2 or 3 different ways to achieve it, or what makes a country socialist and so on.

Meanwhile all of this made me hate my parents a bit because they have a small business and had a few empoyees... Marx was basically telling me my parents were slave owners. That was the first red flag that made me question what that bearded guy wrote in those books.

Then slowly I started to see the hypocrisy and the lies of the far left and the left in general. Nobody fucking knew anything about economics for one thing but hey they read that capitalism sucks and so they're experts now, also it's evil cause the US does bad things but hey let's forget about the much bigger massacres socialist countries did.

Almost every God damn leftist keeps talking about racism and ""institutionalized racism"" in todays America and in Europe with the migrant crisis... even though most of it is caused by leftist politicians (see: race baiters of the left in US politics and Merkel&amp;co. letting the doors open to people from Eritrea all they way up to Afghanistan) and where there is none they find it somewhere with bullshit like white privilege, cultural appropriation and other bullshit terms.

Basically I was slowly getting ""red pilled"" by myself if you will. By the start of this year I was a socialist just in name, or generally just a leftist, I thought that even if most socialists were batshit insane a communist society was a nice ideal. I had some IRL stuff to do so I put politics down for a bit.

In my free time browsing youtube though I started finding out right leaning political commentary channels, I started watching debates, etc. And they made so much more fucking sense than anything I was subscribed to or read before. 

I also saw what is going on in american society with all the SJWs and crazy liberals.

Fast forward to me browsing reddit more and commenting more (for a long time I didn't comment much) I couldn't keep myself from not talking to people when I saw BS and the ban on the socialism sub was the last straw.

I've seen how much the mainstream media is biased in favour of the left, how I never heard anything bad about Obama from them even though he divided americans on racial lines and he fucked Libya and Syria among other things.

I started learning about american history and the founding fathers, I started wathcing alt-media on YT(not the alt right type).

Fast forward to today: I think what the founding fathers had in mind for America is the closest thing we can have in real life to a utopia. My ideal country is capitalist, libertarian, and has a limited government.

edit: well this turned into a rant more or less, sry, I posted it from my phone as well so I had to leave some stuff out cause my fingers hurt.

If there aren't, I pretend to take my time taking them off, because half the time I get them off, the host turns around and tells me to leave them on. If I exaggerate the time, and the host says nothing, I know they want them off. If you know the person well, you can just ask, or you'll remember their preference. It's definitely odd, but it's a custom you get used to. I think, generally, the people who want you to keep them on just want you to not have to worry about extra effort and just come on in. It seems that, especially Europeans on here, view it as Americans saying ""don't get too comfortable in my home"", when really, they are saying ""don't inconvenience yourself"". Of course, my view is that you should take them off, because you are tracking dirt and stuff in the house, but when my in laws or other Americans come over, I let them leave their shoes on and clean, afterwards.

the British had no goods to sell to china, and were desperate for tea and silk and porcelain. 

so the British decided to enter the drug trade in china, even though it was illegal. 
they knew created opium laced tobacco products and started shifting it in china. opium and tobacco are highly addictive and they knew it. 

chinese paid for it in silver, and then British bought silk and tea and so forth with it. or straight swap with chinese merchants etc. 

chinese banned opium again as addiction skyrocketed, supply creates it's own demand. no doubt usual drug tactics of freebies were being used to introduce new addicts. Game has never changed. 

So chinese banned opium again more strictly, but British ignored it and kept pushing it. cos they had the military might to do so. just like today usa does what it wants in middle east, putting dictators and so forth to take oil. 

then chinese got annoyed, killed a few British people. Britain beat them bad, stole some land. and the same happened again. 

then mao and communists came along in ww2. British were militarily weak after 2 world wars. US was no longer in the opium business on a large scale, and Europe wasn't really interested in tea, or silk, given india and mainly industrialisation. 

Oil was the new big thing and western eyes had turned to middle east. So mao was left free to round up all the drug dealers and executed them. And it wasn't worth fighting millions of fanatical chinese communists to push opium anymore. 

P.S. The taliban had actually wiped out the opium trade in Afghanistan, but under British and US military rule it has flourished again. And is constantly being pushed into Iran. 

A lot of people suspect US and British are doing it deliberately to socially collapse Iran through drug addiction. Like Mexico. 

This is why Iran and many middle eastern countries are so strict on drug laws. As they see it as a proxy war run by CIA and Mossad, for Isrel and the bankers benifit.

dancing-turtle,,,"&gt; mental gymnastics 

That's the latest buzzword, huh? I keep seeing trolls here accuse this lately, and then engaging in it themselves. 

&gt; stacking up with story after story, tweet after tweet, defending the Trump administration and attacking their political enemies.

You are reading their twitter very very selectively if that's what you get out of it. Your bias is showing. They have criticized Trump and his administration many times. Most recently, [Scaramucci for saying he wants to ""kill all the leakers""](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/890712365599268864), since go figure, WikiLeaks is pro-leakers, not pro-Trump admin. I could dig up plenty more examples of where they've been critical of Trump, Pompeo, Tillerson, etc. -- try a twitter search. It's like people are wearing blinders that filter everything out that doesn't fit their narrative, I swear.

You are so out of touch with reality, I can't possibly believe that this comment was written in good faith. I do not have the energy to go through it all point for point, but here are a couple glaring problems. 

&gt; The idea that the FBI or the DNC or the Deep state is pushing this to save face 

It's not about saving face, it's about undermining public support for the organization that keeps it going (WikiLeaks is entirely donor-funded), deflecting the public's attention from current and future leaks and, and moving the narrative to something else that suits their agenda, and they've been wildly successful. This is so obvious I'm not sure how anyone can even disingenuously claim otherwise. 

&gt; DT has sewn distrust in NATO

Take it from a Canadian -- [Trump has been consistently](http://globalnews.ca/news/3477993/donald-trump-nato-defence-spending/) pushing for [strengthening NATO](https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-poland-missile-sale-eu-nato/3930529.html) across the board. That is against Russian interests.

&gt; Trump is close to Vetoing the bill instead of signing it into law. 

[No he isn't.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-diplomats-idUSKBN1AD1DV) At least not according to any coverage I've seen. Citation? And the whole point of these sanctions is that he can't then remove them without congressional approval. 

&gt; At the end of the day, Putin is on top easily.

By any reasonable standard, Russia is now in the worst diplomatic position they've been in since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

&gt; How can you reconcile Wikileaks attacking Mueller the SAME WEEK that its being reported that Trump is considering firing him?

They literally always talk about and link things in their leaks that mention people being discussed in relation to current events. That's their their thing. Someone's in the news? Here's an email or cable that mentioned them! If you were actually a routine follower of WikiLeaks, you would know this. For example, [when Rex Tillerson was announced as nominee for Sec. of State.](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/807701824539127809)

But you've tipped your hand -- it's clear your agenda is not the truth but smearing WikiLeaks. How boring.

All of these feature the best cameras and screens found on any phone, USBC, ip68, sd835 soc, and will receive updates until Android 9 (we are on Android 7 now).

&amp;nbsp;

If you want something a little cheaper, you can go for an s7 or s7 edge. The cameras are still great, screens are still great (but are of the 16x9 variety - not as future proof as s8 family's 18.5x9), and are still ip68 water resistant. However, they still use microUSB, so if future proofing​ is top priority, these are maybe not the best bet. They also use an older, less efficient sd820 soc, but will still handle fgo just fine. They will receive updates until Android 8.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: forgot to mention, if you're going to go for an s7, try to buy a Canadian, European, or international unlocked model. These use the Exynos 8890 soc, rather than than Snapdragon 820 in the American models. The 8890 is much easier on the battery, and will get you an extra hour or 2 of screen on time. These models also have a nicer dac, for nicer audio. They can be bought off eBay, bhphoto, etc for \~400 usd last time I checked.

&amp;nbsp;

If you want something even cheaper, buy an s6. Nah, I'm just kidding, the battery is a pile of dog in those. Stay far, far away if you value your waifu.

How about you showcase your sanctimonious intellect, and maturity and simply answer the question? What is racist about telling illegal immigrants to return to their country? Why do they get to skip the process that so many others are doing to enter the country legally? Because they have a sob story?

Here's my sob story on illegal immigrants:
http://www.gao.gov/assets/320/316959.pdf
""Based on our random sample, GAO estimates that the criminal aliens had an average of 7 arrests, 65 percent were arrested at least once for an immigration offense, and about 50 percent were arrested at least once for a drug offense. Immigration, drugs, and traffic violations accounted for about 50 percent of arrest offenses. About 90 percent of the criminal aliens sentenced in federal court in fiscal year 2009 (the most recently available data) were convicted of immigration and drug-related offenses. About 40 percent of individuals convicted as a result of DOJ terrorism-related investigations were aliens. SCAAP criminal aliens incarcerated in selected state prison systems in Arizona, California, Florida, New York, and Texas were convicted of various offenses in fiscal year 2008 (the most recently available data at the time of GAO’s analysis). The highest percentage of convictions for criminal aliens incarcerated in four of these states was for drug-related offenses. Homicide resulted in the most primary offense convictions for SCAAP criminal aliens in the fifth state—New York—in fiscal year 2008.""

http://www.fairus.org/publications/the-fiscal-burden-of-illegal-immigration-on-united-states-taxpayers
""This report estimates the annual costs of illegal immigration at the federal, state and local level to be about $113 billion; nearly $29 billion at the federal level and $84 billion at the state and local level. The study also estimates tax collections from illegal alien workers, both those in the above-ground economy and those in the underground economy. Those receipts do not come close to the level of expenditures and, in any case, are misleading as an offset because over time unemployed and underemployed U.S. workers would replace illegal alien workers. "" 


Hey did you know that California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, New York have the highest murder count (in that order)… Did you also know that California, Texas, Florida, New York have the highest amount of illegal immigrants in that order? (The one discrepancy with Illinois, is almost entirely due to Chicago and the unfortunate reality of black on black crime!)

There is a scientific truism that says, “Correlation can not prove causation, but a failure to correlate can prove non-causation”. 

&gt; Racist, no, messed up, yes. 

Hmmm evidently it's not racist for Japan to deny refugees, they also have some of the strictest immigration policies. Just like China (you ignored my question about China, ironically you go on about cherry picking).

&gt; and not even a month later at least two Turkish ""refugees"" were caught and arrested for gang rape.

Yes two ""refugees"" (from a group less than 50) seeking asylum in Japan, not even a few weeks in gang rape one of their citizens!

&gt; And how many American troops in Japan have done the same? TWO freaking refugees? Are you kidding me? Are you this retarded? They want our troops removed because we consistently do this to them.

50 refugees in a few weeks versus 50,000+ US American troops in Japan: Back in 1995 three US servicemen raped a Japanese schoolgirl, February of last year a US servicemen raped a drunk young girl in Okinawa (which houses over 60% of the US military personnel in Japan). (and this guy talks about false equivalences??). 

 &gt; I didn't know we suddenly cared about Africa. Please, tell me how Africa is about to invade us or do anything at all to threaten the balance of your holy race war.

Race war? That's quite the jump, just merely remarking on the fact that every other countries, are protecting their borders, kicking out immigrants, practising ""institutionalized racism"".

&gt; Yeah, DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO UNTO YOU. The idea is we ARENT a third world retarded backwards country that just murders people for fun or because we disagree with them. and if you're so interested in their immigration policies, I doubt you will take offence to me quoting Ann then by saying ""GO TO THOSE COUNTRIES AND GET OUT OF AMERICA.""

Geez: ""Japan is a really screwed up place"", from your own words Saudi Arabia is a really screwed up place, South Africa and Zimbabwe are irrelevant. Alluding the countries that don't accept immigrants of different ethnicities or races, are ""Backward, retarded, countries that murder people for fun""... what are you a white supremacist or something? Because it is an incontrovertible fact the only countries that accept mass immigration of different ethnicities and races are predominately white ones! Basically the only countries you haven't insulted. And take a Xanax, relax your superiorly intellectual and mature self— I don't live in America.

&gt; Republicans started identity politics but I doubt you actually did research on this subject and instead just took what Ben Shapiro said to actually mean something other than just randomly spouted dates with circular logic.

understand that who truly started the plotting of identity politics will likely never be know. The Southern strategy is said to have really begun implementation with Richard Nixon ( although it is said, mostly speculated that its plotting didn't originate there but without question that's when it really begun to be implemented widely), his predecessor Lyndon B Johnson, is widely known for his Vulgarities and use of the N-word. When he appointed an African-American to the supreme court he is known to have said “Son, when I appoint a n***** to the court, I want everyone to know he’s a n**.” Well right there is identity politics being implemented already before Nixon! LBJ is also noted to have stated: ""I will have these n** voting Democrat for the next 200 years!"" . Now this is a very polemic topic, on whether or not this was actually said by him although there are better cases proving it almost just from the man's past history alone, then there is disproving it. Regardless, his admission about his reasons in regards to putting the African-American on the Supreme Court was implemented before Nixon and that is incontrovertibly identity politics. And sure enough he most certainly did secure the black vote for the Democratic Party!

Also realize that America is not the whole world! Identity politics can be traced back to the Russian Revolutions back in 1917. When Lenin divided and brought the peasants and proletarians against the Bourgeoisie. Lenin then created the label of the ""vampiric kulaks"" and vilified these sort of people that I had work their way up to employ people to work their land. Of which hundreds of thousands were unjustly arrested. Then Stalin created the label podkulaknic: basically anyone that they deemed to sympathize or be in line with the dreaded kulaks. Incontrovertible all of this was made possible by liberalism to its farthest extent communism/collectivization. I know it's hard for you Americans to realize anything outside of your borders but liberalism is the creator of identity politics!

Well in terms of refugees, in the country that took in the most: of course being Germany that is not true.

""Around 975,000 migrants were receiving benefits"" (they took in just over 1 million at this time , And this number does not include those with refugee status or those entitled to asylum!) almost 2/3 of the benefits received came from Asia, with half of this group coming from Syria! 22% came from European countries such as Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, Massadona the rest came from Africa. http://www.businessinsider.com/r-number-of-migrants-claiming-benefits-in-germany-surges-by-169-percent-2016-9

Every country takes time to develop on their own, with the squeeze of wealth from the British, in the long term, it did more harm than good.

The FDA is *considering* these regulations not because of biocompatibility concerns but because of implant migration. During MRI scans, different screw configurations cause different forces and heating to be applied to soft tissue and bone that have so far had wildly different effects on how implants move around well after they have been implanted and scanned in an MRI. Voluntary guidance documents have been around for a while now that explain how to balance positioning and select proper screw materials for passive implants but they've been ignored by a lot of companies, which have caused many incidents of implants dislodging during the worst possible times: during surgery and most often during physical activity when the patient is far away from a clinical setting, long after any MRI scans. What investigators have found is that implant migration or dislodging is far more likely with some screw configurations and especially with patients who have had MRI scans after the device was implanted - that's why the FDA and the EU are working on these new regulations.

The metal itself is only important insofar as each different metal (and each company's manufacturing process) has an impact on those factors and biocompatibility tests are *very* often waived when data is available with proof that the manufacturer's product is equivalent within a certain margin of error.

rocketsocks,,,"This is mostly not a question of history but a question of biology and basic dynamics of infectious disease. Many infectious diseases tend to burn themselves out and become endemic after cycles of epidemics.

The way that natural biological disease immunity works is that after being exposed to a pathogen and recovering the human immune system retains a memory of the infection (in the form of B-cells et al) which enable it to respond to additional attempts at infection vastly more effectively than to a novel infection (triggering this immunity is also how vaccines work). The basic simplistic model for the spread of an infectious disease is a population divided up into susceptible individuals (those who have no exposure or immunity to the disease), infectious individuals (those who have contracted the disease and are able to spread it to others), and recovered individuals (who have some degree of immunity to the disease), together with a basic figure for the average of how many new infections you expect to get from a given original case in a completely susceptible population (this figure is called R0 or R-naught). At any given time the effective reproduction rate for the disease is then R0 times the percentage of susceptibles in the population. If this figure is above 1 then the disease will continue to spread. If it's below 1 then it will diminish.

You'll note that as a disease spreads it starts to face an uphill battle. While an infectious individual might expose many others to the disease, increasingly the people that are exposed have already been exposed and are now in fact immune because they have recovered. Once the population of immune (recovered) individuals has reached the point where the effective reproduction rate is below 1 per existing case, then the epidemic wanes. This happens when the percentage of recovered or immune is equal to 1 - 1/R0 and is called ""herd immunity"".

For example, say half the population is susceptible to an infection with an R0 of 10. That's an effective reproduction rate of 5, so 1 infection leads to 5 infections, which leads to 25, and then 125, etc. On the other hand, what if only 1 in 20 people are susceptible? That means 100 infections leads to 50 (10/20ths of the previous infections) then 25 then 12 then 6 then 3 then 1 then 0.

A ""green field"" epidemic where a highly infectious disease is introduced into an entirely susceptible population is the worst case scenario, but it's a situation that doesn't last. After a population becomes mostly immune and an epidemic disease wanes there will still be new susceptible individuals who continue to be exposed. Pockets of people who avoided exposure and newly born children. Children, however, will retain some degree of passive immunity from antibodies passed through breast milk from their mother, which gives them the opportunity to acquire active immunity when exposed to the disease without as much risk for becoming infected. This process isn't perfect though it does result in vastly decreased peak numbers of cases at any given time. What typically happens is that there will be a period of low infectivity where the population of susceptibles builds (through natural waning of immunity or more typically through births) up and the percentage of recovered/immune drops below the ""herd immunity"" level. Then a new exposure event will happen where a population without herd immunity will come into contact with the infectious disease again (from a human or animal reservoir, perhaps, or through migration/travel). Then there will be another mini-epidemic as the population goes from whatever state it was in up to herd immunity again. But because it didn't have as far to go this time the outbreak has a much lower peak.

Additionally, the massive die offs in Europe from the black plague enriched the population with a specific mutant version of the CCR5 gene (to around 10% from a level of about 2-5% in the original pre-plague population) which increased the natural resistance against plague (and today appears to confer a degree of resistance against the spread of HIV), which effectively lowered the effective reproduction rate for the plague in Europe and made epidemics as massive as the major plagues much less likely.

(Note: there's tons of detail and complexity I'm leaving out here, I'm just hitting the broad strokes.)

Europe continued to have various levels of plague up through the early 20th century. Several additional outbreaks/epidemics spread through the continent after the black plague, possibly additional strains where survival of the first strain did not give perfect immunity to the second (this is common with a lot of diseases) or simply mass outbreaks through newly susceptible populations. The later waves after the 14th century never had the same degree of spread as the first black death because the population was never so susceptible as then. It's hard to say how much policies like quarantining individuals, households, or villages had on later outbreaks, it's probably something but it's not nearly as significant as the ordinary infectious disease dynamics which have a tendency to burn themselves out and then cycle back and forth around the herd immunity line.",True,False,,0,1501562206,,False,0,dkzzkqd,False,t3_6qsqz1,t3_6qsqz1,1503660409,52,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,
Obligatory_tax_reply,,,"That comment is not delusional, but yours does sound a wee bit wonky. 

Cristiano is an amazing, tremendous player, but he hasn't won everything there is to win, and he is pretty much on par with Messi for trophies, individual and team. Portugal won the Euros, and Cristiano's goal got them into the finals, but you can't say he had an amazing performance in that tournament. Portugal only made it to the knockouts by luck of being the one of the best third-place teams. He got his team into the final, but he didn't play in most of it. I think Ronaldo deserves heaps of praise for what he did for Portugal, and there is no doubt they would not have been in the final without him, but to say that win proves him to be the greatest player in the history just sounds bizarre to me.

&gt;He ... is the greatest player in the CL history

Alfredo Di Stéfano might want a word with you about that... 

Also, Messi was phenomenal during the entire CL campaign for Barcelona in 2014/15. He tied for the most goals, and probably scored the most spectacular one of the tournament in the semi-final, but his greatest performances (in addition to that match in the semi) were probably against Manchester City at home and final when he didn't score a single goal himself. Messi was voted European player of the year by the largest margin for the award ever given after that year. From the beginning of the group stages to the last goal in the last minute of the final, Messi was involved in the wins and dominating games. I know people will be angered by this, but it is my opinion that Messi did just as well then as Cristiano did in this past one, particularly since he did so much through every stage. 

Messi has been the player with the most MOTM awards for every tournament he has been in since 2014, including the World Cup. He is the dominant player for a very good team (which could play even better, but that's another story).

And I am not even getting started on what Maradona did for Napoli that had never won anything, of what Cruyff did for football as a player and captain and how much he changed the game to be what it is today. I'm not saying I think Messi is the best player of all time, because I don't think that's true, but I do not follow your logic on how Cristiano is.

RSquared,,,"Consider that JUST the government-paid portion of US health care is of a similar cost per capita as most Euro-nations.  While it's possible that the US has sicker people, what's mostly happening is poor cost control.  The last two major health care bills - Medicare Part D and the ACA - had very very minor cost control measures and were mostly additional entitlements.  Medicare D was barred from negotiating drug prices, and instead gets the lowest available private price.  This is silly because Medicare eclipses all of those private entities in users, and could negotiate cheaper prices.  The ACA had some cost control measures, notably that 85% of insurance premiums MUST go to care, but largely left the market alone after regulating what must go in the policy - the minimum package/preexisting condition rules - and who must buy it - everyone.  The third leg of the stool, the premium subsidies, are rightly criticized for inflating premium costs because insurers know that their customers can pay base premium+subsidies...though this IS tempered by the 85% requirement!

The major problem is that things like MRIs are multiple thousands of dollars in the US and hundreds of dollars in Europe...due to oversupply.  Hospitals can always order more tests, use more equipment, etc, and their behavior is rewarded by the private insurance system.  Putting that under government regulation would be beneficial to the system.

Savolainen5,,Italy,"He's calling for me to comment. I've been teaching in Italy for a couple years now.

By and large, I agree with the other comment. I think you'll have a difficult time finding a job partially because you're not an EU citizen (this sounds crazy and I haven't confirmed it, but it also sounds very Italian - according to a coworker, an Italian is technically qualified to teach English with a B1 level, which makes it pretty hard for schools/companies to get work visas) and partially because of your lack of experience that would make you a really desirable candidate. I should note that I work for a pretty small language school that doesn't really have the resources to get work visas for its teachers, so all of the teachers are Italian or EU citizens. But larger schools may be more flexible.

Seeing your experience in the field, you might look into teaching English specifically for that field, which would involve looking at companies in that field. But for that they'll probably expect a CELTA or something. There's not a huge amount of activity in Italy in ONG, mining, and resources here, but there is some. Still, it seems like you could better leverage that experience outside of Italy.

I hate to sound a CELTA stooge, but it's probably your best bet given your citizenship (unless you can claim Italian citizenship through a parent or grandparent), since it's the most-respected in Europe. If you do go that route, International House and British Council are two good places to get it, as they can often give support in finding a job (and sometimes even hire those who finish their courses). Find a place to get a CELTA [here](http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/find-a-centre/find-a-teaching-centre/). Definitely ask them about your prospects of getting hired as a non-EU citizen, too.

Cortana_31415926,,,"I also believe it's important to keep an open mind even on topics against our own beliefs. However, I believe there are boundaries and lines that shouldn't be crossed. Racism is wrong. The genocide of millions of Jews is wrong. To debate that they are acceptable (unless in truly dire circumstances) and justify them is extremely dangerous to our society

We can debate all day long about what is objective and what is subjective. But let's also remember that debating about justifying Nazism is not just an academic hypothetical debate about philosophy and ideology; it leads to real consequences that endanger real people. 

For those who haven't been discriminated against before because of their race, debating about the right and wrongs of racism is purely an intellectual exercise. But for those who have experienced racism and fear of being killed simply because of their race, this debate is a tacit approval that it's okay for them to be discriminated against. If we put racism or Nazism on the same level as ideologies such as democracy or socialism - that they are simply other ideologies - and that they aren't ""bad"" and that they're okay for society, I think this is a step backwards for society and civil rights.

I guess what is socially acceptable vs not depends on the society.

[deleted],,,"Behind paywall, so copy/paste of article below:

&gt; Brexit will push up costs for banks by as much as 4 per cent and their capital requirements will rise up to 30 per cent, according to the most detailed assessment yet of what Britain’s departure from the EU means for the sector.

&gt; The findings by consultants Oliver Wyman will make grim reading for its bank clients, many of which are struggling with low profitability. They come a day after HSBC became the first lender to put a price tag on Brexit, saying the immediate disruption would cost it $200m-$300m.

&gt; Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of HSBC, said $1bn of revenue in its global banking and markets unit would be put “at risk” by Brexit. But he said it planned protect this revenue by moving up to 1,000 of its 6,000 UK investment banking jobs to France.

&gt; The pace of announcements about banks’ Brexit plans has picked up in recent weeks, partly because of pressure from the Bank of England for them to submit their plans for coping with the “worst-case scenario” of a hard Brexit, severing access to EU clients. The UK is set to leave the EU in March 2019.

&gt; Such plans are expected to cause duplication of resources and capital for large banks in Europe, Oliver Wyman warned. It said this may cause some banks to abandon some European activities altogether and shift resources to the US and Asia.

&gt; “At the moment what everyone is doing is planning to be able to continue doing what they already do after a hard Brexit,” said Matthew Austen, head of European corporate and institutional banking at Oliver Wyman.

&gt; “Once you have done that, if you have a strong performance in the US or Asia, then that is when you start to look at the post-Brexit foundations and it will prompt you to look at what the right business mix is,” he said.

&gt; The consultancy, which has access to detailed figures on almost every bank from the benchmarking work it does for the sector, estimated that 2 percentage points would be knocked off wholesale banks’ return on equity in Europe because of the disruption.

&gt; Wholesale banks — which serve corporate and institutional clients — would need to find $30bn-$50bn extra capital to support their new European operations, an increase of 15 to 30 per cent, it estimated. The industry’s annual costs would rise by $1bn, or 2 to 4 per cent.

&gt; “Any time you split a portfolio up — whether it be a credit portfolio or a trading book portfolio — you lose the benefits of diversification that allow you to reduce the capital you hold against it,” said Mr Austen.

&gt; Many banks have decided they cannot afford to wait for the political uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit negotiations to clear before implementing their plans and have started finding office space and applying for licences with regulators.

&gt; “Once everyone is back from this summer holidays, the annual planning process will really start in earnest and at that point people will start planning for next year’s costs and returns,” said Mr Austen.

&gt; “As you move into the back end of this year and the start of next year you have to start making those decisions. You would want to have moved people by next summer if they are going to get their kids into school in September.”

&gt; The consultancy stuck to the forecast it made last year that Brexit would drive 31,000-35,000 financial services jobs out of the UK, of which 12,000-17,000 would be in banking. In a worst-case scenario, in which euro clearing is shifted to the eurozone, banks could shift as many as 40,000 jobs out of the UK.",False,False,,0,1501566385,,False,0,dl01vej,False,t3_6qu9tx,t3_6qu9tx,1503661699,11,False,finance,t5_2qhfj,

Alirei,,,"While I believe you illustrated good points on multiple subjects, I would like to specifically focus on drones and the TS ban.

When you say ""gain allies,"" what exactly do you mean? I was under the assumption that all the allies that we could gain are already there. I mean we already have knowledge of all the superpowers, so it's not like we are about to get some random African nation emerging as the next superpower straight out of the blue. On the other hand, if some real stuff went down, I'm not sure if our allies would ever help us, and that doubt appeared way before Trump took office. Retention of allies is a different issue, but it's not exactly 100% on us to make that relationship work. England and France and Germany have been doing some hella counterproductive stuff with their refugees and that whole ""open borders"" bullshit. A question springs up into our minds as Germany is ruining Europe for the third time in a hundred years, how long before they become our enemies because they became Muslim nations? Asymmetrical warfare using drones is kind of the solution that I see. The thing is that the situation has changed since Obama left office. We had more guys on the ground there, so using drones was just generally odd when we can just rain some phosphorous with mortars from like a mile away. Now that we have dramatically decreased the presence of troops, the drones basically have to come back or we send guys like yours truly back in. I mean I kind of volunteered to go with those marines as a comms guy in the field to pad my resume and while it's been a blast, going back there means that at least a hundred thousand are going back in. Personally speaking, even when I'm there I have to go out of my way to get killed, so even when we are all knee deep in the shit, I am still squeaky clean compared to the other guys because of the nature of my work. Long story short is some of our boys are going to inevitably die, it's just how war rolls. Couldn't care less for whomever is on the business end of the gun, but I care about our guys and girls enough that I don't want us to go back.

Okay so we already know I am active duty Navy. Let's talk about team dynamics, or rather having females in combat or just in the general military workforce. Somehow we decided it was a good idea to diversify our workplace in combat and to be perfectly honest it was among the dumbest decisions I have ever witnessed. I mean machinery couldn't give less of a damn what hangs between your legs so long as you can turn that wrench. Combat is a different story entirely. Army did this thing where they tested different units, an all female, an all male and mixed. They ran these units through a crucible or three and it turns out that the all-male unit outperformed the mixed unit and the mixed unit outperformed the all-female unit, and the reason for the latter is mainly because of the men. This is why special programs heavily discriminate against females, no matter what happens, they will be the weakest link because of the way that basic biology works and because of how people are built. I mean, just go ahead and find me a girl that can put on full combat load then pick me up in my full combat load (250+ lbs and another 30 if wearing comms backpack) and then carry me to cover that is 50 yards away. No stopping, have to run in a crouched fashion and no dropping weapons. I didn't have a lady in my marine unit that could do that, nor is there one on my ship. The Israeli got a nifty solution tot his, they segregate their units by gender and as it turns out, the ladies have no real trouble picking up each other. We however will never have enough female volunteers in our special programs so it makes no sense to mix units because the primary population of the units is against female inclusion. If this makes the unit bigoted, but effective, then so be it. You have to have unit cohesion for the magic to happen. You can draw these exact same parallels to the TS community. Sure, may be called bigoted, but we are good at our jobs and the government has no business distracting us with a social experiment. Honestly, marrying just for the BAH is just morally wrong, and while it happens, it does not make it alright. As far as GI bill goes, I think joining the military to further your education is a good idea.

Cafj,,🐸 ,"THE Australian soccer players’ union report has savaged the A-League’s lack of faith in young players but Adelaide United is bucking the trend.

Players under 21 made up less than 10 per cent of the total games played last season which is worrying.

But Adelaide last season had eight players under 21 — headlined by Ben Garuccio — who played in Guillermo Amor’s campaign.

Reds chairman Greg Griffin says Adelaide is deliberately focusing on youth and improving its scouting network with plans of being a key gateway club.

The Reds plucked Riley McGree and Jordan O’Doherty from outside of Football Federation SA’s pathways program. And Griffin said United’s new coach Marco Kurz was continuing to keep faith in young players.

Kurz is demanding young players — and his senior men — train harder and more frequently than they have been in the past.

The German has called for at least three daily double sessions a week in a bid to get his players up to the higher demands of European soccer should any of his stock be given a chance.

“If young players get to go to Europe they’ll be ready to meet the very high demands,’’ said the former German Bundesliga 1 and 2 coach and 299 games veteran.

“We do have good young talent. Aan example is Pacifique Niyongabire who was given a chance in the NPL team after he trialled last year,’’ Griffin said. “We’ve also had trials in June for a squad of 16 under-16 players for the Zibo Birthplace Cup in October in China where we will play clubs like Atletico Madrid, Arsenal and the Chinese national team. It’s paid for and it’s another wonderful opportunity to see if these young players can take the next step.”

Professional Footballers Australia 2016/17 A-League on Monday released its report which showed Garuccio made 27 appearances, the most amount of games for a young A-League player.

Socceroo McGree, 18, played 17 games for Adelaide before signing for Belgium’s Club Brugge last month and 19-year-old O’Doherty also played 17 Reds games.

Brisbane Roar led the youth stakes with nine players under 21. Sydney FC was the worst performer with just three players.

Adelaide last season also gave valuable game time to Mark Ochieng, 20, gloveman Daniel Margush, 19, current triallist Marc Marino, 21, and former Red George Mells, 20.

The quartet played 24 games collectively.",True,False,,0,1501571058,,False,0,dl03zrh,True,t3_6qulbc,t3_6qulbc,1503662763,1,False,AdelaideUnited,t5_2x3zo,

IgnatiusCorba,centipede,CENTIPEDE!,"Oh god it is really bad to see just how thorough the left wing infiltration of the education system has been.

Anyway, there are a lot of issues at play here. First of all the word left-wing and right-wing have no direct meaning as such.  Europe has had no history of freedom like America has, so their idea of right wing is just the thing that opposed the left, and in Europe that was simply a different kind of socialism.  Back then the right wing in America today were called ""liberals"", today we call them ""classical liberals"", I'll get to why in a minute.

In Europe the word originates from the French revolution, with the right being the old aristocracy of lords and kings ...etc, and the left being the socialists (a.k.a communists).  During Hitlers time, the aristocracy sided with the national socialists (a.k.a Nazis) because they had conservative social values (the communists were like the pussy hat wearing dildo wielding left of today).  This is opposite to the US where conservatives represent the original values of the Republic (i.e, Christianity and classical liberalism).  In Europe, both the left and right were socialists who wanted welfare and government ownership and control of the businesses.

The Nazi party itself was a broad group, but the most insanely violent were the furthest to the left.  These guys were called the Strasserists and their thugs were called the storm troopers.  They would attend the political rallies of all their opponents and beat the shit out of them.  Their number one enemy were the filthy capitalists.  They were exactly the same as Antifa today in every way.

Some quotes from prominent Nazis may make this more clear:

&gt;“We are socialists, we are enemies of today’s capitalistic economic system for the exploitation of the economically weak, with its unfair salaries, with its unseemly evaluation of a human being according to wealth and property instead of responsibility and performance, and we are all determined to destroy this system under all conditions.”
—Adolf Hitler,1927 speech 

&gt;On “the money pigs of capitalist democracy”: “Money has made slaves of us. “Money is the curse of mankind. It smothers the seed of everything great and good. Every penny is sticky with sweat and blood.”
—Joseph Goebbels,1929 

&gt;“‘Private property’ as conceived under the liberalistic economic order … represented the right of the individual to manage and to speculate with inherited or acquired property as he pleased, without regard for the general interests … German socialism had to overcome this ‘private,’ that is, unrestrained and irresponsible view of property. All property is common property. The owner is bound by the people and the Reich to the responsible management of his goods. His legal position is only justified when he satisfies this responsibility to the community.”
—Ernst Rudolf Huber, official Nazi Party spokesman, 1939 

The entire Democratic platform for the last 70 years has been based on FDRs new deal.  This was a direct application of fascist doctrine.  FDR was completely open about his good relations with Mussolini and how the new deal was an attempt to model the USA on fascist italy.

anyway...

After WWII, socialism had a pretty bad rap and liberalism (or ""classical liberalism"") had won the day for the whole world, so the Democrats relabeled themselves as ""social liberals"".  They kept all the fascist economic policies, but went for drugs and sex and stuff.  This was just evil rebranding itself and trying to rope in the young ones with offers of sex and drugs.  Because the left has always been the masters of propaganda and word play, they eventually managed to rebrand the conservatives and liberals as the right-wing, because they opposed the left-wing (and also because the right wing in Europe was connected with the conservatives there, so the wording kind of stuck).  Also, they managed to take over the word liberal, because the conservatives in the US were so opposed the left that they changed names to make sure people understood the difference, eventually they went to calling their kind of liberalism ""classical liberalism"" to differentiate it from the new kind of liberalism the left had created.

Da, stiu si ei ca nu au cum... numai ca bugetul actual este super-optimistic din toate puncturile de vedere, deci se preconizeaza ca totul merge perfect, si mai bine decat perfect, inclusiv absorbtia fondurilor eurpene.... altfel nu prea ies cifrele, ca sunt bugetate niste cheltuieli imense.
2. Se face asta intotdeauna, ministerul/guvernul este criticat pentru absorbtia fondurilor europene, desi nu neaparat e de vina. La fel, daca se semneaza un contract pentru o mare investitie, atunci guvernul actual se mandreste ca ""uite, sunt aici de 2 luni si deja am facut asta"" ... Ministerul actual se duce si da un speech, ca ""vai ce eficient este sistemul decand am ajuns eu aici""... Eu nu zic sa nu criticati pe guvern sau ministerul fondurilor europene, oricine ar fi... eu zic ca nu ajuta... de asta am si scris ce am scris, articolele din astea nu ajuta... creaza isterie, forteaza schimbari care nu sunt necesare... exemplu concret, cand PSD-ul si-a creat criza guvernamentala, statau proiecte finalizate (gata pentru contractare) pe banca ministerului... numai ca nimeni nu indraznea sa-le semneze.
Daca schimbi un minister, sistemul nu va functiona mai bine instantaneu... Ca oricum nu ministerul face ce trebuie facut... in schimb asta creaza incertitudine, si se blocheaza procesele... functinoarii sunt speriati pentru joburile lor, nu se semneaza contractele, organismele intermediare nu indraznesc sa dea raspunsuri definitive, ca sunt speriati si ei ca poate in 2 saptamani se va schimba sistemul...

PL clubs, like the vast majority of football clubs, aren't particularly profitable. Vast amounts are invested in facilities, wages, transfer fees etc. Creating a cartel to limit competition, as the MLS has done, is really the only way to make a significant level of profit 

&gt;They're the only reason the league still exists and is growing, we tried the whole no salary cap thing and the NASL died because of it. Turns out it's pretty hard to create a popular league around a countries 5th most popular sport. 

You've really ignored my point. I'm aware a salary cap adds stability but it also means Schweinsteiger's comment is complete bollocks. Making MLS as good as Serie A in 10 years will mean attracting some of Europe's best players on a consistent basis and that just won't happen without paying Chinese level transfer fees and wages, even then it's very difficult

Can't say for everyone but personally I don't regret. Can't say it felt repetitive because when watching first time you don't pay attention for a lot of details, especially in first slow part of the show. 

Beauty of S;G is that it's time travel story/mechanic is done right(as much as it can be), it strictly sets it's rules and is following them from beginning to the end and because of that it pretty much has no plotholes.

Also another interesting aspect for me is style of storytelling. If you noticed, 99% the story is told only from perspective of Okabe. We are confused same way as he is, we know as much as he do and we don't see any behind the scenes of what is really happening, there are a lot of clues that are foreshadowing events from the first episode. For a moment just remember episode 1 and 23.

Also if you don't know, main event's of S;G are based of real world popular conspiracy theories.

John Titor is not just fictional character created in S;G, main events and S;G mechanic is based on real life John Titor.

- Some museums are even totally free, like Paris Museum of Modern Art or the permanent collection of Petit Palace. Maybe for next time, the largest number of free museums and galleries I've seen in Europe is in London, that's a treat.
- Research public transport and try getting multi-day passes/travel cards. Single tickets in both Paris and Brussels are expensive.
- Shop in supermarkets, stock your AirBnB fridges with food for both breakfast and dinners. Shop in large chain supermarkets like Carrefour rather than small convenience stores.
- Going out at night will be expensive, clubs are the most expensive places to go to. Drinking anything there is pricy. So as was already suggested, do some pre-game or limit yourself to one beer/glass of wine.
- Research cheap street food beforehand so you'll know your options.

And one tip of what NOT to do, because I've seen this shown so many times as a way to save money:
- DON'T take a free tour (such as Sandeman's New Europe tours) and then proceed to not give your guide any kind of tip. Free tours are not free, they're tip-based and the guides have to pay marketing fee of 2 or 3 euros per each person that started the tour, so in the end, they'll end up losing money because of that.

Jaqqarhan,,,"&gt;So you're against an ideology that advocates for the value of the average citizen

I'm against an ideology that advocates using hatred and lies to stir up the ignorant masses into supporting authoritarian demagogues. That's what populism is. It's mostly part of the far-right, but it can sometimes be part of the far-left like the current government in Venezuela. Either way, it always ends in misery and death for the ignorant masses that support their populist demagogues. People are now literally starving in Venezuela despite the massive oil wealth, and hundreds of people are being murdered in the street by the Venezuelan government. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/venezuela-populism-fail/525321/ The Khmer Rouge in Cambodia is another great example of left wing populism in action. They murdered all of the elites (educated people) to create a populist country ruled entirely by the common man. They were soon starving to death because the elites they murdered were the only people that knew how to keep them alive. We know how right-wing populism turned out in Europe in the 1930s/40s with tens of millions slaughtered, and now the right-wing populists are back in power in Hungary and Poland.

&gt;I'm saying that a Democrat with a similar basic platform and skill at conveying it and how we would care for the common man better (populism) is the key to the success of our party

I'm saying that I will do everything in my power to fight anyone that advocates populism in the Democratic Party. I care about the success of the human race, not the Democratic Party. As I have already said repeatedly, I would much rather have the Democratic party fail and be destroyed than have it succeed by becoming a populist party that destroys the country.

&gt; Nobody has to lie to agree that caring about ordinary people and good communication are essential to being successful in politics

No, you definitely have to lie or at least be deluding yourself if you seriously believe that. Trump is a textbook narcissist who has made it very clear he doesn't care one bit about ordinary people, and he was very successful in politics. Caring about ordinary people is definitely not essential or even useful in politics, especially populist politics.

...

&gt;uh, uh, uh

Except I'm not fishing. This is all very well documented. It just doesn't fit your narrative.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics#Sweden

&gt;A frequently cited source when comparing Swedish rape statistics internationally is the regularly published report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), based on official statistics provided by each member state.[note 1] In 2012, Sweden had 66 cases of reported rapes per 100,000 population, according to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (Brå).[238] This was unequivocally the biggest number reported to the UNODC in 2012.[239] **However, widely differing legal systems, offence definitions, terminological variations, recording practices and statistical conventions makes any cross-national comparison on rape statistics difficult,[240][241][242][243] which is why the UNODC itself caution against using their figures.[239] It should also be noted that many countries do not report any rape statistics at all to the UNODC,[244] and some report very low numbers, despite studies that indicate otherwise.[245][246]**

&gt;**The Swedish police record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately, leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries.[240][243][247] Sweden also has a comparatively wide definition of rape.[240][241][242] This means that more sexual crimes are registered as rape than in most other countries.[241] For example, in 2005 Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider,[240][248][249][250] which led to a marked increase in reports.[251][252] Additionally, the Swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases, in an effort to decrease the number of unreported cases.[240][252][253][254]** For this reason, large-scale victimisation surveys have been presented by criminologists as a more reliable indicator of rape prevalence.[240][241][242] An EU-wide survey on sexual violence against women, published by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) in 2014, showed Sweden was only third highest, below Denmark and Finland[255] and a previous assessment by Brå have placed Sweden at an average level among European nations.[241]

&gt;**According to the FRA study there's a strong correlation between higher levels of gender equality and disclosure of sexual violence.[255] This, and a greater willingness among Swedish women to report rape in relationships,[256] may also explain the relatively high rates of reported rape in Sweden, which has a long-standing tradition of gender equality policy and legislation, as well as an established women's movement,[242] and has been ranked as the number one country in sex equality.[243][257]**

Turns out when you define more sexual abuse as rape than basically any other country does, actively fight for victims to come forward and feel safe and supported in doing so, and count a year's worth of a man's crimes against his wife as tens to hundreds of different rapes when most other countries would treat them as one, you end up with higher numbers. Imagine that. It's like you're aren't comparing like to like. It's like you're slamming Sweden for baring everything and taking a hard line against sexual abuse while in the U.S. we know police departments are cooking their books to meet crime reduction quotas. 

And as I've already pointed out, *most rapes in Sweden are committed by people who live with or are otherwise close to their victims.* So this idea that immigrants are going around raping white Swedes is silly. Even the ""Conservative Bible,"" National Review had to acknowledge as much, knowing full well they'd get hissy fits from people like you.

&gt;Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

You're certainly doing a lot of that, yes.

nomnommish,,5∆,"Many of your points such as welfare, education, healthcare - are services that are offerred to all citizens. It is not a special service only offered to minorities. As such, it is only an indicator of a wealthier and more socialist society, not an indicator of a society that treats minorities especially well.

Your logic is similar to, ""Western countries have better roads and infrastructure, minorities get to use this better infrastructure along with everyone else, and hence minorities are treated better in Western countries.

This is wrong logic. You can only prove this if you can prove that non Western countries do not let minorities use the social infrastructure as their other majority citizens. In other words, they treat them worse, relatively speaking.

Point 2. You have done a lot of cherrypicking. I will take India's example. India has had a very long history of assimilating minorities into its society and is a very tolerant society as well. You also have to take into account that it is a far more populous country, far denser country in terms of population density, far poorer country. Most importantly, it has far more diversity than most Western European countries.

The reality is, Western European countries are only superficially tolerant of minorities because it has never become a big enough issue for them. They are wealthy, lead fairly insular lives, and their lives really do not get affected when they take in small measured quantities of minorities in controlled doses as acts of generosity.

Challenges with minority, diversity, religious beliefs etc only become true challenges when people are jostling each other constantly for limited resources, limited cultural space.

When cultural pactices are constantly intruding on your daily lives. When you have a dozen mosques in your immediate neighborhood all blaring the namaaz call 5 times a day. While you also have a dozen Hindu temples that blast religious songs on loudspeaker during festivals. While you also have roads blocked off because of observed Christian festivals and processions.

And you have to deal with all this while you have to scramble for work nwxt morning when you are a daily wage earner earning peanuts and have to take overcrowded public transportation, again jostling hundreds of people from all walks of life and all religions and ethinicities.

This is a far cry from the peace and quiet you enjoy in your hermetic Ikea home while you get to work in clockwork precision and tidiness. And more importantly, the immigrants and minorities do not disturb your daily bliss at all.

So of course you can be generous and benrvolent. But consider the chaos and poverty. Consider that a population of 1.2 billion people crammed into megacities, and with the second largest Muslim population in the world (more Muslims than probably the entire middle east) still live fairly peacefully. My point is, put it in the right context. No denying the religious riot that happened in 2002, but also note there have been no religious issues after that as well. And that too under the rule of the same political party.

If anything, India's laws aggressively protect minorities. Minorities in India have full access to the social infrastructure as others. Mosques and churches and gurudwaras and zoroastrian fire temples and synagogues coexist quite peacefully with Hindu temples, even in extremely crowded urbanized cities.

Minorities also vote equally and in most cases are more aggressive politically and get their minority candidates voted who also safeguards their interests and rights.

Despite being a contentious isssue, India's laws for minorities are far more sophisticated and evolved compared to most Western European countries. Personal law and marital law for example is tailor made to respect and protect  minority religions. Hindu personal law for example is very different from Muslim personal law which is dfferent from Christian personal law. There are religious law board that provide advice and feedback to courts and government on all religious and personal law issues.

If you look at any population running into billions, you will likely be able to cherry pick the worst that humanity has to offer. But consider looking at the totality including the enormity of the challenge, and how vastly more complex this challenge is for a country like India. And do remember, it is only when you are scrabbling daily to eke out a living, when you are competing for extremely limited resources in an overcrowded society - when all the ugliness, all the clannisness and tribalism, all the xenophobia rises to the top. 

Just look at how little it took for the alt-right movement, the xenophobia, the Muslim hate, the Brexit, to kick in.

DaveB44,,,"I've made connections in both Europe &amp; the US. There are pros &amp; cons to both.

Whichever way you do it you will have to go through immigration, pick your bags, go through customs &amp; recheck your bags (immigration's the bit that takes time, customs is just a walk-through unless you're unlucky/suspicious-looking!) at your port of entry into the US. If you make the connection in Europe delays at immigration won't mean that you run the risk of missing your connecting flight.

You do, however, have factor in the possibility of your first flight arriving late causing you to miss your connecting flight. The airline will book you onto the next available flight, but as your transatlantic flight may well be the only one that day between the two airports involved things can get complicated. On the other hand there will probably be numerous flights from your US hub airport to your final destination.

A couple of examples from personal experience:

Manchester-Frankfurt-Houston with Lufthansa. First flight delayed because Frankfurt had closed a runway because of high winds &amp; heavy rain. We were rebooked via Denver, which meant a longer transatlantic flight, a rush through immigration, etc, at Denver (did it in 35 min!) &amp; a third flight from Denver to Houston; the result of all that was that we arrived 8 hours late in Houston.

Manchester-Atlanta-Dallas with Delta. On arriving at Manchester airport we were greeted with ""It's running an hour &amp; a half late, but you've been rebooked on a later connecting flight"". Strong headwinds across the Atlantic meant that we were going to miss our rebooked connecting flight, so we were automatically rebooked on a later flight. After all that we arrived two hours late. On arrival at Atlanta we were told that they could get us onto an earlier flight to Dallas which was, in fact, the first flight we'd been rebooked on which had been delayed. . . never had so many boarding cards for one simple trip!

Of your options for a connecting airport I'd choose Amsterdam - I'd also choose a Delta-operated flight over over one operated by Virgin! If you do decide to make the connection in the US consider going via Atlanta - it's big, but efficient.

We try to fly non-stop whenever possible. It's more expensive, but there's no hassle with connecting flights &amp; the overall journey time is substantially less.

British citizens moved to other countries aware that they were going to have to abide by the rules of that country.  If you go to Australia and they suddenly say ""No, fuck off."" then you went knowing that there was nothing the UK could do about it. 

We agreed a reciprocal system with other EU countries that we'd guarantee their rights through the use of international courts, so that Spain couldn't suddenly decide that they were no longer allowed to live there.

It is true though. You think that because you do not get how. No gypsies do not steal other people babies and force them to beg. 
Clans take the kids of the members of the clans and force them to beg. Yes the kids go back to their families but those kids are forced to beg. Sometimes those kids are taken to EU countries and forced to beg there

Like, a general league game goes with AD+ support bot, Mage/Assasin mid, Bruiser/Tank toplane, and someone in the jungle.

This pattern emerged after one of the first international tournaments, where EU beat NA using this strat. (At the time, NA was instead using a roamer, instead of a support botlane)

This was then accepted over time as ""The"" way to play. If you were the last to pick, and your team 'didn't a support, it would be expected that you pick one. and if instead, you wanted to double jungle or whatever, people tended to rage at you.

Riot for quite a while, was really evasive about it, and would design their champs often without a clear role in mind. with the mentality of ""players will figure it out"", this was really hit or mis and some champs like Karma, were virtually unplayed for years.

But after a some time that the Meta didn't deviate from that standard even once (except a very brief stint when a gold income item was super overpowered), they went ""Fuck it, guess its here to say"" and started designing champs clearly intent for jungle, or Top lane, or as support, and they implemented role selection in the que, so you could que up as a top laner, instead of fighting it out in champ select. 

So if you wanted to switch up the meta now, by doing someting like triple mid, that would be really hard to get going in a soloQ game, so in that way, its been enforced.

There is already an ample supply of European citizens wanting to become airline pilots within the EU, so you won't get sponsorship for a visa. When you hear about ""pilot shortages"" what it really means is there are 20 qualified applicants for each job, rather than 200.

If you do have the right to work in the EU, some European airlines (for instance BA) have ab-initio training programmes that will take you from zero to Airbus FO (or nearly zero). However, competition for these programmes is strong: I have a friend who did it, and on his intake there were roughly **one thousand** applicants for each open position. Most obviously got rejected before even making it to the aptitude test, let alone the interview. The airline has the luxury of only picking the most outstanding candidates when the intake is so oversubscribed (and this shows why you're not going to get sponsored for a visa by an airline employer!)

Having a fair few hours of GA flying in both the US and Europe, unless you have an overriding non-aviation desire to live in Europe - for instance, you love a EU country's culture or language, and aviation is just secondary to this - then stay in the USA, the aviation scene is much more vibrant.

Sierrahun,,,"That's hardly the place to make deep historical arguments, but I list some of my views briefly.  

1) Austria wasn't weaker than Hungary, even with another war going on the italian front at the same time. They were not able to conquer all of the Kingdom of Hungary as long as the Russian intervention kicked in, but they maintained possession of the certain parts of the country from November 1848 til May 1849. The war without the Russian intervention was as good as a stalemate at that time, neither participant was able to win. Hungary had hardly any war industry, it had to be created basicly from thin air and the (by that time seemingly temporary) loss of the capitol Buda affected the fledgling arms manufacturing deeply. It had to be relocated time and again and after the retaking of Royal Castle of Buda (May 1849)  the deceison was made to bring it back to the capitol city (well, twin city that time, Pest). In conclusion Hungarian arms manufacturing never affectively produced arms after December 1848. The replacing of rifles, ammunition and powder would have been impossible for months and the next invasion of Haynau was imminent. The forces were more or less even and Hungarian moral was supreme, but Austrian regiments were supreme regarding arms, discipline and doctrines. The leadership was more or less even. Austria pacified Italy by that time and Hungary pacified majority of Transylvania and the majority of Délvidék (that's what today is part of Serbia). We made agreements with some Rumanian militia elements but majority of Rumanians disliked Hungarians on the average and wanted to side with Vienna. That time their resistance were mainly crushed. Current Slovakia (Felvidék, Upper Hungary) was more or less in a boat with us, they did not resist the Hungarian army and could be described as benevolent or sympathetic to our cause (they saw it as a common advantage over the status quo ante) or at least neutral towards it. Croatia was in open revolt, siding with Austria. The saxons in Transylvania stiffly resisted us. Ruthenia (East Karpathian mountains) and the jewish minority was on the Hungarian side. Some German and Polish nationalists came to support the Revolution too. 

2) But the decisive factor was European approach to the question of 1848. And it was a mainly conservative approach. There were 6 great powers in Europe that time. **Austria** most certainly would not like to cede its territory. **Turkey** was benevolently neutral towards the Hungarian revolt. They naturally wanted to see it succeed but they were far to weak to intervene on our behalf so stayed put. The **Kingdom of Prussia** wasn't sympathetic to this idea of making a revolution at all. They were happy Vienna had troubles and infuriated German public opinion by cracking down on a nationalist uprising but they could not side with such a movement either because it can turn against the ruler very quickly and so the king refused the crown offered by the nationalist Parliament of Frankfurt. They knew accepting it would only have infuriated everybody else and would have pitted them against Prussia as nobody was enthusiastic about a united Germany. **France** would have been very happy to see the overturning of the European status quo, especially by a nationalist force that had no issue with France at all and looked for leadership and guidance to Paris. But they knew that as soon as Paris makes the slightest move they can fully expect a new Napoleonic war and the last one did not end well for them. It had been a disaster and put them in isolation. The **United Kingdom** had no use of anything that even remotly reminded them to Napoleonic principles (nationalism), even less with a relative of Napoleon climbing back on top of France in 1848 (the later crowned Emperor Napoleon III). Had Hungary been closer to London they would have intervened themselves. We weren't close, so they did the next best thing: let the Russians do that for them. Lord Palmerstone told the Russian ambassador: ""finish them off quickly!"" And **Russia** was glad to get more influence in Europe especially eyeing the Balkans which it desired to annex. Tzar Nicholas was a conservative ruler, shed no tears about extirpating nationalism because it wasn't Russian and the doctrine of the sanctity of the reigning ruler - well it reigned supreme and trumped all other arguments.

This just about decided the war. Russia in 1812-1815 handled 600.000 attacking European soldiers alone, drove them off her land, handled another about 600.000 joined by Austria and Prussia and was able to send, reinforce and supply her own army as far west as Paris. A fledgeling, badly armed and badly supplied Hungarian army of 150.000 alltogether was no match to the mighty Russian army.  

3) Your argument about Croatia being slavic was not sufficent to deter Nicholas I. Panslavism was always means to get influence, support, cooperation etc. from nations on the Balkan-peninsula, but never ends. The aim was always to maintain Russian dominance. And even when they ruled Poland (a slavic country) by constitutional means (so without much of oppression, and therefore it could be described as being panslavic instead of Russian imperialism) until 1830-31, the result was polish revolution by polish nationalism in order to reestablish the polish nationalist Poland. There were another two polish uprisings in 1846 and 1848. The pacification of Poland was a lasting issue for Russia and polish patriots were flocking to Hungary in late 1848 just to fight authoritarian rulers of the world wherever they could. We had 3 polish generals in our ranks. One of them, Jozef Bem is a national hero in Hungary, Wysocki is lesser known but he was a good corps commander and Henrik Dembinski is well known as one of the the leaders of the 1830 polish revolt, but generally despised as incompetent (in Hungary). Russia saw no ally in any nationalist movement in Europe since Napoleon.  

4) There would have been a certain effect had Croatia joined Hungary in 1848, but it would came in 1867 with the Austro-Hungarian Compromise. That would have been extended fully to a Austro-Hungarian-Croatian compromise for sure. Hungarians wouldn't have been happy with it, cause that time they saw themselves as in possession of the Croatian crown so the personal union of the rulers of Hungary and Croatia was kinda as ""sacred"" as the the authocracy to Russian Tzars. Nevertheless some kind of compromise would have been made, so it would led to some kind of trialism. But it came close ti de facto trialism anyway in 1867 and Croatia was way too small to save the Austro-Hungarian-Croatian Empire anyway so it would have made no lasting effect on history.",True,False,,0,1501581984,,1501588848,0,dl08259,False,t3_6qdbwz,t1_dkzm4mq,1503664902,2,False,hungary,t5_2qzzt,

&gt; * In The Guardian, Natalie Nougayrede argues that ""as the U.S. and EU square off over Russia sanctions, only Putin can win.""

&gt; * Marc Bennetts, author of the book Im Going To Ruin Their Lives: Inside Putins War On Russias Opposition, has a piece in Politico looking inside Aleksei Navalny's long-shot presidential campaign and profiling his chief of staff, Aleksei Volkov.

&gt;* The Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) announced at the end of July that Airbus Defence and Space (Germany and Spain), Dassault (France) and Leonardo (Italy) have decided on a twin-turboprop configuration for the new unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), ahead of further studies under the Systems Requirements Review (SRR) phase of the programme.

&gt;* Work to develop the European MALE RPAS (formerly referred to as MALE2020) formally commenced in September 2016 with a definition phase focusing on common operational capabilities, top-level technical requirements, the overall system, design, and the future MALE RPAS development and production effort.

Ad_Captandum_Vulgus,,,"I think the question is flawed -- in many salient ways, the states, and later state, of Italy were and did become major powers on the world stage -- up to and including the modern day, in which Italy is the prime mover in the founding of the European Union, and by many measures the 7th largest economy in the world (larger than Russia, Brazil or India). 

But, let's start at the beginning. I'll skim over the Roman Republic/Empire as you've acknowledged in your question the primacy of Italy for an enormous period of antiquity. But that means we've got the year 476 (the traditional, though somewhat arbitrary, date of the 'fall of the Western Roman Empire') until today to look at, and see what Italy and its various states have accomplished.

So! First things first, we have to consider just who might reasonably be deemed to be 'Italian' -- for example, the Lombards who settled in Italy and formed an iteration of the Kingdom of Italy: Shall we consider them to be an Italian state, or an occupying force? It's hard to tell, as often as not the 'invaders' from the lands on the periphery of the Roman Empire were Latinized and Romanized to a significant extent. In this context it's perhaps salient that most of the time and with most of the semi-Germanic tribes who eventually came to call Italy home and the kingdom theirs, there was a blurring of distinctions on whether they were Roman or not. But I'm digressing a bit.

If we take a wide view of 'Italy' as a political force, it's basically been the central theatre for nearly all of European history. Great powers of their day, like the Lombard Kingdom of Italy, could be considered the earliest iterations of power related to a 'state' of Italy after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

Then there are the more curious examples in the early middle ages -- Charlemagne's Carolingian Empire, and then the Holy Roman Empire, for example. 

The Carolingian Empire included areas that are primarily today Germany, France and Italy (along with Belgium, Switzerland etc.) -- but notably, the largest city in the empire was Rome, and Charlemagne was explicitly crowned emperor in Rome by the Pope. So in a real way, Italy as a socio-cultural-political unit was a fundamental factor in the realization of great-power status for Charlemagne.

The same is then true of the Holy Roman Empire -- and though the oft-quoted quip about it being 'neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire' is in the popular imagination, it's mostly stuck around because it's a funny aside, and not because it's particularly accurate. It WAS an empire, though with varying degrees of imperial power throughout its existence, and in 962 when Otto is crowned the Holy Roman Emperor it is explicitly to capitalize on Charlemagne's, and thus Rome's legacy.

So the HRE becomes another state that is integrally partially Italian and partially German -- culturally and socially, it's again important to note that some of the largest cities in the HRE are Bologna, Rome, Florence, et cetera, and not just Frankfurt and the German cities, though they were large too.

But you could argue all of these are a stretch, perhaps -- indeed, I think most historians would balk at calling the Holy Roman Empire an Italian state, as in many/most ways, it really wasn't. 

We can certainly, however, find Italian kingdoms/states/governments/polities that have great-power status throughout the Middle Ages. The most obvious are naturally the Maritime Republics -- Venice and Genoa foremost, though others like Pisa and Amalfi not insignificant.

To say Venice was a Mediterranean superpower in the 1000-1300 period is, I think, not overstating the case. Venice was one of Europe's largest and most cosmopolitan cities, and presided over a large maritime empire stretching from what is now Russia/Ukraine to Africa to Greece to Lebanon, and of course its Terrafirma land empire in Italy. Venice's impact on the world is really hard to overestimate, in my view -- from facilitating the Crusades, to spreading the Black Death, to sacking Constantinople and indirectly bringing about the fall of the Byzantine Empire to capturing early European exploratory sentiment with the travels of one of Venice's most famous sons, Marco Polo. Genoa gets a bit of short-shrift in all this, possibly only because the city of Venice itself is (frankly) way cooler, but Genoa also has enormous impact on the world stage, from ferrying the Ottomans into Greece, to basically founding mercantilism/capitalism and the banking system -- not to mention an equally exploratory spirit, personified by Genoa's answer to Marco Polo in Christopher Colombus (who I daresay had something of an impact on the world too).

There were other powers in Italy beyond the maritime republics, though, that had huge influence in the world -- the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, for one, which led the charges on the Crusades literally and figuratively, and acted as counter-balance to the Holy Roman Empire's attempts to bring the Papal States to heel. They even briefly turned Palermo into one of Europe's richest, most learned and most cosmopolitan capitals.

Then we come to the Renaissance, which you've already mentioned, and so I'll gloss over -- but suffice it to say that the adage that the Renaissance 'rescued the world from darkness' is, while not perhaps accurate or nuanced, at least a good indicator of the importance this period has had on our collective civilization's memory. Powers like Florence under the Medicis, Rome under the Renaissance Popes, and Milan, Sienna, Pisa, Verona, Padua, etc. all had vastly outsize effects on the world, from architecture to art to cuisine to engineering to military invention and beyond. 

Part and parcel with the Renaissance, we get into a period where Italy is particularly fractured and tormented -- the infamous Italian Wars. Even here, though, it's hard to think of Italy as being a backwater; even during the periods of strife, it remained a dynamo of great individuals to make their name on the world stage, from the aforementioned Christopher Colombus to Leonardo da Vinci and all of the other famous names you've heard.

Now, perhaps, we get to the heart of your question -- so what about in the age of empire? Well, it's true, Italy is a latecomer to the stage, because it was so fractured. But the Kingdom of Sardinia, which isn't really very well-named as it was mainly the rich, industrial, powerful provinces of Northern Italy and the Po Plain like Milan, Turin and Genoa (plus Sardinia, admittedly), does participate as one of the 'lesser of the Great Powers' in the 19th century. Napoleon (another son of Italy by many reckonings, gone on to greatness in foreign service) had created his Kingdom of Italy satellite state, and while this didn't long outlast him, it did crystallize the momentum the House of Savoy of the Kingdom of Sardinia gained. Within a few decades of Napoleon's defeat, the Kingdom of Sardinia is participating in the Crimean War alongside Britain and France, as well as several wars against the Hapsburg empire. 

These movements culminate in the Risorgimento, which sees the unification of Italy and such fascinating figures as Garibaldi, Cavour and Victor-Emmanuel. Is this 'great power'? Well, it was considered so by the other European states of the time; Bismarck, Napoleon III and the hapless Hapsburgs all reckoned on Italy as a major power in the new balance in Europe. Italy during this period also continued its tradition of supplying the world with exceptional individuals -- the radio, for example, is developed by Guglielmo Marconi in 1895, the telephone is arguably creditable to Antonio Meucci in 1870, the battery to Alessandro Volta, and on. 

Europe also generally perceived Italy as a great power during the world wars. Italy embarked on some colonialism late in the game, and indeed took over some bits of Africa, including Libya, Somalia and Eritrea (which are, tragicomically, perhaps the most ruined and degraded states in Africa today). It participated in World War I, and by some measures caused the dissolution of Austria-Hungary after the battle of Vittorio Veneto.

* **WWE United Kingdom Championship, 2 out of 3 Falls Match.**
Pete Dunne vs. Tyler Bate.  Truthfully, there isn't a match on the card that I could come up with that would be as good as this would be, especially considering the two show-stealing matches they've had before this.  This would be the rubber match, the blowoff match and it would be fantastic.

* **NXT Women's Championship** - Asuka (c) vs. Paige vs Nikki Cross.  I don't think Paige can win here, so that makes Vince happy... but it could be a real treat to see a good match between these three.  Asuka pins Paige, I imagine.

* **Singles Match** Finn Balor vs Aleister Black - Titty sprinkles, please.

* **Singles Match** Drew McIntyre vs Trent Seven - I'm not sure that Drew would tower over the guy, but I think these two would be good in a match together.

* **WWE Raw Tag Team Championships** - Cesaro and Sheamus vs Killian Dain and Eric Young.  Okay, I get it.  Eric Young isn't from Europe.  Forgive me... he and Asuka will be the only ones.  

* **WWE Cruiserweight Championship** - Neville (c) vs. Mark Andrews.  How this guy wasn't immediately put onto 205 Live is beyond me.  It's a natural fit there.  And if you don't think these two could steal the whole damn show, you're out of your mind.

* **6 Pack Challenge Match** - Jack Gallagher vs Noam Dar vs. Wolfgang vs. Joseph Conners vs. Danny Burch vs. Jordan Devlin.  So, the winner of this would get a future shot and be named the #1 contender for the UK Championship.  Put on a great match here and it's a nice cross-brand feel between 205 Live, NXT and the UK guys.

Either the EU is a single superstate, or it's a group of independent countries. It can't be both. 

If it isn't a superstate, and it's basically like NAFTA, then there are no grounds to lump it together as one, and leaving it should be pretty straightforward. After all, there's not much evidence that trade blocs revolutionise the prosperity of the countries within them. Serious economists no longer view free trade as some kind of economic panacea. 

If the EU is a superstate, on the other hand, then it will be much harder for Britain to leave, as a breakaway province. But if that's the situation, then there needs to be an inquiry into how a decision to join what was billed in 1975 as a ""common market"" somehow managed to vassalise the UK as a province of a continental empire without the express consent of its inhabitants. 

In other words - if Britain is still a sovereign country, then leaving the EU should be no big deal. If Britain isn't a sovereign country and is actually ""declaring independence"", then its voters have been lied to on an epic scale by successive generations of officials and politicians, who could in fact be prosecuted for this.

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

I live in the american mid west and i only see people that don't need to be having kids, having kids. By that i mean, mom and dad both have minimal education, they are both morbidly obese, wearing glasses and the kids are already overweight and seem.... off?

Every once in a while (this past Sunday, actually) when i come across a good looking family that has also reproduced. She had blonde hair and the husband had light brown hair, but they had this row of 4 kids with bright, platinum blonde hair and blue eyes. All of them were healthy weight, very bright, and well behaved. Even the mother, for having 4 kids in quick succession (the all looked to be about a year apart) looked very attractive. 

It made me feel good to see that, instead of seeing some pretty white girl with a half black mongrel on her hip. Which, honestly, is far too common now. However, it also reaffirmed by belief that i shouldn't have children. 

It was actually the major break between my ex-wife and I. She is of eastern european decent (tall, brown hair, blue eyes, beautiful) and i told her that i didn't feel right passing on my genes. She was okay with that at first, but as her biological clock started to tick and all her friends started having kids, she finally decided she couldn't live a life like that and decided to leave.

Primeiro dizes que a Carteira Profissional de Jornalista ""é apenas relevante para o estabelecimento de contratos de trabalho"" e agora dizes é só para ""vender trabalhos"" mas não para desenvolver a actividade... Daqui a pouco vamos descobrir que os jornalistas só o são se forem voluntários que nem trabalham com contrato nem vendem trabalhos em *freelance*.

A Carteira Profissional de Jornalista é um documento exigido aos portugueses para exercer a função de jornalista em Portugal. Como é que alguém que está sujeito a tal regra no seu próprio país me vem dizer que não sabia que não podia exercer o jornalismo num país estrangeiro com visto de turismo? Só acredita nessa quem quer - e mesmo que se acredite, é um atestado de incompetência ao dito ""jornalista"" que falhou logo no primeiro trabalho de recolha de informação relacionado com o assunto.

E sim, impedir a entrada dos jornalistas do Expresso só seria censura se fosse politica da Venezuela impedir a entrada a todos os jornalistas estrangeiros (ou quase todos, vá, fazendo o desconto do *Avante!*). Mas não é, como se pode comprovar por praticamente todos os canais de comunicação de massas a que temos acesso em Portugal, da RTP à CNN passando pela Euronews. Portanto explica-me lá qual é que é ""o objectivo"" deste acto de censura. Porque o único objectivo que eu vejo é um golpe publicitário d'O Expresso, com impacto nulo sobre as noticias que saem da Venezuela.

Nota: estou a falar deste caso concreto. Internamente, os jornalistas Venezuelanos parecem estar sob considerável pressão, e não tenho razões para duvidar do relatório dos JSF que declaram a Venezuela um país em ""Difficult Situation"" no [2017 World Press Freedom Index](https://rsf.org/en/ranking).

&gt; * The mass trial, which kicked off at a purpose-built courtroom outside Ankara on August 1, is the largest yet relating to last year's failed putsch against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

&gt; * The case centers around the Akinci air base, northwest of the capital, which the government says the coup plotters used as their headquarters.

&gt; * The trial is one of dozens that are under way in Turkey in relation to the failed putsch that resulted in about 250 deaths in July 2016.

cmmgreene,thunderbolts,,"&gt;I totally see what you're saying (hopefully) but, if mutants are supposed to be an allegory for racial minorities and a movie studio makes a mutant character a minority then what sort of meaning is lost?

I will try explain, one of the many debates in within my own culture (black, African American, Afro Caribbean etc) Is passing for white, or intergration into white/European culture. In the black community, some born of mixed parents may choose to identify as white, of course this helps if they don't look entirely black. This is called passing for white. I can totally see the allegory in the comics, the more pacifist branch like X-men want integration, which is nice when your mutation leaves you looking mostly human. However if your a Morlock, you may not be able to ""pass"". Morlocks may favor the militant wing of mutant rights. If the allegory holds true then the Brotherhood of Mutants would favor the Back to Africa, Black is Beautiful movement. 

Traditional Domino cannot easily hide her mutation, so you have a great way to shape her character. Was she tormented in her youth, and she started off in the militant wing. Or did she start of with pacifist ideals and her mutation happened, then she shifts into the militant wing. 

In movies where you have to use short hand to tell stories, a lot can be lost or gained by a character's appearance.  In the comics there's a lot of love lost between some of the Morlocks and X men, its easy to claim peaceful relations with humanity when most of the X men look like super models.",True,False,,0,1501587635,,False,0,dl0afu9,False,t3_6qpakd,t1_dl021nw,1503666069,3,False,Marvel,t5_2r40o,

Besides being wrong, ""It was bad before too!"" is not an effective argument against criticism of autocratic tendencies. Turkey was never a model democracy when compared to western states, true,  but in the Muslim world it used to be the poster child of democracy. Indeed there was clear seperation between the parliament, judiciary and the executive. The constitutional changes are eroding those seperations. If you deny that, you're a liar. Tayyip can now pass laws by himself, making the parliament a laughing stock. Laws can still be challenged by the highest court but guess who appoints half the judges?

We finally get a wot type of game that is in some ways similar to wot, in other ways totally different and actually improves on the genre. Wot+rpg+new game elements, damn, the hpye was real.

And then reality kind of hit us hard. Obsidian is constantly arguing with mail.ru, and just like bioware with EA, mail.ru won, and the developers and their vision, were forced out, and pretty much ruined the game experience for most of us.

No actual PVE, but some basic maps with bot scripts that are at times laughably stupid, no proper story driven campaign, instead we get some fanfic written by SS, and that is pretty much it. Base gets castrated, uniqueness of each tank class gets trashed, no more ecu boost, no more snipe skill.

Game becomes more and more similar to wot, and instead of innovation, we get bland copy/paste mechanics from wot, from a company that already ordered a copy/paste wot game(via some chinese developers) that they were actually sued for. The game is called ground war tanks.

So yeah, that is pretty much it. Now people like me, who invested time and money in this game, are just sad in a way to see a game that had huge potential, go down the drain. I've been here since the alpha, I was there when we tested the tanks in the alpha, when we gave feedback on how to improve this game, we wanted to help with the vision of making this something that wot could not even dream of becoming.

I don't think there is very much difference between different tribal peoples and ancestral groups when it comes to general terms. Faith, spirituality, government, family roles, and so on. Yes there are certainly different mannerisms, but I have found most people want whats best for their children.

There are always those who are greedy and they usually disrupt territorial holds of ethnic cultures. With most people who just seek existence in the world, it is the greedy or brash members who don't look beyond themselves that are often causing trouble that lead to disputes. But people stand with family and clan over strangers, and for trust and dependency there is reasoning that I agree with.

In all my life, in a family of 7, 5 acres has been enough to produce food, have shelter and let the dominant course of nature take place. I don't think people generally need a lot land or resources unless historically you are subsistent off of herds and livestock. They graze and need land, dispute their is who has claim of the animal or who wants the land for their animals. Jewelry that is a little more complex and I would need to time to build a narrative for that.

Instead of nepotism, recently, I have been inclined to think the man/woman of merit and capability should be the one to fulfill roles of communities. Those who aspire to master those roles should loyally watch learn and listen, while adding personal insight and perspective. It is the exchange of knowledge and the willingness to better people that truly makes culture.

Obviously most people have some world code, and that is broadly exchanged. Atheism, a gnosticism, and theism are some commonly debated, but it is information and many minds and generations that have built the foundation for culture and personal pursuits. The tribal mentality comes from the families, and kinsmen who have frown together. Hence tribal feuds with others.

Now the Native Americans who have been to Europe and have written and documented things that is a question that will have to be put on hold. I am sorry that I can't continue the conversation more fully. But you pose a great search that would contribute to better dialogue between Native and non-Natives in America and larger global discussions of indigenous discourse.

Is there a particular timeline that you want of Native personal documentation? Do you want 17th century, 18th century, 19th and so on...

You will probably have to wait a year or so for a quality answer there. If I get accepted into the Indigenous Law program I am looking at there will be a lot of law built from the early 17th century to the present over the course of the program. As I would learn I would channel the conversation and sources to the thread and you.

For the Dark Ages, that is a thought experiment worth drawing up for discussion. I could give a good alternative history question with analysis in a week or so if you wait.

It seems the questions worth discussing that build society take years and years.

&gt;I find it hard to think you really believe that. We've had decades of further integration with a few opt-outs here and there. I don't see how the EU was going to radically change its path over the past four decades all of a sudden. We know this, come on. This is the basic easy parts of the debate. The EU wants to bring the member states closer together and they do this by treaty changes every few years. This is so basic I'm amazed i'm having to explain this to you. Jeeze.

First of all for the child slave thing, until a certain amount of reports came out, Nestle either A) knew they were using child slaves and didn't care or B) didn't know they were using child slaves, meaning they didn't give enough of a shit to bother looking into this vital fact. It's not like they've really fixed their shit up either, they are still purchasing cocoa from these exploitative farms as of 2002 (I'd bet my bottom dollar they still are, but 2002 is when a popular documentary on the issue came out and it's fucking up my search results, and I'm not gonna bother looking for more recent sources). In the link I provided above, their exploitative practices aren't limited to child slavery.

http://corta-fitas.blogs.sapo.pt/sera-do-guarana-6391031

A coincidencia espacial  não é prova de causalidade, como o tamanho do sapato estar directamente relacionado com QI não é causalidade.

Mas saber que o mato gosta muito do mesmo que o eucalipto: água e sol, é capaz de justificar as três coisas sobrepostas. Está tudo na mesma região porque o mato e eucalipto estão juntos porque mamam água e sol e os fogos adoram mato e logo aparecem onde há eucalipto que gosta de sol e água como o mato....

É que basta ver que no resto da Europa os pontos quentes de fogos coincidem com os pontos quentes de mato, onde NÃO há eucalipto. Uma teoria que explica tudo, ao contrário de uma que explica metade..... Eu sei qual prefiro.

Dizer que espacialmente os fogos e o eucalipto coincidem é muito diferente que quase todos deflagra em eucalipto. Porque a maioria deflagra à beira das casas e estradas, que podem não ter, e não tem, eucalipto em metade dos casos.

Die supranationalen Institutionen beruhen doch erst recht auf dem Konzept von Nationalstaaten, oder nicht? Wir haben in der EU doch schon genügend Schwierigkeiten, 27+1 Haltungen unter einen Hut zu bekommen. Wie wollen wir das denn mit vielleicht Hunderten von Regionen machen? Gleiches gilt für die UN. Gerade G7/G8/G20 sind auch Versammlungen von Staaten, eben nicht von Regionen. Wie wollen die zu Potte kommen wenn der Staat eben nicht mehr von Merkel, Macron usw. repräsentiert werden kann, weil es diese Rollen nicht mehr gibt? Dann gibt es eben keine ""deutsche"" Haltung mehr, sondern vielleicht gleich 16 Stück, fall wir dann auf Länderebene weitermachen.

Ich stimme dir völlig zu dass lokale Problemlösungen häufig besser sind als die, die weit weg am grünen Tisch erdacht wurden. Das betrifft aber nur Probleme, die lokal gelöst werden können. Wenn es komplexere Dinge sind, die viele Parteien betreffen, wird das schon nicht mehr gehen. Es gibt dann ja keine Telefonnummer mehr, bei der du einen nationalen Minister oder eine Staatssekretärin erreichst. Alles muss mit super viel klein-klein mit allen ausgehandelt werden. Die notwendige Kommunikation wird explodieren. Im Übrigen ist die EU weltweit einzigartig. Vieles von dem was du vorschlägst wird sich woanders wohl kaum umsetzen lassen.

Und was ich schon bedenklich finde: In deiner Skizze kommen keine Menschen vor. Identität, Heimat, Geschichte: Das alles sind Dinge, die für sehr sehr viele Menschen äußerst wichtig sind. Man kann der Ansicht sein dass es so nicht sein sollte, das ändert aber nichts daran, wie es ist. 

Natürlich sind Nationalstaaten kein Wundermittel, es gibt leider wenig Wundermittel auf der Welt.

There are 3 ways we can deal with this invasion:
1) Block and deport, which is partially what Trump ran on.
2) Retreat, eventually out of the country, and let them just trash everything we built. If we do this, we would have to go begging to Russia or Eastern Europeans to let us in, which is pathetic and may not happen.
3) Allow it to continue until we have nothing to lose but our lives, which will have become thoroughly unbearable by that point and no great loss to lose.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

Try the Starter Edition ([US](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition) / [EU](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition)) to get a free taster of WoW, then:

_perpetual_student_,major,Chemistry,"Textbooks have risen in price faster than any other facets of college life.  There are ways to get around the worst of the costs most of the time.  

First, never, ever buy textbooks from the campus bookstore if you can help it.  No matter where you go, that's the most expensive option.  Aggregate websites like BigWords.com and AbeBooks.com tend to be your best option for purchasing or renting a textbook.

Second, always directly ask the professor if textbooks are required for their course.  Many will answer a polite email before the start of the semester.

Third, the international editions of most books are generally identical to the us editions.  The differences when they exist are lower quality paper and different end of chapter questions.  

Fourth, the vast majority of the classes you will take will have the textbooks and solutions manuals on reserve at the libraries.  Use this to your advantage.  You can get the international editions for reading and check your homework at the library to make sure you have the right questions.

Fifth, many textbooks are available as pdfs and can be found online through less than or in some cases completely legal means.  Many European universities post pdf copies of their textbooks.  I carry a thumb drive with copies of many of my textbooks and my coursework on it.  It's saved my grade more than once.

Finally, get to know your classmates.  A bit of networking goes a long way to help you figure out what you need to know.  Some classes don't use the textbooks much, they use the professor's lectures.  Some classes have everything posted online and you don't typically get a lot out of the lecture.  Some professors are really awesome and others kinda suck.  Some professors use basically the same exams over and over again.  Some always assign a group project.  The best way to find out which is which is to get to know the people around you.

And that is why Trump's comments questioning the relevance of NATO were troubling for many Eastern European leaders.

And we haven't faced this problem since the Cold War started(late 40s). We've faced this problem since the Soviets tested and fielded several ICBMs capable of hitting American cities(late 50s). The Soviet Union fielding ICBMs capable of holding American cities hostage led some in Europe to question the United States' commitment to check Soviet ambition in Europe. This was one of the reasons behind France's pursuit for its own nuclear weapons.

This is an issue now, because unlike the Soviet Union, North Korea is not a stable member of the international community, and has been engaged in aggressive rhetoric and action directed at South Korea. The United States essentially worked with the Soviet Union on weapons treaties and other issues of concern to global stability. MAD doesn't work in every situation, and the room for a miscalculation is much higher with North Korea than with the Soviet Union or Russia. Japan and South Korea will show increasing willingness to pursue their own weapons programme.

Lying_Dutchman,t6,,"&gt; It highlights how, both in media and in some social circles, the sexuality of non-white people is discussed in comparison to that of white people, rather than as its own thing.

Isn't this rather, well..obvious? If groups of white people (which a lot of US media consists of) want to describe another culture or group of people, they will have to do so from their own frame of reference.

If you explain Japanese religion to Europeans by saying that it's more concerned with spirits, rather than gods (or a God), you're describing Shinto in European terms, because that's your audience. It doesn't mean that you think Shinto is an inferior religion, or that European religions are the worldwide standard. (Well, Catholicism kind of is, but nvm).

It's only the 'standard' in the sense that it's what most of the audience, and most of the speakers are used to.

In addition to that, I'm not so sure about the part of the Three Bears Theory where white men's sexuality is 'just right'. There are stereotypes of black men revolving around them being 'too masculine', but that is generally about violence, not big dicks and sexual virility.

BroaxXx,,,"Acho irresponsável e falso insistir que as pessoas não têm responsabilidade pela sua auto-defesa. Se um peão atravessa a rua tem, nem que seja 0.0000000000001% da responsabilidade sobre o seu atropelamento pois é sua responsabilidade assegurar as suas condições segurança (olhar para os dois lados, neste caso) e uma falha a fazê-lo é, por definição, uma **irresponsabilidade**. Assim, **se vais a atravessar a rua a olhar para o telemóvel também tens culpa sobre o que ate aconteceu.** 

Posto isto a tua resposta não passa dum argumento de homem de palha para tentar desviar o foco da conversa do tópico em questão. Eu não percebo esta nova cultura de desresponsabilização total dos indivíduos. Mas ora aqui vamos:

# UM AGRESSOR É UMA BESTA, UM MONSTRO, E UM CRIMINOSO. DEVE SER PRESO E CASTIGADO PELOS SEUS CRIMES! 

Posto isto não consigo em consciência dizer que a vítima está 100% livre de responsabilidade. Foi ela que escolheu o parceiro, foi ela que ignorou os sinais que o comportamento dele estava a começar a mudar, foi ela ela que decidiu ficar com ele depois de ter sido agredida pela primeira vez (normalmente estas agressões escalam e começam com uma chapada e acabam com um homicídio). Mesmo que a vítima só tenha 0.000000000000000000000000000000001% da responsabilidade é importante ter noção disso até para que futuras vítimas se lembrem que têm sempre opção de evitar este tipo de coisas. 


Posto isto faço a ressalva para as pessoas mais ""antigas"" pois antigamente as pressões culturais eram diferentes, o divórcio não era opção, etc. 


Mas sinceramente, não compreendo como é que uma jovem que se envolve com um gajo que é violento com os seus amigos, agressivo a lidar com pessoas na rua  e, de forma geral, uma besta fica admirada quando ele um dia direciona essa agressividade para ela. 


Mas devo repetir: 

# O AGRESSOR É UM MONSTRO QUE DEVE SER EXEMPLARMENTE PUNIDO E A VÍTIMA DEVE SER PROTEGIDA E ENCAMINHADA PARA QUEM A CONSIGA AJUDAR!! COMPREENDO QUE O TIPO DE VIOLÊNCIA EMOCIONAL E PSICOLÓGICA FREQUENTEMENTE ACOMPANHA A VIOLÊNCIA FÍSICA E QUE A VIOLÊNCIA DOMÉSTICA É UM POÇO DE ONDE É DIFÍCIL DE SAIR.

Posto isto, já testemunhei algumas relações abusivas na sua génese e, felizmente, em todas elas a vítima pôs-se no caralho assim que se apercebeu a merda que o agressor era. 


Desta mesma forma se eu for a pé pelo bairro da pasteleira com um telemóvel topo de gama na mão a meio da noite e passar por um grupo de ~~ciganos~~ gunas com ar ameaçador não posso dizer que não seja também responsável por ignorar os sinais de perigo e não ter garantido as minhas condições de segurança (no mínimo esconder o telemóvel e dar meia volta/atravessar a rua). Se eu fosse assaltado nestas condições a primeira coisa que a minha mãe diria, e bem, era ""porque é que foste burro, também!?"". Acho que este raciocínio é válido para *todos* os crimes independentemente do impacto físico e emocional dele na vítima. 

As pessoas são responsáveis por criar as suas condições de segurança. Os agressores são monstros que devem ser punidos mas ao absolvermos a vítima de toda a responsabilidade no que lhe aconteceu estamos a promover uma sociedade em que as pessoas não se defendem de ameaças e se expõem muito mais ao perigo do que deviam. Claro que, numa sociedade perfeita, eu não devia ter que me preocupar em ser assaltado porém enquanto essa utopia não chegar tenho que aceitar a realidade que o mundo é um local perigoso e que eu preciso de fazer o que está ao meu alcance (dentro do razoável, claro) para prevenir estas ameaças ao meu bem estar.

This standard is of course vague but the UK will definitely have such a regime on the day of leaving, nonetheless, it was not a big surprise when the EU decided to violate both letter and spirit of the new rules immediately by announcing the UK's regulation would not be considered ""equivalent"" to the EU's.

This is grossly misleading. MIFID II does not grant automatic passporting rights to third country equivalent firms - they still have to establish themselves and be regulated by the host state unlike EU firms which require neither. 

Secondly, the EU has obviously refused to say whether the UK will be deemed equivalent because we haven't left yet and we can't have a cooperation agreement in place until we do. We'll obviously get one, it's just not something that happens automatically.

In Russia, on the other hand, they are quite happy to ignore the period in which the USSR was happy to assist Germany, conquer its neighbours and twiddle its thumbs behind their non-aggression pact. Instead they would point to the West as the ""real"" buddies of Hitler, given their policy of appeasement and things like their [selling out Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement) despite the USSR being willing to uphold their alliance with Czechoslovakia if only the western powers would stand up to Germany as well.

When Langdon wakes up in an Italian hospital with amnesia, he teams up with Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones), a doctor he hopes will help him recover his memories. Together, they race across Europe and against the clock to stop a madman from unleashing a global virus that would wipe out half of the world's population.

Alesayr,au,Australia,"&gt;I'm not throwing all Muslims there. There are no problems with Shia Muslims here in Europe. They have integrated just fine.
With Sunni Islam there is another matter. Please understand that I don't blame people. The issue at hand is Sunni Islam and how it is theologically made. It's hard for a born Muslim even to apostatize because of fear to be pushed aside or even to be killed. And you know it very well.

Ah, I see, that clarifies things a lot. 

I wonder if your problem might not be quite so much with Sunni Islam itself, but with the Wahhabi/Salafi subsets. Those are both really extreme and can cause serious radicalisation. You're right, Wahhabi theology can be quite dangerous. If you squeeze your comments from Sunni Islam in general to just the extremist Wahhabi stuff peddled by the Sauds, I stand in complete agreement with you. 

&gt; And I'm sorry but I didn't hear that it is all love and peaceable in Aussi land. You had your share of Sunni Islamic terrorism. Tell me, without Sunni Islam would you have had any?


No, without Islamic immigration there wouldn't have been terrorist attacks. But literally 5 people have died in Australia from terrorists in the last couple of decades (not including the perpetrators). You're hundreds of times more likely to die from falling off your chair and cracking your head open. 

To look at the miniscule number of deaths terrorism causes and go ""no, because of this risk we will not be compassionate to these people who need our help"" is silly. Being afraid of terrorism is silly, it's like being afraid of getting attacked by bees. It's a really unlikely occurrence. 

&gt; And the thing is, you guys have an anti immigration policy that prevent anyone to sail as it pleases on Aussi shores. But in Europe we have not and we consider your anti immigration policy far right and discriminatory.

The Generalplan Ost (German pronunciation: [ɡenəˈʁaːlˌplaːn ˈɔst]; English: Master Plan for the East), abbreviated GPO, was the Nazi German government's plan for the genocide and ethnic cleansing on a vast scale, and colonization of Central and Eastern Europe by Germans. It was to be undertaken in territories occupied by Germany during World War II. The plan was partially realized during the war, resulting indirectly and directly in a very large number of deaths, but its full implementation was not considered practicable during the major military operations, and was prevented by Germany's defeat.

The plan entailed the enslavement, expulsion, and mass murder of most Slavic peoples in Europe along with planned destruction of their nations, whom the 'Aryan' Nazis viewed as racially inferior. The programme operational guidelines were based on the policy of Lebensraum designed by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in fulfilment of the Drang nach Osten (drive to the East) ideology of German expansionism.

The Enlightenment (also known as the Age of Enlightenment or the Age of Reason; in French: le Siècle des Lumières, lit. 'the Century of Lights'; and in German: Aufklärung, 'Enlightenment') was an intellectual and philosophical movement which dominated the world of ideas in Europe during the 18th century, The Century of Philosophy. The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on reason as the primary source of authority and legitimacy, and came to advance ideals like liberty, progress, tolerance, fraternity, constitutional government, and separation of church and state. In France, the central doctrines of les Lumières were individual liberty and religious tolerance in opposition to an absolute monarchy and the fixed dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church.

1) Casters employment/visas - All casters of official LCS events are official Riot employees. Period. They may work out of the US offices, or Europe, or elsewhere, but they are employees, not contractors. This enables Riot to have casters from their US office cast in Europe, and vice versa through visas for international transfer from another office. They do not have to apply for extremely complicated, unlikely, and expensive work visas, because they have offices in multiple locations and the paper trail to back it up. 

2) LCS Visa situation - When Riot set up the LCS in 2013 they went through a process with a law firm and the USCIS to classify the LCS as a ""Major League"" similar to the NBA, NHL, etc. This is a classification based off of total revenue and exposure of the league. 

By classifying the LCS as a Major League, players are nearly pre-approved for a proper P or O visa (I'm not sure which they're using currently), as long as the LCS notifies USCIS that this player is indeed coming here to play in the Major League. This visa is then tied to the player and the org they represent, **not** Riot as many people think.

&gt;""It would be very desirable for the U.S. government to sit down with us at the negotiating table and to work through an acceptable solution for all parties.""

Shameless_Bullshiter,,I hated Theresa May before it was cool! Stop Brexit. -8.2: -7.5,"A century after Passchendaele, the death site of hundreds of thousands of allied and German soldiers, the causes of the great war remain contested. Among the scholarly guesses is that Europe was mesmerised by its own long peace. The concert of empires that had averted general continental violence also inured populations to the reality of it. They went to war in a jingoist stupor because they lacked the recent experience to know better.

Today, nothing on the turbulent horizon of the western world equals that war. It is turbulent all the same. There is a similar feeling of a liberal order besieged and, dare we say, a similar sense of innocents volunteering for trouble without really knowing it.

There is an accepted explanation for Brexit, Donald Trump’s US presidency, Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party and other unconventional movements of the day. Voters are upset about stagnant wages and the crash. Elites have disgraced themselves with material excess and technocratic fumbles. People are interested in drastic change because things have been so bad.

This remains the best guess. But the opposite view is worth entertaining. What if the Petri dish of radicalism is not mass suffering but prolonged order? What if electorates flirt with high-risk change out of complacency born of (relative) good times?

The median Briton, who is 40, has no recollection of national crisis: no devaluation, no three-day week, no conscript war, none of the floor-to-ceiling greyness of the postwar years, when austerity entailed the rationing of basics and not just tight public-sector pay settlements, none of the little humiliations that came with being poorer than other European countries and shut out from their embryonic project of union. Even the background spectre of a world-ending nuclear exchange had more or less passed by the time this notional citizen became a teenager. The worst ordeals were an invasion of Iraq conducted by an all-volunteer army and a crash in which unemployment peaked at 8 per cent.

To remain vigilant after such a benign experience of history is too much to ask. The temptation is to treat order and gradual progress as things ordained by nature — to believe that electoral choices cannot threaten these cosmic entitlements. Politics becomes a kind of elevated sport: a means of venting and expressing oneself at low risk. Nor is it a clinching counter-argument that older voters turned out for Brexit. Even they have spent the past few decades in a secure, well-governed country that steered resources to their own generation. Their propensity to take it all for granted will have grown with each of those passing years.

 
If this is a harsh reading of the electorate, it may at least serve as a verdict on the political class. Consider the breeziness of Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and David Davis, the Brexit secretary, or the ministerial bickering of recent weeks, or the personality cult that forms around any MP who seems a character. There is a frivolity to politics that is too easy to blame on the rich-kid takeover of public life. These are not all scions of the gentry re-living their election to Pop at Eton. The telling variable is generation, not class. Harold Macmillan had social advantages to embarrass any of them, but the prime minister from 1957 to 1963 also sustained wounds in the great war and feigned death to escape enemy soldiers. After that, a certain seriousness tends to come over a man.

 
There is nothing like the fresh memory of loss to discipline a person — or a nation. It explains why the populist surge that seemed pan-western looks decidedly Anglo-American. Continental Europe has a sharper sense of the tragic and therefore of the stakes. Germany was split until 1990. Spain did not join the EU until 1986. France has had enough brushes with zealots of left and right to keep it honest.

None of this is argued with certainty. But if the received view is right, and people have turned to the fringes as a reaction to hardship, it follows that the wartime generation (who tasted the ultimate hardship) and their children (who lived in the sickly Britain of the 1970s) should have done the same. Instead, they voted for the mass moderation of Butskellism and Blatcherism, when governments were interchangeable and consensus was stifling. They avoided risk for the same reason no one touches a hot pan twice.



The fainter our memory of trauma, the greater our appetite for risk. If the analysis is bleak, then its implication is bleaker. Countries have to try bad ideas once in a while to remember they are bad.

&gt; With each day that passes and the ramifications of Brexit  become evermore entwined.  leaving aside the damage that is being done to the UK’s economic and political reputation, we now see the stirrings, deliberate and calculated, of a pot of debate on a putative Irexit, an Irish exit from the European union. Like it or not this debate will continue, and to ignore it is neither politic nor possible. That it is ridiculous and risible is obvious to even a casual analysis, but we have seen with Trump and Brexit that mere foolishness does not deter a polity from a course of action.

&gt; So lets look at the economics and politics of Irexit.

&gt; First, the politics. Irexit is a policy which is pushed, domestically, by few.  88% of people, in the last poll, were in favor of remaining in the EU.  We are even the most optimistic about the future of the EU, from the latest Eurobarometer. So, no, no Irexit swell of opinion there.

&gt; There is an Irexit group, but they are as credible as a ice fireguard, unable to even keep their website alive. Most all of these pushing Irexit are older white males. This is a reality. It is also a reality that given such two facts follow.

&gt; First, the deleterious effects of any Irexit would happen long after they are no longer liable to suffer from same. They are superannuated, in every sense of the word.  Second, ageing western white male baby boomers (such as , technically, myself) are perhaps the single most insulated group on the planet when it comes to economic and political dislocation. Little skin in the game renders it a parlour game, an intellectual exercise, a gadfly exercise in what-iffery.  The most recent contribution to the debate was from Ray Bassett, ex Irish Ambassador to Canada (with whom we have via the EU a common market, and with whom we would not have were we to exit) who wrote a position paper for the UK ginger group Policy Exchange.

&gt; More interestingly the UK proponents of Irexit make for a startling insight into the psych of the Brexit pushers. Some are out and out revanchists, such as Nigel Lawson, ex chancellor of the Exchequer, who have suggested that Ireland should, post Brexit, rejoin the UK. Others such as Melanie Phillips, a Times columnist , have previously doubted the legitimacy of the Irish state and now suggests that Ireland should leave the EU to form a free tradearea with the UK. Others, such as the DUP’s Ian Paisley Jr seem to think that because Brexit will be so wonderful we should join. Ian also famously urged his DUP supporters to take out an Irish passport, presumably because Brexit will be so wonderful.  Back to Policy Exchange, which published Ray Bassett’s opinion. Policy Exchange is rated as the lowest of all UK think tanks for transparency. It is absolutely opaque as to who funds it. When someone is suggesting a fundamental change in my national political system, I like to know who the are.  All this is reminiscent of the angst in the UK about migration, which exploded post EU enlargement despite the majority of migration coming from ex UK colonies. The UK right seems to be able to draw fine distinctions between “our” migrants (ex colonies) and others,  Poles and Romanians and whatnot from far off countries of whom they know little. Commonwealth migrants good, non commonwealth bad. The data from the UK Office of National Statistics shows clearly that in every single years since 1991 inward migration from non-EU, overwhelmingly from UK ex colonies, exceeded comfortably that of EU. But the reality is that the toxic sludge of debate has focused on the EU migrants. A curious xenophobia.

&gt; Then we have the economics of Irexit. Since 1992 especially, with the single market which Irexit would sever us from, we have seen a remarkable shift from dependence on the UK to a much more global focus. This is evident in both imports and exports, in both goods and services. Leaving aside concerns, real and substantial, as to the nature of some of the flows around services, the trend is undeniable and longterm – we have moved from an economic appendage of the UK to a small but integrated cog in the global economic system.  Does anyone think that tax alone would keep the large MNC sector located here? The reality is that large swathes of our exports in services and in goods are dominated by MNC’s. These MNC’s use the combination of factors, including the membership of the Single Market, to justify Ireland as a base. Leaving the single market would sever this.

&gt; An exception is the agribusiness market which is both domestic owned and generally small scale as well as facing disproportional exposure to the UK. The reality is that a UK outside the customs union and single market will be harder to crack. But we export more in education services than in beverages ; we  exportthree times or more manufactured goods than food; we export six times more in chemicals and related; value added by industry or by distribution and transport is more than 10 times that of agriculture.  Seeking Irexit on the basis that it would be good for agribusiness is seeking to amputate a hand for a broken finger. the department of finance have done excellent work on sectoral exposure to Brexit. It makes for sobering reading for some

&gt; The EU have made it clear, as they have to, that there will be no frictionless borders between the union and the UK. Brexit will be dislocative.  As smaller irish companies start to go to the wall post Brexit expect the calls for “something to be done” to stat to include Irexit. But this way madness lies.

Negative emotionality and discipline as long-term predictors of behavioral outcomes in African American and European American children.

Abstract:

&gt; The present study examined the early parenting and temperament determinants of children’s antisocial and positive behaviors in a low-income, diverse ethno-racial sample. Participants were from the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project, which included 960 European American (initial M age = 15.00 months; 51.2% female) and 880 African American mothers and their children (initial M age = 15.10 months; 49.2% female) followed from 15 months of age to 5th grade. For European American children, findings showed direct and indirect effects (via self-regulation) of early negative emotionality on later behaviors. For African American children, discipline practices in infancy had direct long-term implications for behaviors in 5th grade. Discussion highlights the interplay of parenting, temperament, and culture from infancy to late childhood.

I'm 19 and my sister got married at 19 to a man she only knew for six months and they are going on 12 years with lovely kiddos. 

This doesn't mean I want to get married this year or soon, though. My dreams involve finishing school and getting a job that challenges me in a math/business field, but who knows. I'm open to all avenues and am excited to graduate and hopefully maintain my 4.0 as long as possible. These are my short term dreams. 

Long term, I want to help my boyfriend achieve his goals of making music and help him make his first million. I know he can do it, as long as he gets himself on social media. I also want to make my own bank (hopefully, with a math for business major and economics and sociology minor plans) so we can get a nice house with an AMAZING bathroom with large floor tiles. My bathroom at home right now has tiny lil tiles that the 70s seemed to be obsessed with and they're so gross cuz the grout to tile ratio is far too big (small? there's too much grout, bottom line). 

I dream of having a typical suburban life with a bit of pizzazz. Maybe we'll be moderately famous because of my boyfriend, but if not, I plan to take my whole family traveling as our kiddos grow and our lives progress. I grew up as a military brat and have lived in Europe for half of my life. I wanna share that with my kiddos, even if I'm not active. 

I want an adventurous but simple life. I like a bit of glamour and flash, but my goals generally align with the American Dream. Hopefully I can achieve it.

I'm sure many people know this to be true from the type of (thousands) comments on Leave .eu, Daily Mail, Vote leave pages, compared to Scientists for EU or similar. But it is very un-british to accept it and people get offended by it if you mention it.

I think we're both (obviously) biased towards our clubs and there's not much we will agree on here. 

You see losing out to Madrid last year as a fluke and i see it as a sign of regression. At the same time you see us losing out to Monaco as a sign of regression when I consider it as a fluke. 

Sure Ligue 1 isn't attractive today, but it will be once Neymar is here. TV rights will go up (rumors has it the TV rights war has already started in Brazil, understandibly so) and smaller clubs will get more competitive. Besides PSG and Monaco (CL semi-finalist last season mind you) you have teams like Nice, Lyon, Lille with Bielsa, and even Marseille who are getting more and more competitive thanks to new stadiums (thanks to the euro), new owners or new coaches (Bielsa's Lille is going to be a fun team to watch out for this season) 

With that said, I still think Ligue 1 is clearly the least attractive of the top 5 european leagues, mostly because the people in France aren't as much into soccer as the other 4 but i'm willing to bet things will change when (if) Neymar comes. 

&gt;And I'm willing to go off on a limb here and assume that it's actually Neymar Sr. putting pressure on his son

Neymar Sr. helped his son become one of the best football players in the world, the soon to be best paid athlete in the world, and a huge international superstar. Do you really think Neymar cares more about your club than the man who made him the God he is today ? I think that's wishful thinking and that him and his father know exactly what they're doing and frankly it seems to be working. 

Neymar hasn't signed yet and as long as he is a Barcelona player he isn't gonna come out and say anything. Instead he will remain the professional you've known him to be, he will show up, do his job, and go home. Nothing is stopping him from saying he wishes to stay in Barcelona though if that was his intention. 

I'll just leave it at that, my initial comment was just to point out how bias affect how we perceive explanations.

The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) is a regional trade organisation and free trade area consisting of four European states: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. The organisation operates in parallel with the European Union (EU), and all four member states participate in the European single market.

On 3 May 1960, the EFTA was established to serve as an alternative trade bloc for those European states that were unable or unwilling to join the then European Economic Community (EEC) (which subsequently became the European Union). The Stockholm Convention, to establish the EFTA, was signed on 4 January 1960 in the Swedish capital by seven countries (known as the ""outer seven"").

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(Factortame_Ltd)_v_Secretary_of_State_for_Transport

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(Factortame_Ltd)_v_Secretary_of_State_for_Transport

&gt; In R v Secretary of State for Transport, ex p Factortame Ltd, the House of Lords ruled that courts in the United Kingdom had the power to ""disapply"" acts of parliament where they conflicted with EU law. Lord Bridge held that Parliament had voluntarily accepted this limitation of its sovereignty, being fully aware that, even if the limitation of sovereignty was not inherent in the Treaty of Rome, it had been well established by jurisprudence before Parliament passed the European Communities Act 1972.[14]

&gt; If the supremacy within the European Community of Community Law over the national law of member states was not always inherent in the EEC Treaty it was certainly well established in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice long before the United Kingdom joined the Community. Thus, whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary. Under the terms of the 1972 Act it has always been clear that it was the duty of a United Kingdom court, when delivering final judgment, to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law.

But the real impact of EU law is laws that are never presented to parliament in the first place.

For example EU rules on state aid,  freedom of movement,   equal treatment of EU nationals, social chapter , workers' rights,  mean that whole sections of our politics are no longer under control of parliament.

President Clinton came along, the next president, and in a couple of years they expanded NATO even further. In fact, one might ask why NATO even continued to exist. The official justification for NATO was that its purpose was to defend Western Europe from Russian hordes who might attack Western Europe...Well, 1990-1991 — no Russian hordes. Natural conclusion — ok, let’s disband NATO. The opposite happens – NATO expanded...The official mission of NATO became to control the international, the global energy system, pipelines.

The big thing about the germanic norse cultures is they were a whole bunch of tribes that shared a few gods. Women had a huge amount of power and could fight. The vast majority of them were farmers, merchants, tradesmen, etc, not the fictitious ""macho-warrior"" stereotype. And Vikings were literally just pirates (that's literally what the word means), and many of the populations in these loosely related cultures didn't really like them.

JD74,,,"&gt; Sorry, I wasn't clear. I meant why can't every European business apply to take over the top of search result pages for their preferred class of queries. Why can't every firm that did digital mapping make the same argument, or why can't Amazon claim that it should be their book results that are blended into search results instead of Google's (in Europe)?

My knowledge of technology is nowhere near the level of yours. However, the Commission's argument is that Google manipulated their algorithms to give Google Shopping an advantage. The solution to this is that everyone gets the same treatment under the search algorithms.

&gt; I think I'm starting to see the root cause of the mis-understanding here.
You can't just integrate competitors into Google the same way Google Shopping or Maps is integrated.
The reason is a litany of technical and practical problems. When you search on Google you're actually searching multiple search engines at once, with the results being blended via rather complex approaches and rendering being handled by specially written code that runs in the search servers themselves. There's no way for third parties to ""plug in"" to this because they're deeply integrated together and have very tight performance, security and scalability requirements.
To take Maps as an example rather than Shopping, if some tiny European startup that happened to make maps convinced the EU Commission that it should have been EuroMaps in Google results instead of Google Maps, and the Commission ruled that EuroMaps should appear instead by default, both sides would face massive technical problems ... basically EuroMaps would have to be for all practical purposes acquired by Google to make that work, and it'd immediately become dependent on that relationship for its success and survival ... making it not even clear that it'd be two separate companies anymore, defeating the point of an anti-trust action to begin with!
For example, one problem (I am a software engineer and used to work on search engines) is that to figure out if something is a map or shopping query, you have to feed every query typed in to that specialised search engine so it can decide whether e.g. ""bon jovi"" is a place or an item you can buy. That means EuroMaps or EuroShopping or whatever would get to see the entire European Google query stream, including very private queries e.g. medical queries that are not relevant for it at all. This would require vast capacity, server farms, privacy and security teams which startups would be unable to afford. Moreover, to avoid critical latency hits that'd slow down search for everyone, those servers would basically have to be colocated inside Google datacenters, and being inside Google datacenters requires running on Google designed hardware and software because the buildings, cluster control systems and everything else are all integrated together as well e.g. thermal management requires the machines to run a custom OS.
When the EU blunders around dropping fines and ordering companies to do things a different way, it's doing so from the perspective of a bunch of non-technical bureaucrats who know nothing about the industries they are trying to control. They have no understanding of why things work the way they do, they can't identify any actual victims, and they are frankly not even interested in solutions beyond topping up their budget without having to ask the Germans to do it.
Google has actually argued this point of view to the Commission (that search is one product), but the EU doesn't care. And why should it? The Commission directly profits from fining Google and there are no checks or balances. Even if Google appeals it still has to pay up right away, the appeal can take years, and in that time the EU can have already spent the money or invested it to earn interest and spent that. All the incentives are wrong.

Perhaps I wasn't clear with what I meant by the algorithms reflecting another product being better - I don't mean that any service should be the one that appears 'by default'. I would assume that Google's algorithms take traffic into account when organising the order of search results, so that if a link gets loads of clicks, it goes higher up the list. This is what I mean when I say the algorithms should reflect reality.

You probably have a point on the integration stuff. It seems, however (I can't seem to find the Decision itself, only a [memo](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-17-1785_en.htm)), that the Commission are basically telling them not to 'integrate' shopping comparison results at all, but only have them appear as normal search results. Here there is an additional question of whether or not the benefits of a slightly quicker service outweigh the damage caused to competitors and (potentially, though this isn't proven as far as I can tell) consumers, in the form of higher prices or a worse service.

&gt; I think there'd be a much stronger argument for that if it was clear that Google was actually causing harm. But the reason they don't have many competitors is not because of anti-competitive behaviours. It's because search engines are really hard to build, and in particular, niche search engines like maps, books, video or shopping results aren't actually good businesses. Google's money comes from commercial queries on regular web search. For various reasons it's hard to squeeze money out of the other types of search - Google does it mostly to reinforce their product as a one-stop-shop for everything rather than because integrating news or books is directly profitable (it's not). You can think of them as loss leaders.
But again, the EU doesn't understand any of that. They just want money. This is why regulation is nearly always a bad idea outside of a few very clear cases where economic theory and practical experience suggests no other way is truly possible (usually related to cost externalisation e.g. air or water pollution).

I'm not talking about this in a purely economic sense. Somewhat off topic, but I have severe reservations about a single entity controlling 90% of searches, as it in many ways converts them into a gateway of knowledge.

What happens if, for example, Google decides it wants to actively and fervently support the Tories? What if the first three pages of results for 'jeremy corbyn' are basically made up of IRA links, criticism of his manifesto, etc, with nothing to really balance it? Of course, if the reason for that were that the press are generally against him, you could hardly blame Google for putting huge newspapers above some guy's blog, but what if it were Google itself that were manipulating things for their own agenda? This is why I really think we should be keeping a very firm eye on them.

Also, I don't think how badly Le Pen was damaged by her televised debate with Macron is really appreciated in the UK. She not only performed poorly over the ~3 hours but was widely ridiculed for some of her arguments and presentation not just by opponents but even her own father.

&gt; Tasseomancy is a Canadian indie folk duo founded in Halifax, Nova Scotia and centered around twin sisters Sari and Romy Lightman, the project started life under the moniker Ghost Bees. Born and raised in Toronto, the Lightman twins moved to Halifax to attend university and began performing there.
The duo released their debut EP ""Tasseomancy"" on April 8, 2008, via Youth Club Records. Its cover is a photograph of the sisters' great-great grandmother Clara Chernos, a Russian Jewish tea-leaf reader who moved to Canada in the 19th century during the Russian pogroms. The pair toured extensively in support of the record, including shows in the UK and Europe.

&gt; As the Ghost Bees project developed, new sounds and influences not heard on the original EP began to be incorporated; prompting a name change to Tasseomancy in 2010. The twins recorded their debut full-length under the new name that year, produced by fellow Toronto based musicians Taylor Kirk and Simon Trottier of the band Timber Timbre. They released a 7"" single on friend Diamond Rings' boutique label Hype Lighter, and began performing in friend Katie Stelmanis' electronic outfit Austra as touring backing singers.

&gt; The debut album ""Ulalume"" was released on Out of this Spark/Turf Records in August 2011. Read more on Last.fm.

You're not the only one disappointed/upset that there was no ""hero's journey"" in trilogy-- but that's how real scientific progress is made (Einstein, Darwin, etc. all had their theories proven by OTHER people long after they're dead)... 

To my mind, viewpoint characters/ protagonists like Cheng Xin &amp; Luo Ji who strayed/stayed beyond their expertise are indicative of all the problems that hero worship (aka the fallacy of ""generalized"" Authority) can cause-- which is why I loved the fact that Liu didn't do any Joseph Campbell-like nonsense (""The Hero with A Thousand Faces"" refers to the creation of mythic figures by amalgamation of archetypes-- they don't realistically exist, except in a very mundane way)

The failings and, even worse, insignificance of humanity, is a quality you'll find in more Eastern European (Asian?) sci-fi-- e.g. Stanislaw Lem and the Strugatsky brothers typically sustain a narrative/ novel purely on the ""through-line"" of a theme/ thought experiment... to quote Liu, they just seem more aware of the ""gravity of reality"".


""I find it a bit frustrating the fact that the countdown played such a bug role on the character development at book one simply to be dropped as the rest of the story developed. It still bugs me that we either don't know if the countdown finished (as Wang Miao could very well just have given up his research) nor what happened to Wang Miao himself.""

Are you mis-remembering something? Cos there's no more point to the countdown or any other scare-tactics after it was discovered that the ETO/ sophons/ Trisolaris was behind the scientists' suicides.... of course, humanity had all of its nihilism to deal with-- now that they are stuck ""sharpening their spears"" instead of progressing on to quantum computing (&amp; possibly ""sentient"" AI). 

Anyway, revealing the inner workings of the ETO or even the Trisolarians  would probably be as pointless as revealing that the alien in the movie ""Alien"" (1979) was created by an android who was created by a man who was looking for the creator of humanity who....

Seriously? https://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1120/p09s02-coop.html This is not an idea I came up with its been studied for 300 years. Trade between nations makes war very difficult. 

&gt; It's as simple as that.

nuclear weapons, the diminished utility in owning any particular hunk of land, exponential increase in warfare, the rise of the partisan, mass communication, massive trade networks, take your pick really. France and UK were at each other's throats for hundreds of years mostly over things like fucking tea. You see that happening today in an era where you can grow tea anywhere? The last important region specific resource is petro and that is fading away as well. 

&gt;The US is fairly benevolent compared to some in that it chooses to maintain it's Empire via trade and alliances rather than by conquering territory (and of course it's important to remember the US does gain massively from this). This is primarily because it's a democracy so it's actions are accountable to it's people.

Ok? So we are not bad. That doesnt change the fact that we shouldnt have this level of power over humanity. Fucking hell how does anyone sleep at night knowing that Trump could end the human race at any moment!? This is a big big wake up call for us.

These food industries will go elsewhere, I am sure with Brexit it is more likely we will see these jobs go. Whilst I agree that there are a lot of foreign workers in jobs employment is at the highest level it has been so British people are still working being paid. I also cannot pull any statistics out the bag but I would imagine that there are a higher proportion of British people occupying professional roles thus the shift to lower paid jobs with more foreign workers. 

Ideology - Is this not natural with a more globalised world with trade deals. You can get from New York to London in less than a days work (7h.30m) which would have taken weeks previously. Whilst I can feel it is isolating it is the world we are going to continue living in whether we like or embrace it or not. 

Free Movement - We do this has been proven time and again statistically for a variety of sectors and jobs. If you wish to not accept this then this is down to your understanding and nothing I will say will help this. Yes English is the only language most Brits know however most countries like native speakers and can easily find a job in other European countries because everyone speaks English - difference is most Brits wouldn't go to German to work in a factory.

Meu problema aqui é que isso acontece o tempo todo, com relação a qualquer assunto, mas só quanto toca em pautas sociais surge o seu tipo de discurso. Você desmerece a pauta por ser de uma minoria e esquerdista. Isso é o tipo do discurso maniqueísta que tenho certeza que você critica na esquerda, e que a nova direita, e vc, fazem igualzinho. Qual o problema de ser uma minoria? Qual o problema de representá-la nas suas revistas? Qual o problema de ser de esquerda? Sempre um conceito impreciso e abrangente, identificado com o mal, pra se opor e justificar a si mesmo.

Não tem muito como argumentar contigo, porque você não dá muita margem pra isso. Faz afirmações categóricas, com base em pré-concepções, valores e preconceito. Não tem argumento racional que permita avançar a discussão. Porque é esquerda, porque é minoria, porque é forçada. Sim, é esquerda, é minoria, é forçada à sociedade. Você só se esquece de ver que são de esquerda, mas em relação a si mesmos, de minoria, que afeta apenas a eles e forçada, pq a sociedade resiste contra algo que não os afeta. Como não vão querer forçar a agenda na sociedade, sobre algo que não afeta a vida dos outros, se são a todo o momento impedidos?

And story-wise it makes sense. Tyrion was just saying how the Lannister armies (armored) will be better equipped than the unsullied (leather). Not being a weeaboo and just saying Japanese armor is superior because it's from Japan either. Japanese feudal armor continued to develop until the end of their feudal age around 1868? Their last major war (where there are likely military technological developments) was the Sengoku era which was all out chaos war from 1467 to 1603. Meanwhile, Europeans had advanced beyond armor development since gunpowder and guns made knights obsolete around the 15th century?

Most of the Game of Thrones armor/tech seems at least a few centuries behind that 1603-1868 period.

&gt; Mercedes-Benz banned a construction subcontractor from its plant in Vance, Alabama, after an CBS News investigation found that foreign workers had obtained visas on the basis of roles substantially different from those they ended up occupying.

&gt; Former workers confirmed to CBS News that the practice had been apparent since 2013, and a CBS News investigation has found that it continues to this day.

&gt; The CBS News team spent four months tracking more than 200 Eastern Europeans building U.S. auto factories, traveling to Croatia to meet one former worker who spent time working in construction at an automaker&amp;#039;s plant in the U.S. The full report aired on July 31 on both the CBS Television Network and CBSN during the premiere of &amp;quot;CBSN: On Assignment.""

DieRedditDie0oo0,,,"Well, I will put it this way; The refugees aren't cowards either. 

Why are 90% of ""refugees"" fighting aged men? Who is protecting their women and children? Why do they feel confident enough to leave their women and children alone and that they will be safe in Syria while they ""flee"" to Europe or America? The answer is that Muslim women and children don't need protection because no one is targeting them. They aren't in any danger. Assad's Alawite and Christian army doesn't pose a threat to women and children. They don't target them. The ""gas attacks"" were actually committed by Islamic Terrorists on their own people to get America to attack Assad. If refugees were legitimate, they would be 90% women and children, not the other way around and NO ONE would have a problem with helping them.

Only the Sunni Islamic Terrorists kill or enslave non-Muslim women and children and Sunni men are the vast majority (90%+) of the refugees coming to Europe. Only Islam allows for the killing of Kuffar (non-Muslim) women and children. It is actually ordered in the Quran by Allah. Islam advocates women and children being killed or  enslaved as a weapon of war. It's in the Quran and Muhammad did it in his own life as written in the Hadiths. Muhammad enslaved and killed entire villages of non-Muslims. 

Fortunately, the Jewish Syrians have all gotten out. The Christians and Yazidis are the only real refugees. Their women and children are in real danger, but the Muslims use the ignorance of the West to prevent their escape while pretending to be refugees themselves. There are UN run refugee camps that non-Muslims will be killed in if they flee there. Muslim refugees throw non-Muslim refugees off boats in the Mediterranean before landing in European claiming refugee status.  Non-Muslim are undergoing a genocide right now across the Middle East and Persia right now, the Western World is helping it happen, and main stream media refuses to report on it.

A study in Sweden proved that over 80% of ""child"" refugees were actually adult men. Why is that happening? It's because they aren't refugees. They are invaders. Muslims aren't in Europe to become European. Muslims are in Europe to make Europe Muslim. They are just using the system to destroy non-Muslims wherever they find them. They just don't have the power right now to attack the West except in small Terror Attacks. They will attack when they have a very good chance of victory. In the meantime, they burden the Kuffar and attack at the core of their fertility by attacking women and children in the West. By targeting women in non-Muslim nations they seek to ""win a womb for Allah"" and ""deny one to the Kuffar"". That is why it is forbidden for non-Muslim men to marry Muslim women. The children won't be Muslim. While Muslim men can take many non-Muslim slaves so all the children will be Muslim. Thus spreading Islam.

I know beyond a shadow of doubt that they are just parasites and invaders. They aren't worried that government forces in Syria will harm their women and children. They know they are safe. Many ISIS fighters put their families in UN refugee centers to keep them safe from reprisals while they go kill Christian and Yazidi women and children. Then they use the Wests generosity to flee to Europe or America when they lose on the battlefield. They can then use the money and resources of the West to resupply Islamic Terrorist back home.

This is what many Syrian Christians tell me. They tell me how the Terrorists use our system against them. That is why Christianity is dying in there and why Pagan Persians like the Yazidis are almost completely wiped from the earth. That land was Christian and Pagan for millennia. It's future is 100% Muslim.

&gt;Also: What's stopping you from joining Assad right now? Why not just stay in Syria after you won that glorious war you endorse?

I am not Syrian. It isn't my culture and I wouldn't be allowed there anyway.

Now having said all that, you will no doubt report me for hate speech because simply telling anyone about these crimes that are taking place, I put myself at risk of reprisal from Muslims and my own government.

bochief,f1-s8-f2-Koe,"Baht, ok... D'boy did well","With so many additions it could go either way, however Koeman succeeded with the annual overhaul that always happens at Southampton, which is why I think Moshiri wanted him so badly to begin with; he's a steady hand through transitional periods.

Liverpool and Spurs don't have enough depth to make a solid run in Europe in addition to making sure they compete in the cups and do well in the league - I'd say the same about Arsenal too but I doubt they will prioritise Europe above league positions this season. Also Jose only gave up on the league and aimed for cup success after the chance opened up, I think it was the semi final where he openly admitted that he no longer cared about league positioning. This season he will put extra focus on the Champions League, therefore less on the league. Though I think we will finish 7th or lower, it's definitely feasible that at least one of the 6 above us will drop this season. 

For us, Moshiri said league position is the gold standard and it is what he wants Koeman to focus on the most. With added depth I think this priority could wane should we do well in the cups, it's 17 games to play after Thursday to win the cup and though I don't think it will happen, we're capable of doing it. However Moshiri's words might be taken as gospel, in which case I could see us pushing top 5 if we completely disregard the cups. Personally this is what I want, I'd give my left bollock for top 3, and should we get full potential out of our current squad + Sig + a striker who can finish while some of the other teams drop off, then I honestly think we could get it. European football changes a season, I am expecting Chelsea/Liverpool/Man Utd to suffer due to new expectations - if we ignore our continental campaign then fuck it, we're dark horses to win the league. 

I think we will finish either 9th, 8th or 7th with a long run in at least one cup.

The primary merits of a particular strategy relate to its likelihood of success, and a war strategy can be measured by its ability to help achieve the end goal.   Assuming you consult with your military prior to starting a war, you may want to see if your goals are achievable to them.  Assuming you end up in a war, you should check regularly to see if your strategy is actually working.

The German military is a good case in point of the contrast between operational brilliance and strategic idiocy.  The sickle cut in France was a bold plan that succeeded beyond any reasonable expectation, but even conquering western Europe did not dramatically improve Germany's economic weaknesses.  Barbarossa was predicated on total victory in 6 to 8 weeks.  By November of 1941, any sane analyst would conclude that the chances of military victory of any kind were impossible.  Continuing to plan operations that were increasingly unlikely to alter this fact simply meant prolonging the conflict until Germany suffered total defeat.

I just followed the subreddit literally moments ago because I am an American citizen who, for about three years now, has been considering leaving the country for a more progressive, thoughtful nation, and Sweden has been near the top of my list for that entire duration.

Not to be too politcal, but the environment here in the United States hasn't exactly been amazing for the past year, either, and while I already considered myself a liberal, Bernie Sanders' campaign in 2016 cemented in my mind that democratic socialism is the way of the future, something I'm happy to see most of western and northern Europe already practicing.

In short, I came to this subreddit on a long-standing desire to find out what the people of Sweden are like by just casually getting to know them, if even in as simple a community as a subreddit. Already have much respect for the country and its citizens, and would be very happy to make new friends from there as well!

Jag har precis följt subreddit bokstavligen för tillfällen sedan eftersom jag är en amerikansk medborgare som i ungefär tre år nu har övervägt att lämna landet till en mer progressiv, tankeväckande nation och Sverige har varit nära toppen av min lista hela tiden .

Att inte vara för politisk, men miljön här i USA har inte heller varit fantastiskt under det gångna året, och medan jag redan ansåg mig en liberal, bekräftade Bernie Sanders kampanj år 2016 att den demokratiska socialismen är Framtidens sätt, något jag är glad att se mest av västra och norra Europa redan övar.

Kort sagt, jag kom till denna subreddit på en långvarig önskan om att få reda på vad sverige i Sverige är genom att bara lära känna dem, om än i så enkelt en gemenskap som en subreddit.

TyraCross,,,"Damn, now I feel like I want to share my thoughts on that: 

Captial ties aside, Germany and the EU are the perfect allies if you read some of the strategic classics such as the Art of War. They are far away, powerful, fairly friendly, and would help balance China's Rivals. 

Firstly, the end game of OBOR on paper is for Chinese goods to reach the EU, and vise-versa, thus making China less reliant on the US as the biggest trading partner.

Secondly, a powerful and strongly integrated EU, even without the UK, will immediately become the second most powerful entity on Earth in many aspects. An EU that isn't reliant on NATO and doesn't live under the US's shadow will help balance the world order. Germany can also provide some control over Russia. China will never completely trust Russia, the same can be said about Russia towards China. There is no way the Chinese long term strategy does not include some way to contain the geopolitical heartland. 

Take a look at the map, it goes EU - Russia - China - [Ocean] - US - {Ocean] - EU. An EU-China alliance will sandwich the Russia, and to a certain extent, the US. It is pretty ideal, strategically speaking. In fact, it is similar to the Chinese-Pakistani relationship against India, another natural rival of China.

Thirdly, as you state, there are a lot of investment ties. Germany as a country is a good investment. They also control most of the narrative of the EU. 

Lastly, Germany is a fairly pacificist country. And the EU, at the end of the day, is still a bloc. These two factors make them less threatening overall. 

I firmly believe that certain European leaders, such as Merkel, has been seeking for opportunities to further integrates the EU for a long time. With the UK leaving, and the sentiment against the current US administration rises, I find it likely that China will heavily support Germany and any initiative around integrating the EU.

And inhumane experiments conducted on Jews had benefits to modern medical knowledge. I am not arguing that giving stolen money to poor people doesn't help them.

&gt; Anyway, not sure your analogy makes sense. Why would I think the mugger is a hypocrite for eating the sandwich he bought? Unless you just made a mistake in referring to ""me"" as ""that man.""
Mistakes aside, I love how libertarians always talk about being held at gunpoint. It's so hilariously over dramatic

Learn to read.
And I'll continue to use dramatic language to point out how morally bankrupt leftists are, thanks. If you don't like it, tough titty. The threat of force against my life is there whether you like to acknowledge it or not.

&gt; Tell me, are you held at gunpoint when you're required to pay the cashier for the stuff you want?
I know you'll tell me ""go ahead and don't pay taxes, see what happen,"" like somehow any other money-for-goods/services transaction doesn't work the same way.

Wal-Mart doesn't kill me if I don't buy food from them. Guess who kills me if I resist arrest for refusing to pay my property taxes?

As with most lefties, you struggle with understanding the difference between coercion and mutual exchange.

&gt; Now I know, you'll say government is bad and that we need to replace all public services with private services, because in libertalia, businesses care about us and the people will hold them accountable, and prevent monopolies from forming.

Literally no one says this except lefties looking for a straw man. Try again.

The government is not bad. Business is not good. Your emotional investment in the parties involved is not a moral defense of your right to my life and the fruits of it.

And the fact that you refuse to acknowledge my right to choose makes it all the more ridiculous that you would be beside yourself with outrage that I *don't care about helping you.*

&gt; But in the real world that doesn't actually happen. We've seen what business does with a lack of regulation, it led to the advent of trust busting in the US. It gave us the diamond monopoly that artificially inflates prices and has tricked the world into thinking diamonds are the only gemstone for marriage.

How about all the monopolies that never would have existed if not for the government? Or do you think Comcast and Time Warner Cable are the only companies interested in selling ISPs in 2017?

&gt; People don't keep businesses in check. But, if you tax them and spread that wealth effectively (not to say the government is efficient in their spending, because they aren't), life gets better for everyone.

Because only aboriginals can meet their comeuppance through overweening pride? Come on man, there are whole genres of western fiction dedicated to the evils of pride.

Absolutely.  I doubt he would have done it if he hadn't thought he was going to win.  But same thing for Brazeau.  They were two adult men who both voluntarily agreed to a friendly boxing match, both fulling expecting they would easily win and get to shave the other person's head.

Eu comecei a brincar com isso quando eu tinha uns 10 ou 11 anos. Não muito mais do que isso. Existia um jogo de política e combate online baseado em turnos chamado Planetarion.

- Rovinj in Croatia is gorgeous, albeit a bit small for multiple days, probably okay as a day-trip.

- Close by, Pula has a nice Roman colosseum and lots of history behind it if you're into that sort of thing. 

- Split has a surprisingly nice old town, and you can take plenty of day-trips to both Krka NP and Plitvice Lakes, in addition to the many islands nearby. The city is the second biggest city in Croatia, though.

- Perast in Montenegro is a short trip north from Kotor. Both cities (or, Perast is a seaside town, really) are lovely. Definitely a highlight of my trip. The fjord is amazing, and if you go, you should definitely walk up Kotor fortress to get a fantastic view of the water.

- Prizren in Kosovo was quite interesting and Ottoman-esque, especially compared to Pristina. The old quarter is so charming to walk around in. 

- Ohrid in Macedonia is a bit on the bigger side, maybe, but it is the number one thing to visit in the country for a reason. The lake is very peaceful. 

- Finally, Bitola is the second biggest city in Macedonia, and has a cool European vibe, definitely worth a quick stop if you're in the area.

&gt; La historia muestra que en la Argentina no hay líder derrotado que no pueda volver a triunfar en la coyuntura adecuada
&gt; 
&gt; [Federico Andahazi](http://bucket1.glanacion.com/anexos/fotos/99/2249999w180.png ""Federico Andahazi"")
&gt; 
&gt; Martes 01 de agosto de 2017
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hay que entender la lógica de las próximas elecciones en la Argentina a la luz de lo que está sucediendo en el continente. Existe un ambicioso plan de fuga hacia adelante encabezado por Nicolás Maduro y los líderes del eje bolivariano extendido. El régimen venezolano, que hoy se muestra como un furioso animal herido de muerte, no parece tener porvenir. Si Maduro cayera derrotado en las elecciones que decidió reemplazar por una aberración jurídica, lo esperaría un futuro tras las rejas. Ningún líder quisiera verse reflejado en ese espejo. Van a defender el régimen a cualquier precio.
&gt; 
&gt; Con el aporte del PC cubano; del flamante presidente ecuatoriano, Lenín Moreno; de Álvaro García Linera, vicepresidente de Bolivia; de sectores del PT acorralados por la justicia, y del kirchnerismo, surgió un imaginativo plan de contraofensiva contra el imperialismo neoliberal. De acuerdo con los viejos postulados de José Carlos Mariátegui, se trataría de establecer una alianza de los trabajadores con los pueblos originarios de América del Sur, especialmente en las zonas andinas y selváticas. Impulsarían así un polo incaico-marxista en la región para abandonar toda frivolidad republicana, que conciben como una rémora del viejo colonialismo español, reencarnado hoy en Estados Unidos. Ése fue el exitoso plan de Evo Morales y de Correa y es la cuerda sobre la cual quiere hacer pie Maduro. Conforme con este programa continental, hoy [Milagro Sala](/milagro-sala-t48768 ""Ver todas las notas de Milagro Sala"") contaría no sólo con el aval de los dirigentes regionales más rebeldes y los rosarios papales, sino también con sus pergaminos de líder de los pueblos originarios. Esta caracterización es la que compró la CIDH al pedir su excarcelación, conmovida por la figura de una presa política morena, ""pobre"" y segregada.
&gt; 
&gt; La consigna ""Liberen a Milagro"" sería la punta de lanza del plan que consistiría en una suerte de 17 de Octubre continental, una pueblada en todas las capitales de América latina que muestre la vitalidad de la Revolución, con la presencia en un acto multitudinario de Evo Morales, Lenín Moreno, Correa, Lula, Raúl Castro, Daniel Ortega y Cristina Kirchner, quien ""abdicaría"" públicamente a favor de Milagro para facilitarle la llegada al poder en 2019. O antes. Con elecciones o sin ellas. Como en Venezuela. La carta al pueblo venezolano que acaba de redactar Sala sería el manifiesto de este nuevo movimiento.
&gt; 
&gt; No corra, querido lector. Esta idea delirante no tiene ningún viso de realidad. Es sólo la fabulación de un escritor para demostrar que hasta la ocurrencia más absurda puede ser verosímil en este país. De hecho, no es del todo original. Está compuesta por retazos de la historia y noticias del presente. La idea del restablecimiento de un imperio incaico fue sostenida por José de San Martín y Manuel Belgrano. Tan variados, lábiles e impredecibles eran los proyectos que antes de imaginar un emperador inca Belgrano y Rivadavia habían viajado a Inglaterra para buscar un rey europeo que gobernara nuestro país. A la luz de estos hechos, la idea anterior no parece descabellada. La política argentina siempre fue imprevisible: el mismo Rivadavia que salió en busca de un monarca terminó siendo el primer presidente de una república.
&gt; 
&gt; El futuro es un enigma. En estos días de encuestas, pronósticos que varían minuto a minuto, apuestas de inversores, empresarios que se comen las uñas, analistas que quieren explicarle a la opinión pública lo que ellos mismos ignoran, en medio de esta incertidumbre general, el Gobierno no colabora con la previsibilidad. Cometió el imperdonable error de colocar a Cristina en el centro de la escena. Hoy nadie piensa en Esteban Bullrich (de hecho, muy pocos saben quién es) ni en Massa ni en Randazzo ni en los cientos de candidatos que se presentan en estas PASO. Todos se concentran en Cristina. Se vota por ella o en contra de ella. Lo consiguió una vez más.
&gt; 
&gt; Tal vez para morigerar la angustia, muchos quieren convencerse de que Cristina está en las mismas condiciones que Carlos Menem antes de que el riojano desertara de la segunda vuelta contra Néstor Kirchner en 2003. Es posible. Pero quién se atrevería a afirmar que la historia se repetirá de la misma exacta manera. Hay que atravesar tres eternidades para develar ese misterio: la que nos separa de las elecciones primarias, luego, las legislativas y, por último, muy lejos, las generales de 2019. ¿Habrá que vivir hasta entonces con el corazón en la boca? No es vida. Nadie eligió este calvario. Durán Barba quiso ocultar la herencia para darnos unos meses de felicidad y nos dejó cuatro años de zozobra.
&gt; 
&gt; La mayoría de los presidentes argentinos no parecían destinados a serlo. Perón era un militar que no sólo carecía de los títulos para ser presidente: no tenía abolengo siquiera para llegar a ser oficial. Por sus venas corría sangre india, su padre no lo reconoció y su madre era soltera en la época en la que los oficiales del ejército debían tener sangre azul y paladar negro. Perón volvió de la muerte política una y otra vez. La primera vez que lo dieron por muerto fue cuando lo encarcelaron en la isla Martín García. Desde el 17 de octubre de 1945 jamás dejó de resucitar, aun sepultado. Paradojas de la historia: Perón nació a la política escoltando al general Uriburu en el estribo del auto con el que llegó a la Casa Rosada, mediante el derrocamiento de un presidente constitucional. Fue uno de los cerebros del GOU, artífice del golpe militar de 1943, y vicepresidente de facto. Pero nada impidió que pudiera participar en elecciones libres. Ventajas que otorga la democracia, incluso a los que no creen en ella.
&gt; 
&gt; Tal vez la presidente menos esperada de la historia haya sido María Estela Martínez de Perón. Ignota bailarina exótica en la compañía de Joe Herald en un cabaret de Panamá, aficionada al espiritismo, carente de cualquier interés en la política, el azar la puso en la fórmula presidencial Perón-Perón y, mal que le pese a Cristina, ""Isabelita"" fue la primera mujer en alcanzar la presidencia, gracias a la voluntad popular y la muerte de su esposo, con el 62% de los votos.
&gt; 
&gt; Los argentinos no somos originales ni siquiera en imprevisibilidad. ¿Quién conocía a Obama meses antes de que fuera presidente de Estados Unidos? Su nombre remitía al de Osama ben Laden, el mayor enemigo de George Bush. ¿Quién podía vaticinar que Donald Trump, ese personaje bufonesco de pelo anaranjado que hasta hace poco veíamos en TV, llegaría adonde llegó? ¿Quién hubiera dicho que Angela Merkel, una mujer formada en la Alemania comunista, sería quien condujera la economía capitalista más poderosa de Europa? ¿Quién hubiese apostado una moneda al flamante presidente de Francia, el desconocido Emmanuel Macron?
&gt; 
&gt; Al contrario de los presidentes que llegaron de manera inesperada, están aquellos que parecían tener todo para serlo y jamás lo lograron. Y los que se prepararon toda su vida para la presidencia y, cuando la alcanzaron, se convirtieron en su propia caricatura, como Fernando de la Rúa. La política es la más impredecible de las ciencias. Es posible calcular la trayectoria de un asteroide y torcer su rumbo con un misil. Pero todavía es imposible torcer la insondable voluntad popular. Ahí vamos a las urnas, atrapados por la eterna antinomia peronismo-antiperonismo que el Gobierno decidió actualizar en la antítesis cristinismo-anticristinismo. Cara o ceca.

1. Dynamic Events more like FSAE - Move E-Accel to Tech, Run Skidpad, Shorten Endurance - right now Endurance length awards going LESS electrical than more.

2. Move Competition.

3. I think voltage rules are fine.

I very much like the suggestion for a spec car and like the suggestion for a base chassis and suspension more than a base drivetrain. If that doesn't help in the next couple years, then try moving to a base drivetrain design.  

Now for a nitpick that is definitely me reading too far into something but still feeling the butthurt from years ago...
&gt;I have very little experience with high level European teams, aside from the Italian team that competed with Formula Hybrid a few years ago. Although they blew the other teams out of the water, they still got a little hung up in tech, although that was before a large rules restructuring and simplification. In any case, they unfortunately did not return, and did not seem thrilled during the competition.

I've never understood why FH organizers and competitors want to dismiss A&amp;M's philosophy or efforts. A&amp;M lost by 3.4 points that year. I wouldn't call that blowing other competitors out of the water. Is there some reason current officials don't want to encourage A&amp;M's approach? I don't get it, especially when we're talking about letting teams use spec designs.

If you believe Germany would've treated the natives in the colonies like a German civilian if they hadn't lost them in the first place, you are an idiot.

denica28,,,"I have to say that you argue very well. And I do agree that the US gets the shorter end of the stick a lot of the times (I think that's how the expression goes). 
The UN and NATO both have their problems, and the fact that the US is paying so much is one of them. 

But I do have to disagree with some things. 

China has strengthened its environmental laws. Whether they will work or not is another topic, but at least they are admitting the problem, and trying to do something about it. 
Trump, on the other hand, denied that climate change exists and called it a hoax. Although his mind may have been changed since then, his stance is still unknown, and it is unsure how that'll affect the US' environmental regulations. But for now it seems they will become less strict, and instead let corporations do their thing. That does not bid well for the environment. 

The state of the so-called ""subpar"" healthcare depends on the country. There's still much room for improvement. But to say that the fact that the US pays for much of the UN's and NATO's budget is what allows for European countries to provide healthcare, is ridiculous. Each country in NATO is only supposed to meet a threshold of 2% of its GDP as its contribution to the organization. The contribution to the UN if the US paid as much as everyone else instead of more, although substantial, is not enough to have to stop government-provided healthcare and education.
Whether one would want the government to provide for its people ""from cradle to grave"" is a personal preference, and may not necessarily be a bad thing. But then again, that's subjective, and depends on the country you live in. 


I never said that the US isn't capable of taking isolationist policies or even manage on its own, although I think that the quality of life would sink dramatically in that case . I thought that you denied the fact that the US was part of a global market, which was something that surprised me.


I didn't say that is was 50/50 either. What I meant is that you can't deny the fact that the US would be strongly affected if there was a big economic crisis across Europe or parts of Asia, and vice versa. 


We don't know whether NK has developed a nuclear weapon. And the whole situation with China that is kinda but not really supporting NK because it doesn't want the country to be invaded by American soldiers, makes the whole situation very delicate. It's therefore worrying to have someone unpredictable like Trump having such a big say in this situation. 
As my country is a member of NATO, we would have a duty to assist the US if they ever suffered an attack from NK, which, although unlikely, isn't impossible. I'm not worried that NK is going to nuke Europe, but more that my country will be dragged into war on NK grounds. 


Saying that Trump ""tells it like it is"" is a very bold claim. He has constantly said things that are untrue, he has lied about how the wall between the US and Mexico is going to be built (and how much it will cost). He held back information about his tax returns, and because of that he doesn't seem trustworthy. Although politicians aren't exactly the most trustworthy people, Trump still manages to stand out from the mass. 


Even though Trump has sponsored some organisations that support women, he has still come out with very sexist comments. He has often talked about women by berating their looks, he's said that women who have had breast reductions are insane, in 2011 he sent a female journalist who spoke badly of him the article in question, with her face circled and a note saying ""the face of a dog"". In August 2015, he was questioned about his sexism by yet another female journalist, whom he later called a bimbo and said that her questioning was a result of her menstruation. His conduct on the Miss USA pageant is also despicable. Not to mention the whole ""grab women by the pussy""-video. He's said that that was just gym talk, but that is no excuse for what he said. 
Giving money for charity to support women, means little when accompanied by such statements. 

I can't say much about liberals in the US, as alot of it seems crazy to me too, especially when it comes to white privilege and the like, but Trump has definitely come with racist remarks, especially against Muslims. Although I can understand that Muslims in the US is a complicated topic and definitely a controversial one, grouping a race of people together is rarely a good idea. Trump has been sued twice by the Department of Justice for not renting to minorities, he has still refused to condemn white supremacist groups, instead avoiding questions with vague statements. Plus there was this whole scandal about him saying that Obama may not have been born in the US. 
That's not to say that the media hasn't been biased and hasn't exaggerated many of the comments. It definitely has, and they do like to put Trump in a bad light. But Trump has still said and done many of these things, and that is unacceptable for someone who holds such a highly regarded position. 


And what exactly is happening closer to our soil that the US is going to have to fix? The one time that the NATO's article about uniting against a common enemy has been used, was after 9/11 when the US asked others to join it in the fight against terrorism. It's unlikely that NK is going to attack Europe directly, if it's going to go for someone, it's going to be the US. And in that case, the US will be the one to ask the rest of NATO's members to join the fight yet again.

We had a promotion of code--oh about 6 years ago?--I sat around with 20-30 or so, discussing a bunch of things.  Sharia law, or how they phrased it--their religious law--came up.  They said they are more beholden to God's law than America's.  These are some people that have been here for many years.  They talked about marrying off their daughters in arranged marriages at age 14 or earlier.  They bitched that they couldn't stop work and pray, because we had deadlines during the day.  Some told me they didn't prostrate themselves, but just backed away from the keyboard, or disconnected meetings, to do it.  That they couldn't take time to read the Koran as much as they wanted.

They talked about how horrible it was to work with the many, many gays that are in my field (healthcare), and that they couldn't stand seeing two men or two women act as couples.  So much so that they fought to keep their violence in.

And that they couldn't wait for their family and friends to join them here and turn this country into a nirvana--money, but with their religious teachings at the core.

I can appreciate your stance on wanting them removed, but approaching it from that aspect is a weak argument.

It should be noted that the statue isn't dedicated to any one man...it's dedicated to soldiers who fought in the war. That's an important distinction. There are a plethora of Nazi memorials all over Europe that are dedicated to the individual soldiers and NOT to the Nazi party/movement itself. As long as those memorials don't become a mecca for Neo-Nazi's they tend to be left where they are.

The soldiers who fought, largely didn't own slaves. Some of them may not have even supported slavery. Some of them fought because they felt their homes and families were in danger from Union troops (Sherman was burning through GA and raping and pillaging were widespread concerns...most of those Union generals went on to become the heinous assholes who committed genocide against the Native Americans a few years later). Some of them likely fought because they supported slavery and/or states rights though.

The problem, is due to who erected the statue (likely some Confederate revisionist group) and what their intent was. The statue is a memorial to war veterans; no matter how you look at it. Does that mean it should be in a museum or in a veterans park?  Maybe.

But at some point, especially here in Texas, we're going to have to draw a line in the sand. Are we going to rename every street, building, park, etc?  I mean...the Texas Revolution was fought, in large part, to preserve slavery. Has this councilman also proposed to rename the park? Travis Park is, after all, named after William B. Travis...a slave owner. For this councilman to overlook this is in his crusade is, in my opinion, shortsighted. 

It makes me think that he's not really concerned with the statue at all, or at least not genuine about it, and he may be more concerned about making a name for himself by using a current social justice warrior push against confederate statues/white supremacy.",True,False,,0,1501614115,,False,0,dl0x0uh,False,t3_6qweao,t1_dl0fz8f,1503677336,1,False,texas,t5_2qho4,

ChillandBreath,,,"&gt; You have no right to that land any more. 

Palestinian people's are obliviously indigenous to places 1000 miles east. Saudi Arabia, Syria, etc. You can use the last name to trace the origin.

Israel is the world’s first modern indigenous state: the creation and declaration of the sovereign nation of Israel marks the first time in history that an indigenous people has managed to regain control of its ancestral lands and build a nation state.

Jews are UN approved indigenous peoples and as such so are native Americans.

Regardless of the length of the timeframe of Jewish depopopulation events, Jews have the right to live there under indigenous pretexts. They have the right to live there without threats about thievery on lands for which they are indigenous to.

Some Palestinians share common ancestry with indigenous peoples, but they neither follow indigenous traditions nor do they self-identify as those indigenous peoples. They share neither religion nor language with them. Blood quantum alone is insufficient to transmit indigenous status.

If conquerors, such as the Palestinian Arabs, can become indigenous, then the white Europeans who came to my indigenous lands in North America could now claim to be indigenous. The white Europeans who went to Australia and New Zealand could now claim to be indigenous. If we, even once, allow that argument to be made, indigenous rights are suddenly devalued and meaningless. This is somewhat peculiar, as those who are arguing for Palestinian “indigenous rights” are usually those who have little grasp of the history, and no understanding of the truth behind indigenous rights.

Israel was always considered home for Jews. Way before Zionism, Jews have made the trip to the Land. The yearning for Zion and Jerusalem has been a fixed part of Judaism and has been part of the daily prayers ever since the destruction of the second Temple.

This denial of Jewish peoplehood is an inherent part of the argument that Zionism is colonialism. And such denial is, in fact, antisemitic.

ChildOfComplexity,,Anti-racist is code for anti-reddit,"It's fine to be a rootless cosmopolitan. It's just not an option for everyone, it doesn't work for everyone. 

And if you have people hungering for an identity and all they can find is ""white"", that's an empty hollow thing. Because guess what. ""white culture"" -was- liberal culture. It was based on the logic/propaganda that Europeans were inherently ""civilised"", that civilisation (or whatever equally problematic term you want to use) , democracy, the rule of law etc were the birthright of the ""white race"", and set them apart from other ethnic groups. And it was a tenable position (if you employed the same kind of logic that sees Trump at 35% popular support) when (outside of Europe) there were still nations that were mostly made up of small tribal groups, living in traditional housing, no electricity, no mass media (not even film or radio), etc. So it could still be believed by a majority in 1950, 1930, 1910, 1890 and so on back till the nation state, the rule of law, central government etc were only found in Europe (at least as far as most Europeans were aware).

But the world we live in today is a world post-modernisation, where almost every country has been brought into the sphere of consumer culture, electricity, TV, and increasingly computers, etc are phenomenon ubiquitous to every nation where they haven't be explicitly rejected. There is no town on earth where you won't find a significant amount of literate people, There are less nations on earth where you could sweepingly qualify the population as ""sustenance farmers"" or ""hunter gatherers"" than there are communist nations.

The world has changed, the things that comprised ""white"" identity can no longer even be dreamed of, let alone claimed, as belonging to ""white"" people. So those left with nothing but their whiteness to cling to have no way to assert it but to gatekeep their social position through hate and violence. 

That's where we are. There has to be a solution. But it's not pretending there is no problem. 

To give some context to the problem we are faced with, there is a book ""Aspects of Modern Sociology: Patterns of Urban Life"", that deals with social relations in England in the 50's and 60's. In it there is a chapter that talks about the difficulties the aspirational urban middle class moving to villages for their rustic charm have in integrating with the local population. It posits there are two kinds of ""villager"" (for want of a better term) that is predisposed to reject the encroachment of these outsiders (before taking various structural things about how the social interactions of these groups play out into account). The left wing radicalised working class, for obvious reasons, and the right wing ""traditionalist"", because of the outsiders lack of understanding of the traditional role the wealthy play in village life, i.e. their failure to meet unspoken social obligations. 

My point here is that in ""white"" society there is a similar right-wing ""traditional"" (I use this term only to carry the idea from the last paragraph, not to grant their views any value) group, who people who have internalised liberal values don't understand, and who don't understand liberals. Education seems like the obvious solution, but large portions of this group will explicitly reject it, and I don't see a world, operating under the current social structures, where there is even the political will to seriously -attempt- to educate them. 

So what other solutions can be imagined? Decoupling class status from whiteness might work, though I can't even  begin to imagine how that would be achieved (especially within the framework of capitalism). The other option is remaking the myths that underpin whiteness. Discussing them does this, slowly, and in an unguided manner, but the most obvious direction to go if you were to attack it in a pointed manner is to what immediately preceded ""whiteness"". Another possible direction is working to integrate white identities within the framework of multiculturalism, which would require a reorienting of the myths that underpin multiculturalism -and- education on multiculturalism amongst the white population, but both of those seem like smaller hurdles to overcome than some other approaches, given that the right has nothing coherent to offer on the subject of multiculturalism, just crude growls of no substance.",True,False,,1,1501615511,,1501616542,0,dl0ydmx,False,t3_6qvy9j,t1_dl0l0ls,1503678024,5,False,GamerGhazi,t5_33oia,

The reason most countries have their own ""style"" of engineering is born from the restrictions that were put in place and the individual circumstances around.

The Japanese try to keep engine sizes under 2.0 litre due to taxation reasons, for example the Subaru Impreza STI Engine was changed to a 2.5 for the American market because Americans like torque (possibly emissions related too) but to this day the Japanese *still* use the 2.0 instead of the 2.5 the rest of the world uses.

In America, diesel is not as available as Petrol so Americans use petrol trucks with big V8s for Torque and well, if you've already made a V8, might as well throw it in a car rather than spend money developing a new engine and like you said fuel costs aren't that much of a concern.

If anything, America got it right where the rest of Europe fucked up, we ran off and married the diesel engine and now we find out that she's a lying cheating dirty whore. All that time trying to make Diesel the savior of greenhouse gases wasted and it took away time that could've been spent developing alternative fuel methods.

Relevant excerpts:

&gt;The scarcity, Mukherjee writes, was caused by large-scale exports of food from India for use in the war theatres and consumption in Britain - India exported more than 70,000 tonnes of rice between January and July 1943, even as the famine set in. This would have kept nearly 400,000 people alive for a full year. Mr Churchill turned down fervent pleas to export food to India citing a shortage of ships - this when shiploads of Australian wheat, for example, would pass by India to be stored for future consumption in Europe. As imports dropped, prices shot up and hoarders made a killing. **Mr Churchill also pushed a scorched earth policy - which went by the sinister name of Denial Policy - in coastal Bengal where the colonisers feared the Japanese would land. So authorities removed boats (the lifeline of the region) and the police destroyed and seized rice stocks.**

&gt; ...

&gt; The famine ended at the end of the year when survivors harvested their rice crop. The first shipments of barley and wheat reached those in need only in November, by which time tens of thousands had already perished. **Throughout the autumn of 1943, the United Kingdom's food and raw materials stockpile for its 47 million people - 14 million fewer than that of Bengal - swelled to 18.5m tonnes.**

[Time magazine article](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2031992,00.html)

Relevant excerpts:

&gt; In 1943, some 3 million brown-skinned subjects of the Raj died in the Bengal famine, one of history's worst. Mukerjee delves into official documents and oral accounts of survivors to paint a horrifying portrait of how Churchill, as part of the Western war effort, ordered the diversion of food from starving Indians to already well-supplied British soldiers and stockpiles in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, including Greece and Yugoslavia. And he did so with a churlishness that cannot be excused on grounds of policy: **Churchill's only response to a telegram from the government in Delhi about people perishing in the famine was to ask why Gandhi hadn't died yet.**

&gt; ...

&gt; British imperialism had long justified itself with the pretense that it was conducted for the benefit of the governed. Churchill's conduct in the summer and fall of 1943 gave the lie to this myth. **""I hate Indians,"" he told the Secretary of State for India, Leopold Amery. ""They are a beastly people with a beastly religion."" The famine was their own fault, he declared at a war-cabinet meeting, for ""breeding like rabbits.""**

&gt; ...

&gt; some of India's grain was also exported to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to meet needs there, even though the island wasn't experiencing the same hardship; Australian wheat sailed past Indian cities (where the bodies of those who had died of starvation littered the streets) to depots in the Mediterranean and the Balkans; and offers of American and Canadian food aid were turned down. India was not permitted to use its own sterling reserves, or indeed its own ships, to import food. And because the British government paid inflated prices in the open market to ensure supplies, grain became unaffordable for ordinary Indians. **Lord Wavell, appointed Viceroy of India that fateful year, considered the Churchill government's attitude to India ""negligent, hostile and contemptuous.""**",True,False,,0,1501615903,,False,0,dl0yr47,False,t3_6qvzwe,t1_dl0y2qf,1503678210,9,False,Drama,t5_2rd2l,

ELY25,,,"**The crisis of regional order in the Gulf**

*An approach that ignores the demands and desires of people is destined to fail to produce a new coherent regional order.*

by: Prof Dr Ahmet Davutoglu
Former Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Turkey and a Member of Parliament from the AK Party, Turkey


At a time when the Middle East is in dire need of a positive agenda and a plan to overcome division, ominous new developments are dominating the scene and the forces of disintegration appear to have been unleashed.

The current ""Gulf"" crisis is just the latest manifestation of this trend. Before considering the way out of this crisis, it is important to accurately depict it, its root causes, and its regional implications.

There have been many depictions of the Qatari crisis, and several different names have been used to describe the nature of the issue.

""The Qatari crisis"", ""the Gulf crisis"", ""the contest to define a new regional order"", and ""the latest chapter of the Arab Spring showdown"" have all been employed on various occasions to describe the crisis.

These are all valid descriptions contingent upon observers' own operational logic. In fact, the politics of naming a crisis is no frivolous endeavour.

They shed light on the political position of the intellectual or informed observer of the crisis, and hence also inform us of how the situation is being read and what formulas are being offered to solve it.

Exhausting competition

This crisis is neither a bilateral crisis between Qatar and its Gulf Arab neighbours, nor a geographically isolated dispute confined to the Gulf region.

Instead it is a regional crisis - the direct outcome of the lack of a sustainable regional order in the Middle East.

The lack of a sustainable and legitimate regional order has undergirded the menacing rivalries and exhausting competition, creating a cycle of zero-sum games in the region.

This lose-lose logic defines the basic premises of most inter-state relations as well as state-society relations in the region at present, becoming the hallmark of regional affairs in recent years.

Since enmities, suspicions, insecurities, and deadly rivalries have come to define the nature of regional interactions, borders started to represent not points of connection but barriers between peoples, societies, ideas, and states. In a sense, borders transformed into separation walls.

Such suspicions, misreadings, and exaggerated ideas of looming threats have ushered in a ""siege mentality"" at the level of political elites across the region, and this in return lays the groundwork for proactive plotting, bullying and aggressive politics.

The root cause of this ""siege mentality"", as well as the paranoid nature of this political conduct, lies in the glaring gap between the people and the ruling elites.

Such a crisis of legitimacy at the level of political elites and the stark contrast between the aspirations of the people and the projections of the political class forms the backbone of all major crises in the region. This in return inhibits any fruitful engagement among states and societies at regional level.

Naturally, this condition has a deleterious effect on regional cooperation and integration. The reason for this is clear: institutions follow intentions and shared values.

Sound institutions

Political actors devoid of popular legitimacy cannot act with the goodwill which would pave the ground for sound institutions that can produce public goods for both individual societies as well as the region at large.

Therefore, solving the legitimacy crisis of regional political actors is essential for mechanisms of intentions and institutions to develop and function.

A successful model in this aspect is the European integration project. When analysing the intentions of the founding fathers of the European project, one thing that becomes clear is that they were all committed to the idea of European integration and of restructuring the nature of relations among themselves in a mutually beneficial way; hence a win-win logic was at play.

Moreover, these political elites could clearly see the interdependency of the national and regional contexts.

Likewise, equipped with popular legitimacy, they also shared similar values in terms of order in the state, society and region - a factor that contributed enormously towards the establishment of a common security community through the European integration project.

Proto-regional order

Over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries, the closest the Middle East has come to creating a legitimate proto-regional order was arguably the year 2012, where it seems that certain societal energies and demands began shaping political processes, which in return would have provided the necessary ideational foundation and political security for political elites to embark on establishing a new regional order should the process have been successful.

Yet this process was aborted.

Today, the Middle East is sorely lacking the aforementioned qualities of the founding fathers of the European project. Likewise, the American leadership’s stance on this crisis has been all but visionary as well.

The dual nature of the American policy, one represented by Donald Trump or the White House and the other by the institutions, have only aggravated the crisis. Such disparate policies adopted by the different components of the US government are contributing to the Gulf's insecurity.

This policy inspires neither confidence nor trust among American allies. The US needs to adopt a responsible common policy aiming at the de-escalation of the crisis.

Going back to the Middle East and putting it differently, the region is in search of visionary statements, equipped with popular legitimacy, which can project beyond the calamities of the present and above the particularities of their own national contexts.

Political elites must learn to envisage a mutually beneficial regional order in which the welfare of one nation will be dependent on the larger regional context.

Hence achieving a state of regional good which can be seen not only as an altruistic endeavour, but also as a self-serving action.

Logic of interdependency

In such a scenario, the blockade of Qatar would have been inconceivable, because the logic of interdependency would have militated against such a move. This is intimately tied to the existence of a functioning regional order.

But it isn't only the lack of a regional order that aggravates regional grievances or feuds.

The fact that the region lacks institutions or frameworks that can govern these grievances or serve to channel feuds into diplomatic and political processes should also be an issue of major concern.

But this deficiency is not surprising. As discussed above, institutions are the product of intentions, and intentions are mostly shaped by actors' perceptions, and hence their political psychologies, which are in turn formed mainly by their level of socio-political legitimacy.

In the region, political elites are driven by dormant fears and active paranoias - or troubled political psychologies - and are ill-placed to initiate the process of establishing a legitimate regional order.

Later on when the cold war started the Russians had superior jet fighters, compared to the Americans. And they based their designs on the stuff they copied from Rolls Royce. In the civilian field, the Brits produced the first commercial jet airliner, de Haviland Comet, followed by the first supersonic jet airliner, the Concorde. In the industry, the Americans were always rivaled by the Europeans and the Russians, and the science part was largely driven by the old world countries.

Barnabe990,,,"Voltando em alguns tópicos que passaram em brancas nuvens:

Realismo inocente tem aquele que não dispõe de um referencial sólido. Baseando-se apenas no aprendido e no copiado de estudo erudito, é claro que tudo se torna relativo. O referencial muda de acordo com o aprimoramento ou o enrijecimento do conhecimento que se tem do ambiente material e das espécies que ai convivem.

Mas isso é diferente quando se adota para base dessas avaliações nos nossos caminhos as Leis básicas da Criação. Nesse caso “existem” paradigmas sólidos a partir dos quais se pode construir. Também em bases sólidas. Por isso palavras como “sempre”, “nunca”, passam a ter um significado, enquanto antes com os arroubos do raciocínio elas eram apenas reflexos do mencionado ""realismo inocente"" de quem não sabe caminhar numa experimentação com os próprios talentos. E tateando apenas  pode sentir tudo com fazendo parte de uma temporalidade que vai mudar assim que novos dados forem obtidos.

Quando se tem como base as Leis da Criação os novos dados dão apenas mais clareza, aprofundamento, mas, em tudo, confirmam o caminho tomado até ali. 

As suas dúvidas até são pertinentes, pois você partiu do raciocínio humano. Este nem na matemática pode ser toda vez objetivo. Pois o que é a verdade não pode ser apreendido com o raciocínio sobre o qual a matemática se debruça. Marcus Aurelius está correto dentro do sufocante ambiente da prisão do raciocínio. O que ele não consegue abranger é porque é assim!

Pense no trabalho que os Enteais que administram o tapete da reciprocidade humana têm na construção das monstruosidades que esses mesmos seres humanos com afinco produzem. E isso se encaixa perfeitamente até às minúcias também nos desvãos das imperfeitas leis humanas. 

Agora imagine tudo o que o ser humano fez de errado desde o momento que passou a absorver o princípio de Lúcifer e devido a isso foi se acorrentando cada vez mais fortemente no espaço-tempo, perdendo a conexão que teve com o espiritual. Dessa forma tudo aquilo que como obstáculo pesa como pressão de expiação barra no caso daquele mendigo a visão clara da sua própria situação. Com isso os próprios supostos prejuízos que você está considerando partirem da sociedade e das “injustiças” da organização societária humana, contribuem para colocar na frente dele tudo aquilo do que ele precisa para reconhecer seus erros. Ele os vê na sua frente. Desprezo, nojo, falta de consideração, penúria, mentira, logro, não me toques, pária, entre tantos outros. E isso é o que ele precisa para lá do fundo de sua alma, clamar para sair desse ambiente opressor e limitante. Não antes, mesmo que você vai lá e conta isso para ele. Vai faltar o reconhecimento caso ele não esteja suficientemente calejado com a baixeza, o desprezo, ou o que mais ele precisa para o reconhecimento.

Mesmo que você não permaneça ao redor dele, essas ações de retorno vão colocar na sua frente tudo de que ele precisa e no momento certo até uma mão amiga. Dessa forma não é semântica ele estar na situação em que se encontra. E jamais ele é uma vitima da situação. Pois pensar nisso é não acreditar que as Leis auto-ativas do Criador funcionam. Eu sei que elas funcionam, mas a certeza somente você mesmo pode tentar reconhecer através da experiência pessoal. Aliás a Verdade é uma experiência absolutamente pessoal, mesmo que o seu raciocínio queira encontrar uma saída para essa afirmação.

Quando eu afirmo que a justiça humana é imperfeita me baseio no fato de que essa mesma lei apenas consegue “ver” e se “ater” apenas aos desdobramentos materiais de uma ação humana e JAMAIS aos seus inícios que estão fora da matéria grosseira. E sem considerar o início, os porquês, e as espécies que estão em jogo a administração dessa justiça (em minúsculo mesmo) é totalmente falha. Mas as ações de retorno também se estendem á administração dessa justiça. É só você imaginar a quantidade de sentenças errôneas que no passado, na falta de meios de averiguação culminaram com erros judiciais colocando “inocentes” na cadeia, por exemplo, (aqui novamente um trabalho de logística para fazer casar o erro judicial com alguém que estava precisando dessa experiência pessoalmente).

Cada pessoa sente precisamente o certo e o errado, assim que ela escuta sua voz interior. O espírito sabe. Mas a capa que o encobre dos erros surgidos pelo exercício de sua própria vontade, não deixa aquela certeza vir a tona. Você mesmo já teve esse tipo de experiência. Quando se apresenta uma situação inesperada, você sente. Mas, imediatamente o raciocínio toma a dianteira e coloca inúmeras possibilidades, que vão turvando o reconhecimento do fenômeno como certo ou errado e ao trazer tudo para o ambiente material tudo se torna relativo e o certo e errado escapa, fica borrado. Como no sonho em um momento você consegue sentir a totalidade e no momento seguinte o cérebro diurno já fez a confusão. A partir daí nada é definitivo, mas, tudo se torna confuso, e sujeito a várias possibilidades. Quanto mais você pensa mais fica sem rumo. Todos os argumentos que você arrola para a malícia, a estupidez e a ignorância são absolutamente frutos do raciocínio. Pense no produto de cada uma dessas características. São frutos podres, e o que é correto não gera produtos podres. A figueira não pode gerar fruto podre (no sentido figurado), como a urtiga. Mas, a urtiga pode sim gerar fruto ruim que ao ser trabalhado gera extratos úteis em cosmética, por exemplo. Porém no geral são frutos ruins se não forem manipulados da forma adequada (de novo em sentido figurado) provocam apenas dano.

Quando você analisa um fenômeno, pode tirar disso ensinamentos. No sentido apontado por Jesus de “quem procura acha”, quem “bate à porta ela se abre”. Isto é, você tem que se esforçar que o conhecimento virá. Você ainda não entendeu a diferença entre ""analisar"" e ""julgar"". Nisso não posso ajudar. Cada um tem que fazer o esforço por si. E com isso o esclarecimento vai surgindo com a ampliação dos horizontes. Figuradamente é o subir numa montanha onde os horizontes vão se ampliando. Mas a subida tem esforço. E relativamente aos “vieses” pense qual dos vieses é o “correto”, o “melhor”. Mas não deixe o seu raciocínio dominar sua análise de novo. Pois o ÚNICO viés que é relevante é justamente aquele que nos aponta as “Leis da Criação”. Qualquer outro somente tem alguma relevância parcial no ambiente material e somente aí o raciocínio pode apresentar um viés mais relevante desde que “conduzido” pela voz interior, e NUNCA quando ele toma a si a escolha dos caminhos.

Quanto a dar uma surra, me parece que a situação foi para demonstrar que agir com amor tem que estar permeado de severidade e não da moleza tão comum entre cristãos e espíritas, por exemplo, conforme se verifica nos seus escritos e respectivas ações. Mas, você já sabe que essa severidade tem que vir acompanhada de justiça. E sim, se o caso merecer uma surra isso derruba um recalcitrante, orgulhoso e o faz repensar suas atitudes. Não quer isso dizer que aquele mendigo em especial merecesse uma surra. Pensei quando usei o argumento da severidade que você pudesse olhar pela janela e verificar a paisagem onde o argumento foi colocado e se encaixava, mas, não que se pudesse perder na cortina. Ninguém pode ser ajudado se ele não quiser e a acomodação a um modo de agir pode fazer um reconhecimento de uma situação que nos prende à matéria perdurar muito tempo. Justamente aqui onde o que é bom anda ao lado do que é mais limitado. Depois quando a gente vai para a matéria fina ali pela igualdade reinante a pessoa vai viver muito tempo no inferno que ela semeou enquanto estava aqui e nas outras vidas já vividas. Não vai existir na linha de visão daquele, um exemplo bom para ajudar na reflexão, que ali nem existe. Por isso é tão importante aproveitar nosso tempo aqui em baixo. E somente nesse sentido é que a surra pode ter efeito de despertar, alguém que está com as premissas voltadas apenas para o que é material.

Por outro lado estude um pouco o que é “convicção”. E não utilize esse conceito para aplicar sobre alguém que “estuda a fundo algum tipo de escrito”. Estudar não proporciona convicção. Ela apenas vêm através da experiência vivencial. Você sabe disso. Pessoas que estudam a fundo um escrito, somente podem chegar à convicção quando usam “as Leis da Criação” como balizas desse estudo e depois aplicam o que estudaram em todas as suas consequências para poder atingir o estado de “convicção”. Assim concordo com você de que aqueles que pensam que tem “convicção” quando eles apenas tem erudição atrapalham mais do que ajudam. Pois eles em verdade “não tem convicção”. Daí você precisar refletir para distinguir as duas situações. 

Mas, não desanime, nas redes sociais também se pode espalhar o conhecimento da verdade, pois a Lei da Atração da Igual Espécie funciona! Aquele que tem a igual espécie, tanto vai ser “conduzido” até chegar ali como vai ser atraído. E ao ser atingido pela informação vai sentir dentro de si a igualdade como um reflexo. Ele vai ser ""tocado"". Os outros mesmo que se lhes dissesse que ""aquilo veio do Filho do Homem"" não iriam ser atingidos. E a igualdade que não surge de dentro logo faz cansar e vai procurar sua igual espécie em outro local.

Assim, estude melhor o que é “convicção”. Não use essa palavra para qualquer conhecimento adquirido.

Smögen is an example of the new breed of ""craft"" whisky distillers setting up operations in Sweden. Established in 2009 by a young couple in the coastal region of Bohuslän, it is of course only recently that their whiskies have become available for sale (well, “available” for those in-the-know in that part of the world). Smögen currently only has capacity for about 35,000 litres per year. So it will be some time before these show up more widely, I expect.

I received these two samples of Smögen whisky from a swap with Whisky Saga’s Thomas Øhrbom earlier this year.

Single cask whisky, laid down in 2011 (#7/2011). Bottled at cask strength of 57.3% ABV. This 4 year old Smögen whisky was fully matured in a first-fill Sauternes barrique cask. Sauternes is a French sweet wine made from white grapes of the Bordeaux region, and barriques barrels are relatively tall and have a capacity of 225 litres.

The Smögen website has a fair amount of info on this bottling. The malt batch for this barrel was based on the Optic barley strain, dried to at least 45 ppm phenol content. The whisky was distilled on March 11, 2011, and bottled on March 28th, 2015.  It was released in August of 2015, with limited Nordic/UK distribution (and immediately sold out). The total out-turn was 429 bottles of 500 mL size (so, not a lot of share for the Angels here!).

**Nose**:  Sweet peat with a slight medicinal twist. Wood smoke. Main fruits are dark-skinned plums and grapes, plus some tropical “green” notes (papaya in particular). Very woody, but with dried spruce, juniper and other conifers in addition to the usual oak. Menthol, camphor. Reminds me of some Mackmyra expressions (i.e., very Swedish presentation, especially of the oak). Salt and pepper, with some exotic spices (miso?). Mild off notes, reminiscent of Islays (i.e., a bit funky). It is clear that this is a heavily peated whisky that has spent time in a concentrated sweet wine cask.

**Palate**: Very honeyed sweetness in the mouth. Honey is really the overwhelming initial characteristic (must be from the sauternes casks). This is followed by rich caramel and peat (producing an almost burnt caramel taste, thanks to the smoke). Those dark-skinned plums and grapes show up next. Chocolate. Traditional wood spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. Anise. Pepper with a touch of chilli powder. Very luxurious mouthfeel, almost syrupy at 57.3%. But you can surprisingly still easily drink this one neat. A bit of bitterness creeps it after a few sips, but it is mild. Impressive presentation, lots going on here.

**Finish**: Long, with the woody characteristics coming back and lingering. A mix of chocolate and caramel, with the wood smoke there to round out.  Quite pleasant.

With water, the fragrant conifer notes are enhanced on the nose (frankly, it becomes a bit too woody). In the mouth, water doesn’t have much of an effect on the flavours, but it does lighten the mouthfeel. On the finish, it seems to enhance the burnt caramel. As a result, I recommend you drink this one neat for best effect. If do you try adding any water, go very sparingly.

A real in your face, balls-to-the-wall kind of whisky, with a few rough edges – but still very enjoyable. Not exactly an everyday sipper, but a great experience – and one that has me curious to try other Smogen whiskies.

**Score: 87**

**Smögen 4 Year Old Sherry Project 1:4**

Smögen Sherry Project 1:4 is the fourth and final installment of the Smögen Sherry Project series. The earlier batches (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) had limited – but increasing – finishing time in sherry casks. Sherry Project 1:4 is fully matured in first-fill sherry quarter casks, allowing collectors of the whole series to see how sherry finishing influences the final product.

Smögen Sherry Project 1:4 is a 4 year old whisky, and is bottled at cask strength (57.2% ABV). The whisky was distilled in July 2011, and bottled in August 2015.  Its entire storage life was spent in four Sherry quarter casks, of European oak. It was released in November 2015, and the entire 640 bottle official release sold out within a few minutes. In total there were 909 bottles from the out-turn (of 500 mL size). It was sold for 921 SEK (about $145 CAD).

**Nose**:  Somewhat restrained nose, especially compared to the single cask Smogen I recently reviewed. The peat is there, along with some medicinal funk, but it is subtle. Light wood smoke. For fruits, mainly dried red fruits, some berries and a few raisins. Tobacco. Peanuts and pine nuts. I’m getting some of those conifer notes again, but mild.  It is nice, but a little shy.

**Palate**: Packs a heftier punch on the palate than the nose indicated, with immediate peat and wood smoke, as well as some ethanol heat (i.e., feels the 57.2% ABV here). Lots of caramel and vanilla. Tobacco again, and even more wood spice, plus the pepper and chilies that I found on the single cask sample. Mouthfeel is good, with a lingering syrupiness that just makes you want to hold it in your mouth. This is pleasant surprise from the restrained nose – a more substantial malt in the mouth.

**Finish**: Medium long. Syrupy sweet to start, then turns a bit bitter on the final finish (likely from the wood influence, which grows over time). Caramel and a bit of eucalyptus carry though as well. A bit of astringency also comes up at the very end.

With water, the nose opens up more, with the peat and wood smoke rising a bit. Water also seems to enhance the sweetness on the finish, giving it better balance. On the whole, this is one where I think a little water is necessary to get the best overall effect. 

I know Smogen used Oloroso quarter casks for the first 1:1 release. The source is not stated for this 1:4 batch, but it strikes me as having more PX influence than Oloroso. There’s a lot of sherry sweetness here, and the underlying malt seems less peated than what when into the single cask expression I just reviewed. A bit less complex than the single cask expression above, but would make a good everyday sipper.

Grade 5, pretty much a rehash of Grade 4 from what I remember. Another bad teacher that couldn't teach it well enough to be memorable. 

Grade 6, A simple introduction to the Government and the way it works, why it works and how it was created. 

Grade 7, Canadian history of mostly colonizing Europeans and their interactions with the Aboriginal peoples. 

Grade 8, Renaissance, Aztecs and Edo Japan. The theme was ""Conflict of Worldviews"" but everyone was happy to finally get some new stuff that felt more like history containing conflict in general.

Grade 9, a more in depth look at government and criminal justice, as well as extremely basic economic concepts.

Look at Germany or Singapore for great examples of doing this. The issue is if we were to switch to these options, socialized medicine, or even a single-payer tomorrow, then we would still spend WAY more than we are now. We have such heavy control and regulation on the medical industry that some other countries don't have and you probably can't justify those changes to the American people. Two examples: Drop the requirement of education for a GP/Family Practitioner from 10 years to 4-5 years like every other country in the world. (it is usually only a B.S. degree in most countries. We also need to generally decrease the power the AMA has on certifications that most other countries don't have) Lower requirements on FDA regulations to get drugs passed. Our process for getting drugs passed is much longer and tedious than Europe. 

&gt;Since $13 appears to be enough to cover bills, $15 seems to be a good point above that.

I mean... in rural America $6/hr is enough to get the bills paid. I have friends in my hometown make little over federal minimum living well enough. How do you think a $15/hr min would effect most of the country? Yes, some large cities might be able to absorb it (probably not actually, we still don't have conclusive evidence of this), but not the small towns. There are better ways to help with this such as increasing the amount the EITC provides. The EITC is proven to be a better help for decreasing poverty than just raising the minimum wage. Also, we could employ more smart minimum wage legislation with a large EITC

Funeral is the debut studio album by Canadian indie rock band Arcade Fire, released on September 14, 2004 in North America by Merge Records and on February 28, 2005 in Europe by Rough Trade Records. It was given its title because several band members had recently lost members of their families: Régine Chassagne's grandmother died in June 2003, Win and William Butler's grandfather (swing musician Alvino Rey) in February 2004, and Richard Reed Parry's aunt in April 2004.

Preliminary recordings for Funeral were made during the course of a week in August 2003 at the Hotel2Tango in Montreal, Quebec, and the recording was completed later that year all in an analogue recording format.

The album produced five singles.

Je n'ai eu que deux defaite lors de réparation de refuge lancé sans construction et je précise que je joue toujours en recherche de groupe. cela pointe une des chose qui m'attriste le plus dans ce jeu et qui est la facilité avec laquelle on réussis une mission.

Pour repondre a ta problematique autours des manuels qui ne peuvent être farmé je pense et j'espère que cela pourras etre farm zone 4 grâce a un systeme de loot de shéma et il n'y a pour le moment aucun moyen de le verifié , je suis donc patient et je decraft les shéma dont je n'ai pas besoin pour evoluer mes arme et piege . même si il n'ont pas les meilleur affixe du monde ils restes très puissant face au monstre

Cela permet aussi de prendre plus de temps pour dropp des legendaire et donc de limité le coté rng en plus des quete qui se synchronise plus ou moin avec la rareté des pallier.

J'aimerai appuyé mes dire en me basant sur borderland et diablo dont fortnite est souvent comparé avec le fait que meme si les objet epic / legendaire reste accessible dès le premier niveau ,  ils sont extremement rare et ne devienne banal que apres avoir fini la progression d'xp et avoir farmé plusieure heure , alors qu'on trouve des personne avec 10 de puissance et un hero mythique avec des arme legendaire a fontainebois ce qui ne fait aucun sens et lorsque toute l'aide donné au debut pour evité une trop forte rng se termine on se retrouve avec des objet beaucoup trop puissant pour notre niveau et les objet que l ont reçois grace au differente quete et mission nous paraisse simplement inutile.

**YLAC-Nissan vs Yinhu-Toyota**

Both these Chinese car joint ventures started out producing derivatives of regular Japanese cars like the Nissan Pulsar or Toyota Corolla, but from around 2004, they were increasingly becoming a [way for the manufacturer to experiment with vehicle designs different from their own, yet with a familiar brand name, much the same way as DC Comics did with their Elseworlds' continuity - same characters, different world](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld).

YLAC-Nissan decided to use the platform of the [Nissan Almera N16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Almera#Second_generation_.28N16.3B_2000.E2.80.932006.29) [source cited] to create a stylish vehicle intended to be more sporting and fun to drive, unlike its Almera/Pulsar relative.

The vehicle YLAC-Nissan created was the YLAC-Nissan Liangxingzuo [""bright stars"" in Chinese], marketed as YLAC-Nissan LxZ in China, Taiwan, and in foreign markets it was sold as a spin-off of the Nissan Almera, under the names YLAC-Nissan Pulsar Liang xZ, YLAC-Nissan Sunny Liang xZ, YLAC-Nissan Leung xZ [Hong Kong] and Nissan YLAC-Nissan Almera LxZ Star [United Kingdom and Europe].

In styling terms, it lost the blob-like looks of the Almera, and gained a harder, edgier, more masculine look to it.

Bodystyles were a five-door hatchback, four-door sedan, and unlike the Almera it was based on, a five-door stationwagon and two-door pickup were offered as well.

Nissan's 1.5-liter/109hp 4-cylinder [QG15DE] was replaced for one of YLAC-Nissan's own design, a 1.6-litre/117bhp 4-cylinder that had variable-valve timing and was available with a 5-speed manual transmission. 

The 1.8-litre/115hp 4-cylinder [QG18DE] was also replaced, and YLAC-Nissan provided a new 1.8-litre/125bhp 4-cylinder which was naturally-aspirated at first, but from 2007 had a turbocharger installed.

What really differentiated it from the Almera was a 2.0-litre/194hp 4-cylinder turbo petrol, another YLAC-Nissan engine, that was designed to compete with the then-contemporary Volkswagen Golf GTI that had a 2.0-liter/197hp 4-cylinder turbo petrol.

This one was available as a plain turbo engine [in export markets], but you could also get a supercharged turbo model in the extremely rare GTS-R T2 model [T2 denoting twin-turbo]. This turbo engine was only ever offered on a hatchback or sedan, but buyer pressure to produce a stationwagon with the supercharger was quite high, and in 2009, the GTS-R T2 stationwagon was available, with only 15,000 available globally. Some people tried to get more out of the supercharger.

The YLAC-Nissan LxZ remains in production today, and is seen as a quirky but fun family car.

---

Yinhu-Toyota tried to compete, but went the other way, taking the design of the old [1987-1991 Corolla E90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Corolla_(E90)) and stretching the wheelbase, to produce a mini-luxury car with pseudo-1980s styling, but modernized engines.

The aim was a simple one for Yinhu-Toyota - create a quasi-premium car with a USP of affordability and tech-savviness.

From March 2002, the Corolla-based car [which had various names] went on sale from 1 March 2002, and was available only with high-end engines - no entry-level 1.4 or 1.6 petrols here, so you could only get Yinhu-Toyota's 1.8-litre/135hp 4-cylinder engine which was of Yinhu-Toyota's own engineering and design, and aside from variable-valve timing, shared nothing with the Toyota 1ZZ-FE engine that was also a 1.8 engine.

There was no performance model, but you had four luxury specs to choose from - Classic [Klassik in German-speaking nations] which was supposedly basic, but was in truth a lot more upmarket, followed by Style, which was as the name indicated, and slightly plusher [this was popular with women, and advertised by a big-name Sino-Japanese actress], and mid-range Elegance [which was more stylish, and had Mercedes-esque alloys]. Top-of-the-range was the Q, which was marketed as *Your individual Japanese sedan*, with the Q name not standing for anything in particular, implying ""question"". There was also a rare special edition, Arian [only 4,000 produced - launched in September 2004] which came only in silver paint [Welsh for silver is *arian*] and marketed by glamor model Ariana McKenzie wearing a silver dress [in print and television ads].

These vehicles were produced by YLAC-Nissan [YLAC owned 55%, Nissan had 45% in this Sino-Taiwanese joint venture] and Yinhu-Toyota [a joint venture which was 59% Yinhu Automotive Company-owned, 41% Toyota-owned, operating in China and Latin America].

Thing is, it's really hard to know if there are actual differences in their labels. Often popper manufacturers slap on different labels because it gives the ""illusion of choice"" to their customers...because in the end it's all about the sales.

Sometimes the only way to tell the difference is to just try the popper yourself. Obviously, that's expensive and anecdotal evidence (basing the formulation on experience, smell, taste, etc) isn't reliable and quite hard especially since poppers are used in conjunction with other drugs such as alcohol, weed, etc. It's also quite expensive and also benefits the manufacturer regardless (since the money is in their pockets).

CircleDog,,,"&gt; In 1860, the French and British looted the Summer Palace at the end of the Second Opium War and on October 18, 1860 the British burned down the nearby Old Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan). The destruction of the palace was ordered by Lord Elgin, the British High Commissioner to China, and was undertaken in response to the torture and killing of two British envoys, a journalist for The Times, and their escorts. The destruction of large parts of the Summer Palace still evokes strong emotions among some people in China.[2]

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Palace

To get an idea, consider this passage by Victor Hugo. 

&gt;Build a dream with marble, jade, bronze and porcelain, frame it with cedar wood, cover it with precious stones, drape it with silk, make it here a sanctuary, there a harem, elsewhere a citadel, put gods there, and monsters, varnish it, enamel it, gild it, paint it, have architects who are poets build the thousand and one dreams of the thousand and one nights, add gardens, basins, gushing water and foam, swans, ibis, peacocks, suppose in a word a sort of dazzling cavern of human fantasy with the face of a temple and palace, such was this building. The slow work of generations had been necessary to create it. This edifice, as enormous as a city, had been built by the centuries, for whom? For the peoples. For the work of time belongs to man. Artists, poets and philosophers knew the Summer Palace; Voltaire talks of it. People spoke of the Parthenon in Greece, the pyramids in Egypt, the Coliseum in Rome, Notre-Dame in Paris, the Summer Palace in the Orient. If people did not see it they imagined it. It was a kind of tremendous unknown masterpiece, glimpsed from the distance in a kind of twilight, like a silhouette of the civilization of Asia on the horizon of the civilization of Europe.

&gt;This wonder has disappeared.

That's not what I'm saying. But that ongoing projects aren't stopped was a requirement for many countries. For example Italy had an ongoing deal about selling military transport vehicles to Russia. They completed that deal under the sanctions. 

Without that grandfathering of existing deals there would have been no EU sanctions. 

&gt; Interesting. So at what point canceling them would be okay?

Stopping energy trade? Never. Basically everyone in the EU buys Russian gas. If the energy trade would have been part of the sanctions the EU would not have sanctioned Russia.

Was this meant to disprove my statement? I think it's a tragedy what happened to the Native Americans, and I wish things could have gone differently. This doesn't mean that British people aren't a legitimate ethnic group.
&gt; And I'm not. As I have stated earlier, the inclusion of a black character contradicts nothing in Tolkien's canon.

We might just have to agree to disagree here dude. I personally don't think that the vague suggestion that there might have been a few dark skinned poeple that could have perhaps migrated to Numenor and married a noble is enough of a justification to push identity politics into Tolkien. Google image searching ""european people history"" and getting nothing but black faces in the results is naturally going to rub people the wrong way and will only serve further cultural divides, and this character represents the same idea to me.
&gt;Myths change with the telling and with the people telling them - and quite frankly, nothing in the canon myths of Tolkien relies on skin color for the relevance of their teachings.

You may earn more money being an uber driver, but if you break both of your legs tomorrow uber won't pay for the hospital, and you don't have a pension to fall back on. Not to mention that many contractor positions and sharing economy businesses are putting more traditional and grounded industries out of work, replacing a larger number of more secure jobs with contractor-employees. Air bnb is great for average joe because it's cheaper and personalized, and because joe can turn around and rent out his apartment while he's gone.

Fracking may have been around for a long time but because gas prices reached historic highs under Obama American companies had the motivation and ability to put a lot of capital and make fracking very profitable. Not to mention the fact that there has been a ridiculously low interest rate since Obama took office, and only under trump has the interest rate been raised since 2008. Those low interest rates essentially put the aggregate economy on training wheels, letting businesses borrow lots of money ostensibly to hire people, but the reality has become that people's monies in the bank or anywhere but in stock has had almost no appreciation since 2008.

I respect that you seem well informed, but we have different opinions.

The second subject is the border itself. I mean the actual separation. That's under the jurisdiction of the EU, and it's a mess: In the event of a hard Brexit, it's a border between the common market and a third party country. That country, the UK will make its own legislation and  will likely have different rules on goods, labeling, food safety, etc... so the border can't be wide open. You can't let things in the common market that would violate the regulations in place. You can't have people importing american controversial chicken through the border for example.

And this is where the parallel with Norway crumbles, they are part of the EEA, and therefore the common market. A porous border with them is not an issue, they follow the same rules and regulations. Goods and people can travel freely, that's the whole point of the common market.

So this is why it's an actual issue, a porous border with a state that follows different rules will not do. Either an agreement is found, or a real border will have to exist in some form. Which sucks.

kamrouz,,Azərbaycan,"&gt;I actually asked one of the mods and other members on a thread about Armenia, why Armenia is being discussed here since it isn't European. No response?

/u/Idontknowmuch or /u/ThrowawayWarNotDolma maybe can elaborate or explain, although Armenia doesn't have any landmass located inside of Europe, it certainly does have associations and connotations to the European continent. Culturally speaking also, many would claim that Armenia is associated with Europe rather than the Middle East, I would assume Christianity to be one of the big unifying factors which links Armenia to Europe. I've seen quite a few of them also say the same about Azerbaijan on that subreddit, though Azerbaijan is Muslim. 

My personal rant and disagreement is, and maybe Armenians have slightly more of a case than Azerbaijanis, but as for Azerbaijanis, our entire history almost has resided within the Middle East (as people of Persia or Iran) with the exception of Russian intervention... I also think Armenian history has also remained within the confines of Middle Eastern history as well until Russian intervention during the Treaty of Turkmenchay (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Turkmenchay)?... If we're going to discuss that of  Roman, Greek, or whatever other European conquests that came to our region - they also came to places like Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, and others - do they have an argument that also makes them European, like perhaps Lebanon which at one point was a predominantly Christian nation with a large amount of European history due to European outside influence?...

Anyways, I certainly agree that Armenia and Azerbaijan's current geographical location isn't in the Middle East, but Europe might also be a stretch too. But if Europe is accepting of Armenia, even Azerbaijan, I don't see why people shouldn't or wouldn't want to be apart of it due to its success. I guess I don't blame those Armenians or Azerbaijanis at all. What we are though is certainly Caucasians, and perhaps geographers should finally specify and be more adamant about the definition of the Caucuses and be more distinguishing about the region.

Well much of it comes from Asians and sometimes Indians. A while ago it also came from European immigrants back when Europe actually worked properly. America is pretty large (courtesy of stealing other countries' land) so that's the resource part.

I think China out competes them because anything America (read: Asian Americans) creates, China can create better given they have even more Chinese scientists etc. China also sits on Eurasia which has more resources than the Americas.

&gt; June 1944\. Allied Forces stand on the brink\: a massive army is secretly assembled on the south coast of Britain, poised to re-take Nazi-occupied Europe. One man stands in their way\: Winston Churchill. Behind the iconic figure and rousing speeches\: a man who has faced political ridicule, military failure and a speech impediment. An impulsive, sometimes bullying personality - fearful, obsessive and hurting. Fearful of repeating, on his disastrous command, the mass slaughter of 1915, when hundreds of thousands of young men were cut down on the beaches of Gallipoli. Obsessed with fulfilling historical greatness\: his destiny. Exhausted by years of war and plagued by depression, Churchill is a shadow of the hero who has resisted Hitler's Blitzkrieg. Should the D-Day landings fail, he is terrified he'll be remembered as an architect of carnage. Political opponents sharpen their knives. General Eisenhower and Field Marshal Montgomery are increasingly frustrated by Churchill's attempts to stop the invasion. King George VI must intervene. Only the support of Churchill's brilliant, yet exasperated wife Clementine can halt the Prime Minister's physical and mental collapse. The untold story of Britain's most celebrated leader, uncovering the true nature of Churchill's herculean war-time status and his vital relationship with ""Clemmie"" - his backbone and total confidant...the love that inspired him to greatness.

it's Hillary who wants to improve upon ACA, Bernie wanted Medicare for all when we're experiencing significant pushback on the baby-step that is the ACA, you do realize that we barely managed to keep ACA by the measly count of 1 senator? and they are not stopping?

Hillary also wanted to slightly increase tax on the 1%, but Bernie wanted a huge chunk, also wanted to attack inheritance, the stock market, and he wasn't going to stop there. Hillary cared about where the poverty line is at, but Bernie was very concerned about how much wealthy people had.

Denmark and Norway have some of the highest taxes in the OECD while the US is in the bottom half percentile, to make our tax system emulate theirs would be, again, rapid radical change, and would be very unpopular

the error with Bernie supporters is that they keep wanting us to be identical to European countries without taking into account how fundamentally different the countries, histories, and populations are. did you ever notice that much of the altruism exhibited by European countries, specifically Scandinavian ones, is partly possible because of their homogeneous population? whereas in the US one of the prevailing mentalities as demonstrated by the Right is ""what's mine is mine"", in part because they do not want to help minorities, who they believe to be lazy and violent. they intentionally shape their districts to exclude minority areas so that they feel comfortable that what they pay in taxes benefits their white communities. this is why they are so opposed to the federal government subsidizing anything, they want to keep it local, white, and Christian. the federal government is their enemy, they forced them to end slavery, they forced them to desegregate, to legalize miscegenation.

this is partly why it's a fool's errand to want the US to be like Denmark and Norway. and do not be so quick to think of those countries as role models, look at how they are acting when they have to take in brown refugees. look at Brexit. humans are tribalistic creatures through and through. ethnic nepotism is real",True,False,,0,1501628975,,False,0,dl1agyf,False,t3_6qwek0,t1_dl15xig,1503684037,2,False,politics,t5_2cneq,

Before you start farming more gear, you should spend some time on Elementalist and Chronomancer, two of the most desired raid classes using Berserker gear:

LollipopScientist,9,Ibrahimovic,"I think Chelsea won the title last season because:

- They had no European football therefore less injuries and players being more fresh. (Main reason imo).

- City and Utd rebuilding.

- Surprising the league with the 3-4-3 formation. 

- Kante.

All pretty similar to how Leicester won the previous title when they:

- Destroyed teams on the counter with their formation. Probably only Arsenal figured out how to stop their methods. 

- Didn't have European football; freshness/less injuries etc.

- Had Kante.

Next season, I don't see Chelsea winning it. I do foresee them being 3rd/4th/or even 5th.

I disagree with you when you say Pep would've struggled with Utd. Reasons:

- Mourinho made 4 key signings that built the spine of the team. Pep would've done the same and probably would off load Rooney and the dead weight much quicker. This isn't to say Mourinho's choices were bad, I'm saying Pep's signings would've been equal to his.

- I feel Martial would've been a striker with no defensive responsibilities, enabling him to do what he does best. I feel Martial extremely dislikes doing defensive duties. Imagine dreaming of being a striker, becoming one then get forced to become a winger that is ordered to run back on the defence for fullback cover. Now imagine IF the same situation happened to a same aged Ibrahimovic, he'd be fucking pissed and would want to leave.

- Defensively we were already alright with what LVG left us. Pep's tactics would've made us worse at the back but I feel we would be better going forward.

All in all I think Pep would've gotten us higher in the Premier League (more goals+wins) but we wouldn't have won the Europa League because Mourinho is a superior tactician and knew how to push our players to the max.


Back to the main point about Jose's second season, I think Mourinho is very pissed that we didn't get Griezmann as he knew he would be THE guy to complete his vision. I still feel we're missing the creative attacker/2nd highest goal scorer of the team that carries games on their own (like Sanchez, Hazard, De Bruyne, Alli etc).

ritos_balancing_team,eu uol,,"Seeing a lot of comments about EU being a dying region and how this is gonna progressI think the problem isn't the fact that the region is dying I don't think it would if it got treated properly by riot - its more it seems like Riot are letting it die. There are 4 or 5 major issues in European LCS which are (relatively) easy to resolve, but there just seems to be total inaction from riot. For me, the main issues seem to be:

*** ***

**Broadcast time &amp; Viewer numbers**: It is very difficult for NA to watch EU stream because of work/school compared to how easy it is for EU to watch NA - this one is just a nature of geography unfortunately, although midday starts on weekends and the extra day every other week being the thursday not the sunday would help as more people are available at weekends.

**Exposure time**: Lets assume for a minute that the outgoing costs of an EULCS org are identical to that of an NALCS org (I know they aren't but still). EU teams are on air for 5 matches less every split than NA teams. That in itself is 25% less exposure time for European teams - this instantly makes a European team less attractive for an investor especially when combined with the lower viewer numbers.

**Riot's vision for the league**: The article seems to suggest that Riot have offered no development plan whatsoever for the future of EULCS whereas they have announced huge changes to NA which make it significantly more attractive to investors in terms of things such as stability (I don't agree with franchising but thats a different matter), exposure and even just a bit of clarity. Would you invest in a league when the league's parent company hasn't even said what they plan for the league in the upcoming years and every indication is that they're going to give an incredibly optimistic statement about region 'diversity' before not saying anything until another article comes up or it goes away?

glkjgfklgjdl,,,"&gt; estou a assumir que te interessa mais atacar o PCP do que defender os gays.

Estou apenas interessado em informar as pessoas LGBT (e não só) para que tomem atenção a quem o PCP defende. Nada mais que isso. Incomoda-te que diga algo tão inócuo como isto? Cada um interpreta as tomadas de posição do PCP como quiser.

&gt; é muito bonito dizer que o PCP é contra os gays por causa da questão da chechénia... mas depois esquecer o facto muito mais relevante de que o PCP votou favoravelmente ao casamento gay em portugal, ao contrário dos outros partidos de direita dos quais não se pode falar nesta thread. como explicas isso?

Eu não esqueci. Pela *terceira* vez, até te dei razão. Sem dúvida que, pelo menos no que diz respeito a legislação, o PCP parece estar mais do lado da população LGBT do que o PSD ou o CDS. Contente? Podemos passar à frente?

&gt; se o PCP é contra os gays, pq votou a favor do casamento gay?

Por favor indica a frase **exacta** em que eu disse que ""o PCP é contra os gays"" (ou algo *vagamente* semelhante a isso).

&gt; e se os partidos de direita são pelos direitos humanos dos chechenos, como explicas que tenham votado contra o casamento de gays em portugal? será que só são pelos direitos dos gays... no estrangeiro?

Idem. Diz-me **exactamente** onde é que eu sugeri algo que se assemelhe a isto? Esquece os partidos de direita... o tema aqui é outro.

&gt; lembra-te que esta thread é sobre um partido português (é interessante que praticamente só se abrem threads sobre este partido no r/portugal) e que não é possível compreender as ações de um partido isoladamente, sem as comparar com as dos outros partidos.

Certo. Diz-me lá que partidos com assento parlamentar é que defendem as acções actuais da Venezuela, assim como os regimes da Rússia e da Coreia do Norte? Ambos sabemos a resposta a isto: PCP.

&gt; lol porque não posso comparar o PCP aos outros partidos portugueses nesta questão da homossexualidade?

Deixei-te comparar... até te dei razão. Tu é que parece que não gostaste que eu comparasse a posição do PCP em relação à posição do resto do Parlamento, no que diz respeito à Russia, Venezuela e Coreia do Norte.

&gt; tipo, se te faz confusão o facto do PCP ter votado a favor mas os partidos de direita terem votado contra, não tenho culpa. por isso, concentra-te: não tenhas dois pesos e duas medidas.

A mim não me faz confusão nenhuma: aliás... é tão básico que aborrece-me estar a discutir o óbvio. A ti é que te parece fazer confusão que eu lembre às pessoas que o PCP defende vários regimes onde a vida e os direitos das pessoas (LGBT and otherwise) são o que são.

&gt; pah se tu o dizes é porque deve ser verdade... quem sou eu para refutar pensamento tão profundo?

Isto era suposto ser um argumento? Isto não é opinião minha... é obviamente verdade. É preciso estar a dormir para não se saber isto:

DownAndOut2010,,Openly gay saboteur,"&gt;I'd take issue with your interpretation of history there. England threatened to embargo anyone who called at Darien which contributed substantially to its failure and the ensuing economic crisis.

Oh I see, Scotland was *forced* to invest a massive amount of its money trying to colonise South America and establish an Empire, eh? The poor dears.

&gt;England then exploited this by bribing a relatively small number of high ranking Scots.

Most of English history was determined by a 'relatively small number of high ranking' men. Doesn't stop people apportioning responsibility to 'us'.

&gt;Scotland wasn't an ""architect"" of Empire: we were a lot more like a test case. Why do you think a vastly disproportionate number of Scots emigrated or went off administer various pestilential outposts of Empire or to be soldiers? Because we liked it? No: there was fuck all opportunity in Scotland thanks to the Union. Unless you're trying to argue things like the clearances, lack of investment, extraction of capital southwards and no bloody jobs as being ""not forced in any way"".

You're blaming the UK for Scots exploitation of Empire? And all that money that flowed through Glasgow and Edinburgh from the Slave Trade was simply *forced* on them, I'm sure. 

&gt;Unless you're trying to argue things like the clearances, lack of investment, extraction of capital southwards and no bloody jobs as being ""not forced in any way"".

Those issues were also present in England and were not specific to Scotland. 

&gt;Funny how you guys are always so shocked every time a country rejects the 'benefits' of your rule. I've come to the conclusion you actually believe your own white mans burden propaganda.

How have you inferred any of this from my post above? None of this matches my politics. Please take your assumptions elsewhere. Also that 'rule' also comes from Scotland, especially since Scots recently voted to remain within this oppressive colonial construct that is the UK.

&gt;What's more relevant is that Scotland hasn't returned a Conservative majority for nearly seventy years and we're getting damn fed up with Tory governments. Social democracy EU style is a lot closer to what a lot of Scots actually want.

That was my original point, yes. I live in Scotland and am aware that it has different politics to England.

&gt; * In the document, Bulgaria, already a NATO and EU member, pledged to support Macedonia's efforts to join both.

Ekaterina Paderina's connection with Mike Hancock was he had also been her constituent MP who'd she gone to ""persuade to help her"" when her visa was up after her first 3 month marriage broke up (they thought it was a marriage of convenience).

The randy goose of an MP had a proclivity for younger East European girls (there'd been a string of them) which had prompted MI5 to warn him that it could make him an intelligence target.  It was when it was revealed Ekaterina Zatuliveter had been connecting with other dignitaries, diplomats, and even NATO chiefs, that prompted an investigation.   The Daily Mail saw the name Ekaterina and thought what are the odds of there being two Ekaterinas in the same constituency with the same MP?  When they realised there were two Ekaterinas and Zatuliveter had been the MPs aide at the time they went with there being a spy connection on their front page and one had introduced the other.

Jooana,,,"&gt;Ireland was a neutral country. I suppose you're disgusted by Sweden and Switzerland too. 

Absolutely. And I have Swizz nationality. Anyone who thinks neutrality between Nazism and the forces of enlightenment is even remotely acceptable lacks any sort of moral decency. 

&gt; it was simply because they had to intervene due to a pact when hitler invaded Belgium.


Good lord. You know nothing. 

First, Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939 - when Belgium was still a neutral country. How ignorant can you be? Belgium stopped being neutral when it was invaded by the Germans in May 1940 - when Britain was already at war with Germany for months. 

Second, pacts are scraps of paper (this is actually an a propos reference). When the surrendering French told Churchill they were going to sign an armistice, the easy way out for the Brits would have been to do the same. The Germans seemed unbeatable. They had defeated France in 45 days - something that was completely unimaginable at the time - France was seen as the great martial power of that era; they had resisted the Germans 4 years a couple of decades before and suddenly fell apart in one month. The UK was standing alone against basically the entire Europe - any other country in the world out of the Commonwealth was either a Germany ally (Japan, Soviet Union, Italy, Hungary, etc) or neutral. And yet when the French told the UK they should come to terms to because it was a matter of time -the consensus at the time was ""if France fell, the English won't stand a chance"", Churchill's response was [*If it is thought best for France in her agony that her Army should capitulate, let there be no hesitation on our account, because whatever you may do we shall fight on forever and ever and ever*](http://fabpedigree.com/winston.htm).

In other words, if you think Britain fought the Nazis because of pacts (with countries that didn't even really exist as such any more), you're historically illiterate.

In fact, The American Revolution led to increased (government) tolerance of Catholicism in the UK as the government feared a similar uprising from Ireland and as a result the UK passed the Papists Act of 1778. 

Total tangent time: The Papists Act led to the Gordon Riots, which destroyed the reputation of John Wilkes, a radical politician who wanted democracy but led troops in quelling the riots, and whose name would later be given to the famous American assassin John Wilkes Booth.

WikiTextBot,,,"**NATO phonetic alphabet**

The International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, commonly known as the ICAO phonetic alphabet, sometimes called the NATO alphabet or spelling alphabet and the ITU radiotelephonic or phonetic alphabet, is the most widely used radiotelephonic spelling alphabet. Although often called ""phonetic alphabets"", spelling alphabets are not associated with phonetic transcription systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet. Instead, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) alphabet assigned codewords acrophonically to the letters of the English alphabet, so that critical combinations of letters and numbers can be pronounced and understood by those who exchange voice messages by radio or telephone regardless of language barriers or the quality of the communication channel.

The 26 code words in the NATO phonetic alphabet are assigned to the 26 letters of the English alphabet in alphabetical order as follows: Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel, India, Juliett, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, X-ray, Yankee, Zulu.

***

**Americanist phonetic notation**

Americanist phonetic notation, also known as the North American Phonetic Alphabet or NAPA, is a system of phonetic notation originally developed by European and American anthropologists and language scientists (students of Neogrammarians) for the phonetic and phonemic transcription of indigenous languages of the Americas and for languages of Europe. It is still commonly used by linguists working on, among others, Slavic, Uralic, Semitic languages and for the languages of the Caucasus and of India (however, Uralists commonly use a variant known as the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet). The term ""Americanist phonetic alphabet"" is misleading because it has always been widely used outside the Americas. For example, a version of it is the standard for the transcription of Arabic in articles published in the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, the journal of the German Oriental Society.

Azdahak,green,ᶰᵒʷ ᵉᵛᵉᶰ ˢᵐᵃᶫᶫᵉʳ⋅,"(part 2)  

&gt; At least the peasants of the old world could be self sufficient and rely on the land for survival.

Read more about how the feudal system worked. It sucked because it permanently locked you into peasanthood.  Most European peasants were serfs, which is something between an outright slave and a freeman tenant farmer.  Serfs were effectively tied to a piece of land which they could never own.  They were essentially indentured servants.   If the lord was cruel and imposed harsh taxes or rents, then they had to put up with it.  And the rent was due when the rent was due..even if the crops were poor that year.  

So if a peasant had three sons and only one could take the place of the father when he died what happened to the other two brothers? Parcels of land quickly got very scare.  It took the Black Death to kill off enough people to open up all that land and pave the way for the Enlightenment. 

Anyway, you may get your wish.  It looks like we're headed for a neo-feudalist society, with billionaires being the new aristocracy and ""basic income"" being the new parcel distributed by the lords.  And the rest of us eternal peasants forever in debt and indentured, paying rents because the cost of ownership has become astronomical. 

&gt; I understand you're a mathematician and not a naturalist, so I'll overlook the absurdity of your statement, for now.

Actually I have graduate degrees in both mathematics and biology.  We can talk about actual population models or dynamical systems in general if you like.  That page you linked (which seems aimed at kids) is talking at first about predator-prey systems, a very simple (and highly unrealistic) type of ecological model which can be described by a simple differential equation.  It's capable of producing something called a limit cycle which is an indefinite oscillation.  But any real system has some type of ""friction"" in it.  Nothing continues indefinitely -- a simple observation is that only a few of the species which were alive 1,000,000 years ago are alive today.   The simulator they talk about second sounds like an agent-based model which is capable of generating highly complex behavior....but they're difficult to analyze since they're discrete models.  Moreover the ""rules"" of the system are somewhat arbitrary.  

&gt; Yeah, until we are a global desert that resembles Mars or Venus. B-b-b-ut we can always find a new one.... r-r-r-ight??

Is your argument about protecting the planet, or about protecting the planet for human habitation?  Because those are two very *different* arguments.  

Like I said, in the first case, Earth doesn't need our help.  There's almost nothing we can do to wipe out life on the planet.  If we wipe ourselves out with global warming, the Earth will eventually adapt.  Forests will become deserts and deserts will become forests and new animals will evolve to cultivate new ecological niches.  That's the way evolution works.  That's why you can find fossil sea shells on mountain tops....the only ""equilibrium"" is on the short-scale. 

If your argument is about making sure we can survive the consequences of our exploitation of the planet, then I think there are much less pessimistic arguments to be made than ""well fuck it...let's murder and terrorize and scare the sheep all back into the Middle Ages..for their own good""  (Hmm..sounds like ISIS).

If your argument is simply about protecting trees and mountain gorillas and slime molds from human expansion, then you *don't* have much of a moral argument to make.  All for the simple reason that nature is *constantly* making some species extinct while at the same time creating new ones.  Mother Nature is as much murderer as mother.   While humans might be pretty widespread and destructive, we're no where close to a good old fashioned ice age, mega solar flare, or asteroid impact.

TougherLoki26,userflair,christian,"&gt;Without the Resurrection and other mythological claims, Jesus for the most part didn't exist.

That wasn't your original claim.  You've been saying all along that you don't believe Jesus existed, but when I can provide a source for the belief that he DID exist, you say that he just PRACTICALLY didn't exist.  You can't change on a dime like that.  It seemed clear to me that you were arguing that he NEVER existed rather than that he practically didn't exist.

&gt;Jesus left no writings so his impact historically is next to nothing compared to other veneered Romans and Greeks at the time.

Since when do we measure a person's impact on history by the writings they left behind?  Alexander the Great is remembered far more for his military achievements than for anything he wrote.  He had an enormous impact on history despite not having written anything.  I would feel comfortable saying that Jesus was perhaps one of the most influential figures in history.  After his death and resurrection, Christianity spread far and wide throughout the Roman Empire WITHOUT the use of force, all while being under threat of persecution for most of its first three hundred years or so. After that, it spread throughout Europe and the church gained tremendous power.  For over a thousand years Christianity has been the main religion of Europe, and has a several hundred year history in North America as well.  It played a part in the birth of modern science and has impacted billions of lives.  This movement that Jesus started (maybe not the right word but oh well) has become the largest religion on the planet (sources: http://www.worldstopmost.com/2017-2018-2019-2020/news/largest-religions-world-top-10-fastest-growing-list/      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations).  The second largest religion, Islam, has been spread through much of its history by force and war.  In fact, that's pretty much how it got off the ground I think.  Now, that's not to say that Christianity has never been spread by force.  I don't believe in spreading ANY religion by force, especially Christianity, because forced belief isn't real belief.  My point here is that Christianity got off the ground peacefully, without using force, while being under persecution.  Also, I'm not condoning the fact that the church got A LOT of power during the middle ages and basically did whatever they wanted and abused it.  I'm just pointing out the massive impact the church has had on history for better or for worse.

&gt;How many Christian denominations do you disagree with? What about popular preachers like Benny Hinn, Joel Olsteen, Paula White, Stacy Campbell, Ken Ham, Kenneth Copeland, Joyce Meyer, Mark Driscoll, LDS Rick Warren, James White, Paul Washer, John Piper, Pat Robertson, apollo quiboloy or the Roman Catholic Church?

I have differing opinions on multiple issues (such as the Eucharist and infant baptism) with a lot of other denominations, but the basic premise of most denominations is the same and that's what I agree with.  In regards to the popular preachers, I've only ever heard of Ken Ham and Rick Warren so I can't speak to the others.  I've never heard Ken Ham give a sermon, I've only seen him talk about creation, and I've only seen Rick Warren speak occasionally, but what I've heard from them, I agree with.

&gt;what if people during the time of Jesus were wrong?

About what?  Everything?  Just Jesus's existence?  You're going to have to be more specific.

&gt;your personal experience is moot in light of the constant drumbeat of Christian persecution of Jews thought out European history, this is historical fact.

What I'm trying to say is that the ""drumbeat of Christian persecution of Jews"" was the fault of the humans 100-200 years ago and not the religion.  I'm trying to show you the difference between the religion and the people practicing it.  Every religion goes through bad spots, some longer and some shorter.  Every religion has them but that's not the fault of the religion, it's the fault of the humans.

&gt;The holocaust was Christian persecution of Jews by Germans Christians back peddle all you want but there is no way to escape that fact.

Perhaps you're right, but as I said a moment ago, you must try to separate the religion from the actions is some cases.  This is one of those cases.  Remember who freed the Jews from the concentration camps.  It was British, Canadian, Australian, and American Christians (and Christians from other countries but it would take too long to list them all.)  Christians may have put Jews in camps, but Christians got them out.  The Christians who put them in there weren't following any Biblical command, whereas the ones who freed them were.  They were following the command to love others, even your enemies (whether they be historic or current).

&gt;Its called Postdiction a explanation after the fact.

Postdictation?  Isaiah calls Cyrus the Great by name.  He outlines what Cyrus will do before he is even born.  How can this be postdiction.

&gt;Do modern Jews use the Torah today to predict future events, no. 

I don't think you have the right to answer that because you're not a Jew and you've never read the books of prophecy.

&gt;I mentioned before there are many events that would have served the Jews better historically like the Holocaust that wasn't mentioned in the Torah. It would have far better to have a prophecy of killing Jesus considering the hardship of Jews under the Christian yoke.

You may be right, and I don't know why God didn't warn them about it, but we don't have the whole story.  It MAY be something similar to making a child get vaccinated.  The child doesn't understand and doesn't like it.  All they think about is the pain and they can't see the outcome because they don't have that knowledge.  This may be a really bad example and I'm just speculating off the top of my head here, but it's possible.

Jesus's death is actually prophesied about in the books of the prophets so that part of your argument is moot.

&gt;Crucifixion was common during this time so this ""Blood and Water"" would be a normal event after a Crucifixion, so what is the point?  Going into more detail of a Crucifixion does what? What does it add to the conversation?

I didn't really need to bring this topic up and I probably shouldn't have, but it's here now so I'll just run with it.  The point is that victims usually died without being stabbed or before stabbing was considered, thus there would be no flow of blood and water.  A Roman soldier who had attended several crucifixtions might be aware that this happened, but John the fisherman wouldn't unless he was there.  Sure, crucifixions were done in the open, but they weren't done in the middle of the city.  They were done outside the city so you'd have to go to some effort to watch one, let alone several.  You'd need to watch several in order to get the right circumstances for the victim to be stabbed and you'd have to be fairly close to see the water.  How many people do you know that would be willing to watch several people be nailed to a cross screaming and then hung up in the air for hours or days on end?

&gt;Why do you assume your religion, your denomination in light of so many other Christians and religions (Islam) is correct?  If you were not born under your faith and given a choice would you still be a Baptist Christian?

Someone has to be right and to be honest I probably believe that mine is correct because I was born into it.  I don't believe that there is a ""one true church"" though.  I believe that as long as you follow what the Bible says then you're good, no matter what you think of infant baptism, or the Eucharist.  BTW I keep using those two examples because they're the only ones I can think of right now.  As to your second question, I do have a choice.  I'm not being forced to stay a Christian.  I'm a Christian by choice, even though I was raised in a Christian home.  It's hard to say what I would believe if I wasn't raised Christian because that would involve changing a lot of things in my life, but I think there's a good chance I would be an evolutionist due to the evolutionary indoctrination children are given in schools these days.

Yet, The story group has said repeatedly that, its all one cohesive story and its all canon. Comics, Books, Movies are all on the same level as far as canon, unlike the old EU, where the movies were G canon, and books weren't on the same level. 

I'm just pointing out that the canon isn't cohesive, and Pablo has stated the details of the overall story doesn't matter.. which is what you said, the difference between mediums will alter the details.. 

Which is the opposite of cohesive. 

We can debate, how the wookies for free, then enslaved, then an entire book written with two major characters in it freeing the wookies, and then being enslaved again 20ish years later and how that is stupid and renders the book pointless.. why even spend the time freeing the wookiees? But I digress. 

I am unimpressed with the story group.. large portions of the new canon (not defending the EU it had its totally bad moments) and really Pablo... like I said to someone else..

ssl-3,,,"1.  Doug loves to stroke the names of the people who let him drive cool cars.  Nobody likes a schill.  We may allow exceptions, and this is an exceptional car.
2.  The wing isn't quirky.  It is merely a wing.  It is big.  And wingy.  Can we see past it from inside?  Who knows, Doug doesn't talk about the practical effects of the wing, preferring instead to discuss the orientation of the model number vs. the passenger side of the street.
3.  The headlights' asshole-flashers are not a feature, but extra weight.  The pop-ups were included because they were *cool*, not because they were necessary in any way.  It is disheartening to me that motors and electronics were wasted on this effort for such an efficient car, but Doug praises it because he can flash his high-beams without unseemingly raising the headlamps.
4.  There are eight locks outside.  And no internal cable or motor-driven releases.  Simple, efficient, light, secure.
5.  Lexan *is* plastic.  It's fucking polycarbonate.  We make CDs and DVDs out of polycarbonate, ie, plastic.
6.  Doug is amused that the vent-shaped opening behind the side glass is in fact a vent.  ""Who knew,"" indeed.
7.  Thin paint.  Classic car experts compare paint to paint, they do not look for texture.  If some of the parts show texture, then the rest of the car's carbon parts should also show texture -- left vs right, front vs back.  The F40 is not unique in this way of standard comparison.
8.  Doug is weak and cannot lift a carbon fiber engine bonnet without groaning.
9.  Doug is feeble and cannot hold up the carbon fiber engine bonnet with one arm while extending the prop arm with the other.
10.  Doug cannot operate a Monster Import cap with one hand.  Doug is a disappointment to women everywhere.
11.  Doug is amused that the F40 is not the same as a normal car, and that the bodywork comes in large chunks that open easily (except for Doug).
12.  Those aren't teeth.  Those are guide pins.  Get over it Doug, you're going to drive this thing on the street.  It's not made of eggshells.
13.  The main thing preventing the engine bonnet from being opened over the roof is the height of the person(s) doing the opening, not lack of restraint from opening too far.  Doug is not tall enough to accidentally open it this far, nor are most humans of this Earth.
14.  Being able to open the engine bonnet to such an extreme is useful for maintenance, but Doug does not understand maintenance.
15.  Oh, look.  You can see suspension bits with the front bonnet open.  This amuses Doug.  (I suspect that Doug is also amused by the Corvette and the Z3 and many other cars.)
16.  It comes with tools.  It comes with a manual.  It comes with a tire kit, but we do not discuss tire kits in this video.
17.  Someone made some excellent, well-constructed luggage that fit this car, and Ferarri made it available through their dealerships.  We do not have this luggage to display here, but Doug wants to show you an uncredited photo of someone else's luggage kit anyway.  (In other news, the E36 'Verts had both an optional hardtop and a color-matched trailer available as options...and I wouldn't be surprised if luggage was also an available line-item.  Nobody ever bought those things, either, much like the F40's available luggage set.)
18.  Doug complains about having no niceties or luxuries on the inside of the driver's door, while also noting the inclusion of both an unpadded arm rest and a window crank -- things that not all cars have.
19.  Doug thinks that the cable-release for opening the door from the inside is bizarre.  It is bizarre.  It's also simple, infallible, and light.
20.  Doug thinks that having only four forward gears -- in 1987 -- is unusual somehow, and then compares it to a 2017 Focus ST.  Poor Doug.
21.  Doug notes that the transmission has a different gear layout than many other transmissions, as if this is something unheard of in limited-production Italian awesome-cars.  He reiterates that making mistakes in this car, which he is about to drive, are things to be avoided -- because we somehow didn't know that already.
22.  Doug notes the barebones layout of the interior.  (I think Doug is either missing the point, or would stroke out examining the interior of an early Lotus.)
23.  Doug places extra emphasis on the F40's lack of an interior dome light.
24.  Doug proclaims that draining the battery overnight by accident is therefore not a problem in the F40, even though many regular cars have shut down accessories (see: GM's Retained Accessory Power) after about 15 minutes for over two decades and user-inflicted accidental dead batteries are often a thing of the past.  (What, no Focus ST comparison here, Doug?)
25.  It has sun visors.  One of them includes a mirror.  This is somehow quirky, and worthy of note -- we know this because Doug noted it.
26.  Italian car has extra stalks for headlamp and turn signal control.  (Ok, Doug.  That is actually kind of weird...sometimes.)
27.  Doug reiterates that the interior is not that of a modern Lexus.
28.  Doug notes that the center of the dashboard is not taken up by some manner of screen, as if infotainment systems were a thing thirty years ago in any car.
29.  Doug fails to note the extra hardware inside of the center console that apparently is the result of the thing called ""maintenance"" which he is unfamiliar with, even though those screws *used to do something*.
30.  Starter button is novel to Doug.  Who knew?
31.  Doug is amused that auditing a &gt;$1M, 30-year-old limited-edition Italian awesome-car to assure that it is all original -- whatever that takes, and document it all properly in a printed book (good, bad, and ugly), costs $7,440.  In other news, Doug is also surprised by modern Italian healthcare benefits.
32.  Doug laments, at some length (for Doug) the potential downsides of buying a used [anything].
33.  Doug talks some more about auditing Italian sports cars.  Doug is still surprised that people cost money.  (Doug demonstrates that he has never found a precious coin.)
34.  Doug continues to display his outrage toward the concept of people being paid for the work that they perform, before completely underappreciating the monetary expense of hunting down a counterfeit currency operation.
35.  Doug unilaterally disparages the American safety standards that the F40 was required to conform to, while acknowledging that the F40 before him is of European spec.  (Why do you waste our time, Doug?)
36.  Dynos and emissions tests lie, and always lie in favor of those writing the check.  Doug seems stymied by this.
37.  Oh, neat!  An actual quirk.  The Euro cars got fuel bladders, and the US cars got aluminum fuel tank(s).  Thanks, Doug!  (The uneducated safety lecture was a little  bit much, though, dude.  How do you know that the bladders are safer?  You're just Doug.)
38.  Time to drive the car?  Ffffuuu...  is it $1.2 or $1.3 million?

I'm completely amused that I hung out this long.  I may write something, like it or not, about the review's reported driving experience...but before I stopped watching all that I gleaned is that the interior feels ""like a monster truck.""

POD's: **84-56-14 (W-L-P) +39.81 units (10.1% ROI)** | *Streak:* **1 W** | *Form:* P-L-L-P-**W** | Extra POD’s: **26-16-3 (W-L-P) +7.87 units (21.9% ROI)**

In preparation for the new European seasons getting underway, I’m changing my strategy to narrow in on the top leagues only and lessen the risk of units on any single game.  I will be switching to a 1, 1.5, and 2 unit betting strategy only, but as FansUnite cannot track half units, I will double those for tracking purposes at 2, 3, and 4 units.  That is essentially the same thing but just know, I will personally be doing 1-2 units.  Less leagues to look at will lead to a more narrowed focus and less plays overall, so I will now start posting all plays via Twitter (which will be shown as 10*, 15* and 20*) and I will still continue to post my POTD here.  With that being said….

Today’s Pick:  **2 units** *UEFA Champions League:* Club Brugge KV @ Basaksehir **Over 2.5 Goals (1.87 / -115)**

Also note, I released this play on Twitter Monday morning when this line was available.  It is now at Over 3 @ 1.94 (-106).  Obviously the value is gone, but I still think it’s a safe play.  If the Over 2.5 hits, worse case is a push on Over 3.

Odd: 1.70 (Bet365)

APOEL have a lot of experience in this competition as well, and they’ll be fairly confident in their ability to get the win at home. Overall the two clubs are fairly evenly matched, so APOEL will be hoping their additional experience and home advantage is enough to tip them over the line.

Viitorul, quite understandably, have a very limited level of experience in Europe. The club was only founded in 2009 and has enjoyed a meteoric rise within Romania. They clinched their first top flight title last season, and subsequently qualified for the Champions League for the first time in their history.

bermudi86,,,"&gt; I think blaming the government on this is overly reductionist. As with most issues, the government is a reflection of the will of the people.

It is not reductionist, in fact is very disingenuous of you to call it reductionist. Fact: US government disregarded scientific information about cannabis in favor of using it as a political tool against undesirable citizens and immigrants. Asking for the US government to come out and accept this fact and its role in the global drug climate is just a logical step in ensuring the honesty of a government. Lies and responsibility avoidance erode the authority and trustworthiness of a government making it more difficult to govern.

&gt; There is a very large segment of the population that genuinely believes that there's a danger to the legalization movement.

Again, why is that? Did all these people investigate the subject and reached this conclusion? Or has the US government been promoting this ideology and pseudoscience for years to justify their policies? They should take responsibility for creating this climate of misinformation and conflict.

&gt;Literally everything has an element of that because there are opposing views on how our country should progress. Even things that are done for the right reasons are still used as political tools...

I am not debating that, I'm debating the lack of honesty about everything.

&gt; More than anything the part that really angers me about it are the people doing it with a profit motive.

They are the last ones that want honest conversation about the subject which is why you should be pushing for more honesty, not slow and deceiving change.

&gt; But anyway, the core point is that the government as a whole should not be a target for blame.

Why not if it was an institutionalized position? Please explain.

&gt; There are many people fighting the good fight on this. Many states which have pushed forward with legalization despite the risks. Many politicians (and private citizens) who have put their reputations on the line to allow progress. And it is unfair to that progress to paint with such a wide brush.

I don't understand this point at all. I don't see how the government being honest should take anything away from them and the work they have done.

The transmission and replication of this defeatist and apologetic attitude is what keeps us traped in this cycle of shit and deception. Its time to start telling it as it is. Lets start changing this shit.

The LaGuardia Committee was the first in-depth study into the effects of smoking marijuana in the United States. The reports systematically contradicted claims made by the U.S. Treasury Department that smoking marijuana results in insanity, deteriorates physical and mental health, assists in criminal behavior and juvenile delinquency, is physically addictive, and is a ""gateway"" drug to more dangerous drugs.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Guardia_Committee

The Shafer Commission, formally known as the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, was appointed by U.S. President Richard Nixon in the early 1970s. Its chairman was former Pennsylvania Governor Raymond P. Shafer. The commission issued a report on its findings in 1972 that called for the decriminalization of marijuana possession in the United States. The report was ignored by the White House, but is an important document against prohibition. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafer_Commission

UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs declared that cannabis had no medicinal value based on a report by Pablo Osvaldo Wolff that was unsubstantiated by any evidence, deliberately misinterpreted studies and which received no endorsement by the World Health Organisation (WHO). In 1949 Wolff wrote a pamphlet, with a preface by Anslinger, calling cannabis an “exterminating demon which is now attacking our country.” Amazingly Wolff's report remains the basis for UN's classification of cannabis up to today.

The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 is an international treaty to prohibit production and supply of specific (nominally narcotic) drugs and of drugs with similar effects except under licence for specific purposes, such as medical treatment and research. As noted below, its major effects included updating the Paris Convention of 13 July 1931 to include the vast number of synthetic opioids invented in the intervening thirty years and a mechanism for more easily including new ones. From 1931 to 1961, most of the families of synthetic opioids had been developed, including drugs related to methadone, pethidine, morphinans and dextromoramide; research on fentanyls and piritramide was also nearing fruition at that point.

The Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 is a United Nations treaty designed to control psychoactive drugs such as amphetamine-type stimulants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and psychedelics signed in Vienna, Austria on 21 February 1971. The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 could not ban the many newly discovered psychotropics,[1] since its scope was limited to drugs with cannabis, coca, and opium-like effects.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Psychotropic_Substances

The United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 is one of three major drug control treaties currently in force. It provides additional legal mechanisms for enforcing the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The Convention entered into force on November 11, 1990. As of June 2014, there were 189 Parties to the Convention.[2] These include 185 out of 193 United Nations member states (not Equatorial Guinea, Kiribati, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, or Tuvalu) and the Holy See, the European Union, the Cook Islands and Niue.[3]

When you suggest that:
&gt;considering history has shown it's a lot of bullshit.

What *exactly* are you referring to, specifically? There are multiple incidents throughout human history, where the widely believed ""truth"" was horse shit. Two examples would be the church of medieval Europe and, a more related example, when people believed that Lead could not kill you. 

Back in the day, lobbyists for General Motors attempted to shut down any scientific research that would suggest that lead in gasoline caused poisoning. This was a huge political and scientific hurdle. They tried to occupy the scientific community to deface the scientists that began to prove how dangerous lead based gasoline was. Finally, due to irrefutable evidence, it was proven that lead is indeed toxic and it became banned in most of its uses at the time. (Link below)

It is the sad fact that Politics often corrupts the people that practice science. Or more correctly, people with agendas/motives try to spread misinformation under the guise of scientific knowledge, in order to achieve their goal. You see this kind of shit constantly and especially in modern times. It's important to recognize that this sort of political meandering has nothing to do with the scientific method or science as a whole, but everything to do with greed and the flaws of the system and large interest groups.

The suggestion that scientific discovery, or the very IDEA of science is ""bullshit"" is such an unbelievably ironic thing to say that it is just staggering at how asinine it is. How can you use the internet, having a ""philosophical"" debate on reddit, and expect me to possibly take you seriously when you suggest that ""science is bullshit"".

...But in some people's mind Muslim and Arab are the same thing.  
Maybe even Muslim and African. And Christian and European and ""White"" are the same thing.

Only taking all of these equivalencies as a given, we can begin to envision a massive conspiracy.

After this, of course, we must assess that purity of the blood is a fundamental part of what makes Europe Europe.  
How else can we consider Europe ""destroyed"" and ""gone"" when it's full of people?  
So then we must think that the Muslim-African (same thing, in our mind), completely incapable of appreciating anything European, after 1, 2 or 3 generations spent on European soil, would dedicate his existence to destroying everything, because no matter his environment, their blood is impure, it reeks of their far away homeland, and it makes them incapable of appreciating anything of our continent without corrupting it.

As proof we can bring up Terrorism, the great weapon that Africislam uses against our civilized ""race"".  
Although 99% of Muslims aren't involved in violent acts, we can mention polls, that show their dislike for our values.

If the Muslimafricans dislike our values, then they can be considered part of the same culture that murders our children. We can even read the Qur'An and judge Muhammad by today's standards, to show that they all worship a monster.  
When moderate Muslims show up, we can say they're not ""true"" Muslims, or their transformation into warmongering barbarians isn't complete.

Then the Orban picture is complete.  
A conspiracy of Muslim-Africa, led by the dark powers of Europe.  
They come in and murder us, and we're kept in horrible chains, unable to react as we're slaughtered.  
If all Muslimafricans are enemies, then the mass migration becomes an invasion.  
If blood is part of our civilization, then a demographic shift becomes the destruction of all our civilization.

It is far away from what rational people are saying for a few points:

-European culture is in our white blood and goes away when that is ""tainted""

-All Arabs and Africans are Muslim, all Muslim are African and Arab, the issues of race and religion are one and the same

-Islam is INHERENTLY, IRREDEEMABLY, ONLY and ALWAYS hostile towards us. If it isn't, it isn't REAL Islam.

-Migrants are Muslims. Therefore they are hostile towards us. Therefore when they come en masse it is an AUTHENTIC INVASION.

Diet_Fanta,text,Omnom.io Owner and Writer,"So, I'm not really sure where you got your info on RU, or where you're going with it. I'll give you my two cents on it. 

There are several factors that make RU more successful then KR or NA/EU (AA in China is also very successful, but that's a whole different breed of AA over there). To sum those factors up, it's the fact that Mail.ru is a company with a very large capital (Revenue is $35B+ a year), and as such, they have a better deal with XL and overall have a better team managing the game; the market for MMORPGs is very different than the one in the West, with WoW not being as dominating; Russian players are much more accustomed to grinding than our players are; swiping is A LOT easier.

About that last part: you seem to be under the impression that Russia is not pay-to-win. Let me tell you: whoever told you that is full of bullshit. Russia is (With the exception of China, which we won't count) BY FAR the most pay-to-win version of Archeage out there. Why? Because selling gold is perfectly legal and even encouraged. Every single Russian AA YouTuber, AND I MEAN, EVERY SINGLE ONE, has ads for the first 15 seconds of his video where he advertises a site, such as fastrader.ru, where you can buy cheap gold. 

It goes something like this: 

&gt;fastrader.ru, market for gold in Archeage and other MMORPGs. Buy your gold right from the players, without any middlemen. Link is in the description.

And that's that! Neither Mail.ru nor any of the other companies that manage MMORPGs do anything about it. Why? Because that's just how games function in Russia, and people have long accepted that. It makes for a much healthier environment than in one where the company pretends to do something about gold sellers, and makes sure to tell everyone that it's illegal, even though the top players are still swiping. 

As to your point about the game being cheaper: Why do you think Patron is $3 a month there? Because the devs are super nice and want the players to have a nice team for not a high price? 

Nope. Because it's a different country with a currency in shambles where the GDP per capita is less than $9,000. That is the price point at which they can earn the most profits, as most players won't pay much more. It's the equilibrium point for them in terms of prices. Gold is also way cheaper on there because that's what players are willing to pay for them. In the US, GDP per capita is about $57,000, which means that on average, they can pay about 8 times the price that Russians would be willing to pay for a product.

That's my two very long cents on this subject. I could go more in-depth on it, but am kinda lazy, so that's that. LMK if you have any questions.",True,False,,0,1501642924,,False,0,dl1lljn,False,t3_6qlu9j,t1_dl17u8y,1503689535,2,False,archeage,t5_2sf59,

Even G2 doesn't do much aside from play really damn good. Fnatic has legacy fans and experimented with a TV show, H2k has a show, UoL just has a wonderful media presence.

I can give you a reason for at least like 9 of the LCS teams that they have fans, and most of it is shit that they go out of their way to do. Whether it be players streamer actively, owners really creating a ""face"" to the brand like EF and IMT, legacy teams like Dig and TL, and I can go on.

&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; Integran un consorcio con colegas europeos para estudiar un tipo de proteínas asociadas con el cáncer, y enfermedades neurodegenerativas y virales
&gt; 
&gt; Martes 01 de agosto de 2017 • **19:10**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Un consorcio de instituciones científicas de Argentina fue elegido por el programa de investigación básica más grande de la Unión Europea (UE) para estudiar, junto con colegas europeos y mediante métodos computacionales, cierto de tipo de proteínas que podrían estar involucradas en la génesis de numerosas enfermedades, incluyendo el cáncer, el Parkinson, el Alzheimer y las infecciones virales.
&gt; 
&gt; Grupos de bioinformáticos del Instituto Leloir, de la Universidad Nacional de Quilmes (UNQ) y de la Universidad Nacional de San Martín (UNSAM) recibirán casi un millón y medio de euros otorgados por la Comisión Europea a través del prestigioso Programa Marco de Innovación e Investigación Horizonte 2020 y la Acción Marie Sklodowska-Curie para la promoción de la ciencia. Ese monto se compartirá con colegas de la Universidad de Padua, en Italia; de la Universidad Eötvös Loránd, en Hungría; del University College de Dublin, en Irlanda; y del Laboratorio Europeo de Biología Molecular, conformado por centros de investigación de 18 países del continente.
&gt; 
&gt; Lucía Chemes, de la Unsam. Foto: Gentileza Institulo LeloirEstructura de una proteína ""intrínsecamente desordenada"". Foto: Gentileza Institulo LeloirLas proteínas que se van a investigar son las llamadas ""intrínsecamente desordenadas"" o IDP según sus siglas en inglés, ""un tipo de moléculas que despierta interés dentro de la comunidad científica porque hay evidencia creciente de que, entre otras cosas, se asocian con numerosas enfermedades"", indica la doctora Cristina Marino-Buslje, jefa del Laboratorio de Bioinformática Estructural en el Instituto Leloir e investigadora del Conicet en el Instituto de Investigaciones Bioquímicas de Buenos Aires (IIBBA, CONICET - Instituto Leloir).
&gt; 
&gt; Las proteínas, además de cumplir un rol estructural, aceleran reacciones químicas esenciales, regulan la expresión de la información genética, posibilitan la comunicación entre células y transportan nutrientes, entre otras funciones vitales para el organismo.
&gt; 
&gt; Dentro de esa categoría de moléculas, las IDP son un tipo particular que desafía el paradigma clásico establecido por el bioquímico estadounidense Christian Anfinsen, Nobel de Química 1972, una proteína posee una única estructura tridimensional que determina su función. En realidad, de acuerdo con estimaciones recientes, más del 30% de las proteínas son muy flexibles y tienen regiones plásticas que cambian constantemente de conformación y pueden interactuar de manera compleja y a veces ""promiscua"" con otras proteínas. Los mecanismos de esta versatilidad molecular son poco conocidos.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Antes se pensaba que las proteínas eran objetos rígidos como pelotas de fútbol. Hoy sabemos que debemos imaginarlas como moléculas a veces muy flexibles, cuyos movimientos son fundamentales para su función"", señala la doctora Lucía Chemes, jefa del Laboratorio de Biofísica de Proteínas y Motivos Lineales del Instituto de Investigaciones Biotecnológicas (IIB), que depende de la UNSAM e investigadora del CONICET.
&gt; 
&gt; El consorcio va a enfocar sus esfuerzos en avanzar en metodologías para identificar estas proteínas desordenadas en los genomas de las células humanas y también las de patógenos microbianos y virales. ""Estamos muy entusiasmados por esta posibilidad --dice Chemes--. La oportunidad que nos presenta el subsidio es única, ya que permite combinar y reunir las capacidades de múltiples expertos en disciplinas experimentales y bioinformáticas para avanzar en nuestra comprensión de la función de esta clase de proteínas. Y este conocimiento podría permitir en el futuro el desarrollo de terapias innovadoras contra muchas enfermedades"".
&gt; 
&gt; Asimismo Marino-Buslje afirmó que ""investigar este tipo de proteínas implica conocer una nueva biología. Y también permitirá eventualmente desarrollar mejores herramientas computacionales para su estudio"". (_Agencia CyTA-Leloir_)

&gt; Maradona. Pelé. Best. Northern Ireland's legendary star remains one of the most naturally gifted footballers there has ever been. Famously called the 'best player in the world' by Pelé, George Best galvanized Manchester United's five-year recovery from the tragedy of the Munich air crash. His skill and exuberance inspired them to win league titles and the European Cup, even though he was little more than a teenager. Tragically, his career in the upper echelons of sport was over before he turned 29, the result of his bruising battle with alcoholism and the crushing pressure of modern fame. (After all, this was Britain in the frenzy of Beatle-mania and 1960s youth culture, where Best was dubbed 'El Beatle' by the world's media.) Producer John Battsek (2016's Oscar-nominated Winter on Fire\: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom, The Imposter, Project Nim) and director Daniel Gordon re-team after their acclaimed, Emmy-nominated Hillsborough to deliver a heart-breaking portrait of one of the world's truly great sporting talents, whose extraordinary gift was decimated by his own addiction.

The 29th ID, a tactical realism unit, was established in 2005 by Captain Timothy C. Wilson. In this unit we use a modified American World War Two rank structure, but in-game we operate in a modern way with modern-day tactics. We strive to achieve our victory by using tactics as real and modern as the game currently allows. In the 29th Infantry Division, we are looking for dedicated, mature soldiers willing to put time and effort in advancing their skills with weapons, teamwork, and tactics. Not only for themselves, but also for the unit. We train and fight in both TvT and COOP scenarios with focus on squad and platoon tactics and communications, while at the same time **offering both NA and EU-friendly times.**

'China is everywhere' in Africa's rising technology industry

 Justina Crabtree

Friday, 28 Jul 2017 | 1:23 AM ET

It's a match made in business heaven: Chinese technology companies hungry for expansion are diving into the less-developed African continent, where several countries are targeting double-digit economic growth.

Iginio Gagliardone, a lecturer in media studies at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa, told CNBC via telephone that the Middle Kingdom's expansion into Africa has been particularly pronounced over the past four to five years.

""China is everywhere,"" Gagliardone said, though he noted that its presence was stronger in certain markets.

For example, Gagliardone explained that China was ""definitely the only player"" in Ethiopia, with Chinese investment in the country's technology sector totaling $3 billion as of 2012.

But, he added that China was making its presence felt not just in East Africa, but also as far north as Egypt and Morocco and as far south as South Africa.

According to analysts CNBC spoke to, success in Africa boiled down to cost, with Chinese companies offering cheaper alternatives to their U.S. and European competitors. Gagliardone also said that African companies welcome the Chinese ""no questions asked"" style of doing business.

The China-Africa tech story began two decades ago, with the expansion of Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE, followed by Huawei, which provides similar services.

Tim Steinecke, an analyst at management consultancy Xynteo, wrote to CNBC via e-mail that both multinationals helped lay Africa's telecommunications infrastructure, and also worked with local African companies, research institutions and governments.

Others pointed to the innovation Chinese companies have brought to Africa. In a report published in June, consulting firm McKinsey said that ""Nearly half of Chinese firms in Africa have introduced a new product or service to the local market, and more than one-third have introduced a new technology.""

Making a smartphone geared to African markets

Tecno, a smartphone maker under Hong Kong parent company Transsion Holdings, has embodied Chinese companies' winning formula on the continent.

Handsets from the Tecno, which has a regional base in Nigeria, have practical innovations geared toward African markets.

These included a long battery life as reliable power sources can be difficult to come by, screens resistant to dust particles and cameras specifically adapted for darker skin tones. On top of this local understanding is a market-friendly price: Handsets typically cost between $50-$100.

Tecno has grown fast, and according to Transsion Holdings' website, its collective brands in Africa have a more than 40 percent market share in Sub-Saharan Africa. Transsion Holdings has also seen a total sales volume of more than 246 million dual-SIM handsets, or phones which can hold two SIM cards.

According to CNBC Africa, Tecno itself has a 25 percent share of Africa's total smartphone market.

Attai Oguche, a Lagos-based deputy marketing manager for Tecno, told CNBC via telephone that Chinese companies are ""good at spotting trends.""

They ""adapt easily and come up with a product that everyone likes,"" he said.

Oguche added that the ""very conservative"" European approach means companies risk falling short of their Chinese competitors.



Chinese companies' influence on the continent has diversified from early forays and now includes broadcasting networks, data centers and smartphone sales.

McKinsey's report pointed to Chinese broadcaster StarTimes, which has employed a strategy of going in cheap and expanding later.

The company employs and trains locals while growing its viewership, and invests in both local and international programming. It has found particular success in Tanzania, the report said.

StarTimes' ""focus on the local market has taken television viewing from an occasional luxury to a daily routine for many Tanzanians,"" according to McKinsey, thereby capturing Africa's growing middle class.

China's formalized One Belt, One Road infrastructure projects were also spurring mainland interest in the continent.

In December 2016, China Telecom Global announced it would work with the Djibouti Data Center to expand its network and spur the growth of fiber cable services in East Africa.

Liu Changhai, managing director of China Telecom in Africa and the Middle East, said in a statement that the decision ""marks a new page for the company's regional strategic planning.""

Flyingdemon1,,,"Well, when one considers that she is essentially taking pot shots at socialism every other page, and that we have currently a significant number of people who support socialism, I would say that no, it in fact did not work, and no the agenda was not carried out with great success, at least not globally and long term (cough Venezuela cough Greece cough). In fact, I would say it was not effective long term in countries like the US and the UK either. Looking at you sanders and corbyn ( it should be noted that corbyn specifically is on record as praising communist and socialist countries (Cuba and Venezuela), including their DICTATORS, and both countries are shitty places to be. See: the large number of Cubans historically attempting to leave Cuba, and the large number of people who are now in poverty in Venezuela, in the middle of what could become, if it isn't already, a civil war.) 

   Also, I think your representation of rich capitalists and their viewing everyone else as looters in incorrect in both the real world and in the novel. In the novel: how did Dagny or Rearden ever treat their numerous workers that were underneath them as looters? They didn't. They respected them. They respected smaller businesses as long as they did not buy into propaganda. In fact I even believe that Reardon was not on terrible terms with a number of the people he ended up giving parts of his business to near the beginning of the book. For them the ""looters"" are the bureaucrats like dagny's brother or the Argentinian(I believe this was the one that took the copper mine, no? Honestly can't remember) government and those people who support them and believe that they are entitled to the success of others. They view the looters as those who think that they (dagny, rearden, etc) have no value, which at least in the case of the fictional world of the novel is untrue- they WERE necessary for the system to function.
   As for in the real world, i believe the same applies on the whole. Yes there are businessmen/women who don't value even the lives of the poor or their own workers, however this is not a common sentiment. Anecdotal evidence here, but please bear with me. My father is a businessman of a small company he runs with two partners (when I say small it's the partners, a secretary type guy, and last I checked one other person, though they are thinking of hiring another next year). Without going into specifics, there are three things about his job you should know for this example: 1. His job pays very well (though t did not always), putting us in upper middle class when combined with my mothers job. 2. He is taxed 50%+. 3. His job allows him to come into contact with many of the people who his tax dollars go to through my country's social programs. 
   He does view some of these people as grifters (looters is a bit strong for how he views them), while others he views as hard working people that simply are having trouble getting by and supporting their family. He does dislike that after working as hard as he has to get from an abusive family in an impoverished area to a family of his own solidly in the middle class he looses so much of his income. He does begrudge those people who he meets that are capable of having a job and don't have one, or who dropped out of high school and have since done nothing with their time, or those people who may be working a job but feel that they deserve what he got, yes he does dislike them for being given his money. On the other hand, those people he meets who are trying their best to get along in the world and are coming to him for help doing that, those people who appreciate the money they already get through social programs and don't think that they deserve more of what someone else earned without valid cause and reasoning, those people he respects and empathizes with. I suspect you will find that most people who earn a good bit of money and lose a substantial portion of it to taxes would be the same way, especially if you faced them with the people I described. Sure, they may feel that the poor people getting their money have made mistakes or choices or have done things that led to their situation, and may even think they do not necessarily deserve the money, but few educated and successful would truly think of all people who receive social assistance as ""looters."" (Now if corbyn got his way and the U.K. went full socialist then his supporters who were actually in favor of that WOULD be looters, as there would be literal appropriations of people's property.) They might not believe they should all be getting as much of that money, and for the purposes of an argument around say lowering taxes they might just argue in blanket terminology saying such, but it's not that they wouldn't help those people in actual need too. It's more the idea of a government forcibly taking that which they earned and giving it to anyone who qualifies they dislike. They have no choice in the matter. 

   And at a certain scale they can deal with that. 30% tax? Fine. 40% of my income? Well that's getting up there but alright, I suppose we do need a military and poor people do need to be fed. 50% of my income? Now hold on, we're getting a little high there mr government, I'm not sure I'm alright with you taking that much of my money to do with what you wish, especially not give it out to whomever you want without any say from me, ESPECIALLY when many of those people I feel don't deserve or need that which I earned.  

   Thing is, 50% isn't insane either, not compared to some of the higher rates I've seen. In certain states in the US for example I've heard that with state taxation added to federal it can get much higher, like 60+%. Not to mention if you move up a tax bracket (the US has a progressive taxation system, you likely knew this but I just wanted to be sure). Then in some European countries we can reach 70% at least.
   
   Point is: I disagree with you that all rich capitalists view all none-rich capitalists as looters and themselves as victims (and I disagree that they wouldn't  have some justification for the claim) and I disagree that there is no reason for people to be worried about the rise of socialism and Communism in the modern day and age. It is a reality, not a possibility.

The Protestant work ethic, the Calvinist work ethic or the Puritan work ethic is a concept in theology, sociology, economics and history which emphasizes that hard work, discipline and frugality are a result of a person's subscription to the values espoused by the Protestant faith, particularly Calvinism.

This contrasts with the focus upon religious attendance, confession, and ceremonial sacrament in the Roman Catholic tradition. A person does not need to be a religious Calvinist in order to follow the Protestant work ethic, as it is a part of certain cultures impacted by the Protestant Reformation.

The concept is often credited with helping to define the societies of Northern, Central and Western Europe such as in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland.

Seriously.  If you're in another EU country wanting to rent a movie on Amazon Prime through the UK site they'll stipulate that it must be a UK issued credit card.  And if you're watching on UK Prime outside the UK, save for a select few titles, you will need a proxy.

Makes no difference with buying goods on whatever card, on whatever site, but digital downloads and all sorts of red flags and restrictions get thrown up.  Likewise with downloads in Eurozone countries, even though they'll happily accept the same registered card for different goods.

You're working relatively ease free because the UK is one of the best at services and the likes of the UK and China understand each other's domestic regulation.

Asanjawa,,,"Beginning: World of Warcraft is all lore, as Warcraft as a whole has been around for 25 years. Here is the official new player guide https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/game/new-players-guide and an everything you need to know video by TheLazyPeon https://youtu.be/tb3lJcV9t_Q
The latest expansion is Legion, if you're planning on buying Legion, watch this overview https://youtu.be/nnjGw9ZL3QQ and go to the main Legion page here http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/legion/#home.
Pricing: the game is free until you hit level 20 with a character (current max level is 110), so you'll have time to find the class that you like to level with, my recommended first class is mage as you'll be able to conjure portals to capital cities and other important areas as you level up. You will get a one-time level 100 character boost when you purchase legion. The base game which includes all expansions except for the latest one is around €15, or lower with the discount that you will get when you reach level 20 on your trial account. The latest expansion (Which is now legion) is around €40. Once you bought the game, you'll need to pay for the subscription, which is can be seen here https://eu.battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-subscription. You'll get a full month of game time with the base game purchase.
Lore: People play world of Warcraft because the universe the biggest and best there is, There are over 20 novels/books written by award winning writers including Christie Golden and Richard A. Knaak. You can find them here https://wow.gamepedia.com/Novels. The channel Nobbel87 is the biggest lore channel on YouTube and he covers alot of stuff so I recommend checking him out. I do have a very 'small' playlist of my own for you to see just how much there is and I recommend trying to get through it and understand. http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoI_qcTkR3nyQ_zTVzb9vs6Eu6Pw9_nX_. There are also RP (Roleplay) servers present within the server list if your interests lie there. Tip: check out Goldshire :).
Playing: You can either start playing with a game standpoint, or a lore standpoint (or both in the end), My recommendations are playing warcraft 3 to have the best start you can get https://us.battle.net/shop/en/product/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos . You can also watch some videos by big world of Warcraft YouTubers like TheLazyPeon, Bellulargaming, Krucial, Nixxiom, Nobbel87, wowcrendor or HeelvsBabyface. But you can also just start playing the game for yourself and explore world. The game in its current state is focused on the endgame content which is always at max level. The game has raids, dungeons, pvp battlegrounds and pvp arena's in multiple forms. World pvp is a thing, because you know, it's alliance vs horde in the end. Dungeons and battlegrounds will be available to you at level 15.

That's because there was never a refugee crisis a decade ago. Most European countries are like 90% white. The US is 56% white. Europeans don't have nearly the same experience living around people who are a different ethnicity, and the refugee crisis was a total shock to them.

Pen and Wilders were largely a different phenomenon than Trump and Brexit. Trump had obviously been planning to run for years on a trade/nationalism message.

**Ford reviewing future operations in India, other nations**

Detroit (US): Ford Motor Co. chief executive Jim Hackett is reviewing the automaker’s operations in India and other markets, as well as Ford’s future product programmes, including plans to build a self-driving commercial vehicle in 2021, according to company officials and other sources familiar with that review.

Hackett, who took over as CEO in May, has told investors he is working on a 100-day review of Ford’s operations but has so far provided few details of the process, except to indicate that it is looking at the automakers’ luxury vehicle strategy, the future of its small vehicles and investments in emerging markets.

Ford chief financial officer Bob Shanks said that the review covers a range of issues, including Ford’s strategy for India.

“We have a lot of work to do (as) we address issues of how to fix India,” Shanks said. “Everything is on the table.”

General Motors Co. in May said it would stop selling cars in India but continue to produce vehicles there for export. Shanks said no decisions have been made and noted that Ford has a larger business in India than GM did. “We are very cognizant that will be the third-largest market in the world,” he said.

“Some big decisions will be made,” Shanks said, but he cautioned Ford may not disclose all those decisions at the end of the 100-day review.

Hackett is addressing challenges that have contributed to a nearly 8% decline in Ford’s share price this year.

The review of the Lincoln luxury brand includes whether current plans will meet former CEO Mark Fields’ ambitious targets for growth and revenue, people familiar with the process said.

Ford has set a target of putting a self-driving shuttle into commercial ride-sharing fleets by 2021. Hackett is reviewing the investment and timing for that project, the sources said.

Hackett also assessing whether to reduce and consolidate production of models such as the Fiesta subcompact and two mid-sized sedans that are built in multiple locations around the world, but are experiencing slowing demand.

One proposal would shift production of the next-generation Mondeo mid-sized sedan from Europe to Mexico, where it would share an assembly line with its sibling, the Ford Fusion, avoiding the cost of retooling two plants.

Shortly after he took charge, Hackett approved a proposal to shift production of the next-generation Focus for North America from Mexico to China, saving the company an estimated $500 million by consolidating two factories into one.

Hackett also is said to be questioning a plan to build at least half-a-dozen future models, including replacements for the Ford Mustang and Explorer and Lincoln Continental, on a new flexible platform that is designed to accommodate both front and rear wheel drive vehicles. Reuters

Aesyn,kemet,Kemet,"I know everyone's first assumption is that we play it wrong but believe me, we checked ourselves so many times because we thought the same too.

Most of the time I was the dracula but in the 4-5 times I weren't, I couldn't beat my friend either.

My strat mostly consist of building a minefield of encounters. If hunters try to utilize Mina Harker's power (2 hunters in the same place), there's at least one region which is safe from them so start there. Or you can be cheeky because you know you are OP, or you are trying to have some fun, and start really close to a hunter but predict where they'll be heading and don't go there(this strat leads to exciting games if they get newpaper reports at the beginning).

So you have 3-4 or more turns until they get to you. Thing is, in 4 turns probably only one hunter can get to you, so it doesn't matter. For an alone hunter to kill you or seriously damage you in combat, he needs to get extremely lucky even with the best items. If he slips up one time, dracula rolls over and kills him easily. With 2 hunters in combat, it is actually balanced, and combat can go either way. 3 hunters is your signal to get out, but never happens because...

ENCOUNTERS ARE OP. Unnatural Fog, Bats, Saboteur are rarely avoidable and waste so much hunter time. Especially Fog on a port totally drops a hunter out of the game. By the time he gets to act again, you'll be in the other side of the Europe. Try to place these where they'll be definitely passing. If you are suspecting them to stack up on a single city, put unnatural fog there and take the easy win.

Vampires are the next lines of defense. Similar to Dracula, these inflict serious damage on alone hunters, if not straight kill them. Since hunters can't afford to clear encounters together most of the time, these become very dangerous. You can then finish the hunters by picking your fights, if you ""delayed"" hunters with the delay cards, you can take several 1v1's. Don't be afraid to fight even in daylight in these circumstances, but most of the time you know where they are gonna check next, just park there (be careful of some hunter events though).

Desecrated Soil, Hoax are the finisher encounters, you mostly want these to mature. Especially Hoax, which gives you a Dracula Event (the most OP things lie here, some of the stuff are crazy like making hunter skip a day or playing yourself twice). These should be put in the very corners of the map. They shouldn't come across these first. So hunters should be forfeiting a turn to clear these, even though you can't get the effect, at least you make put them a turn or two behind.

Always have a way out, but don't bail out until you absolutely have to. Then you can go into sea, and pop out somewhere else. Desecrated Soil helps healing you here.

Power cards: Just want to mention, I won without using a single power card too (or sometimes even going into sea). But in the most games, we made a rule that Dracula can use Wolf Form and Misdirection only once because they are the biggest offenders (with Hide being next). Wolf Form should be saved for the direst situations like getting Consecrated Ground or something, but jumping out of sea with Wolf Form is really powerful because they cannot easily pick up your track afterwards. Misdirection could be used to visit a place again, but you should avoid doing that and use misdirection to clear lairs you know they are gonna soon visit to hide your trail. Hide can be used for making a mega ambush to really mess with a Hunter, but mostly used to confuse hunters. There are also some cheeky plays like hiding in cagliari while pretending you are in mainland Italy, which won me a game. Feed is straightforward, Dark Call is sometimes needed because you can get 5 vampires in your hand.

And lastly, Escape as Bat is your second Wolf Form. If you are getting surrounded, try to anticipate it before you actually do, and park in front of a single hunter. They'll be sweeping cities so they can't afford to go everywhere together. Be careful, if you park on the earlier players (Lord or Doc), later players can gang up on you when they find you. So try to isolate Mina Harker, on a city without railroads ideally. You want to Escape as Bat asap, but be careful of rifles and stuff. When you escape as bat, not only you are wasting their few last turns, you also get to move again in the night and it's really disheartening for hunters.

That's mostly it. Also for an advice, hunters generally can't afford to take risks or detours because they are working with so little time, so you can make risky plays with this in mind. Stay close to them, once you slip pass barely by them, you'll get so much time advantage that it's not funny. But always have a plan B in case it fails.",True,False,,0,1501653873,,False,0,dl1s84l,False,t3_6qx2eh,t1_dl16t2g,1503692806,1,False,boardgames,t5_2qmjp,

Currently we don't have a ""fix"" for our problems. What we do have are measures that *drastically* reduce our impact ... sadly the leader of the world chose to say *fuck you* to all those measures for 20-25 years, leading the entire planet to the point where we are today.

Anyway, the point is part of the US once used to be Mexico and thus the people inhabiting those areas before the US settled were Mexicans. This pre US Mexican population was granted the right to live in the US with treaties.  This is what contributed to the initial populations of Mexicans living in the US.

So they became known as Chicano. Generations of American born, but of the US land formerly known as Mexico.

Miramaxxxxxx,,,"&gt; I would have to go through the book again to give you a nice summary of how he defines it. It is a red line throughout the whole book. In the introduction, however, he writes this line: ""The culture produced by the tributaries of Judaeo-Christian culture, the Ancient Greeks and Romans, and the discoveries of the Enlightenment [...]"".

Thank you very much for your response. I find Murray's line of argument highly dubious. There are non-European countries that champion modern humanitarian values and there are European countries whose elected government currently work to undermine values like freedom of speech, in spite of our ""common cultural heritage"". To me, Murray's arguments rather seem to be a rhetoric move to justify some form of xenophobia, in the same spirit that xenophobes have argued over millennia: ""Look, we can never live harmoniously with these people in our society, because they are just too different from us."" It's so ironic that the argument stays the same, while 'these people' and 'us' constantly changes. For the longest time Jews were 'these people', nowadays people like Murray emphasize our common 'Judeo-Christian' roots, while at the same time claiming that Islam is way too different to fit in, even though the Old and New Testament are also considered divine revelations (albeit imperfect) in Islam. In 300 years Murray's spiritual successor might talk about the common ""Judeo-Christian-Islamic"" roots to explain why the Chinese can never fit in and most certainly the irony will be lost on him, too.

&gt; You're of course right that Europe has been war torn, but the same can be said about, say, the Middle East or East Asia. I have no problem forming an idea of Middle Eastern or East Asian culture, just as I have no problem doing the same for Europe. Much of it is downstream from religion. East Asian, Middle Eastern and European religions are obviously very different things. 

You might not have a problem in conceiving of 'East Asian Culture', but ask a nationalist Japanese and he will have no problem explaining to you how mistaken you are and how different the Japanese are from anybody else in the region. Ask an Indian nationalist and he might explain to you how they are the real aryans, while he will be shocked to learn that a German nationalist would easily conflate him with a Pakistani (to his utmost disgrace of course). These tribalistic dogmas are all ultimately ridiculous in my view and rather stem from an urge to differentiate ones' group from others than from any deep and tangible difference.

&gt; To give one example, he is very explicit in saying that valuing free speech is in fact better than valuing religious sensitivities, and that we shouldn't be afraid to say it. He argues that this stance is an important part of European tradition, and that people holding the opposite view is currently being imported in such large numbers that Europe is changing for the worse. He gives plenty of other examples, like views on gender equality, homosexuality, marriage etc.

Where I see Europe changing for the worse, especially with respect to freedom of speech, gender equality and views on homosexuality, is predomantly in those countries which didn't take in any refugees. In a brilliant twist of logic, this is of course also the fault of the refugee, since those countries are only 'defending themselves from an invasion', so then the counsel becomes that we need to enact the policies of the extremist in order to prevent a takeover by the very same extremist. Count me unconvinced.

&gt; I don't see the need to do the same for the continent as a whole, and end up with a mix of everything and nothing. A sense of having a common project is important for all kinds of daily things. It would be a hard ask to tell someone in Germany to pay taxes to build roads in Bangladesh. Some kind of connection and outer border is necessary, be it the nation state or the EU.

Please consider that at one point the Prussian was lamenting a mixing with Bavarian culture, while painting dire pictures of all the cultural goods that will be lost. This thought will be completely alien to the vast majority of Germans today and I hold that this is an invaluable cultural achievement. Our culture is not constant, but constantly changing, so the idea of cultural preservation either has to fail spectacularly or will inevitably slide into fascism, since you will need to regulate in detail how people live their lives. The good news is, that in free societies we will all have a say in how our culture will develop, the bad news is that this also includes those who have different ideas from you and me. I would put forward though, that if there is so much value in our cultural norms then I am absolutely sure that these will prevail. Not untouched, of course, but maybe even improved. Of course this will be a constant struggle, but that's the price we pay for living in a free society.

In any case: Sorry, for the preachy tone. I do not want to stick views on you that you don't hold.

Razor12323,UNSA,USA? More like ,"&gt;It kinda does because it reflects the deaths on the German side too. 80% of the German army casualties happened on the Eastern front. It was by far the focal point of the whole war.

That doesn't account for the fact that 3 million Germans surrendered to the Western Front allies. Nor does it account for the Italians or Japanese.

&gt;It was fought on a bigger land territory than all other ww 2 theaters combined, and the intensity and brutality is pretty much unparalleled as well. That it, in media, has been pushed towards the side is kind of vulgar in a way.

Are we just going to ignore the Japanese invasion of China? That one was fucking huge as well, with just as many Chinese casualties as the Soviets had, the only thing that made it have less casualties overall was that the Japanese had less than the Germans did in the Eastern front.

Are we going to ignore that the largest naval war in history happened on the Pacific Front between the Allies (mainly the US) and the Japanese? I think many Europeans forget that the Japanese were actually a competitor with the Royal Navy for the best navy in the world at the time the war broke out, with the British, Dutch, and French losing every single naval battle they had against the Japanese. If you ever heard of the concept of the battleship being outdated and the carrier has taken it's place, that was because the Japanese proved it multiple times over and over again against the European powers who tried to take on their navy (at the time they had very few battleships and instead focused heavily on the carrier.)

Are we going to forget about all of the Pacific war battles and just call the Eastern front the most brutal? Sure, it was probably the most brutal, but I would say the Pacific theater was close. If you thought the Germans were fanatics you haven't seen enough of the Imperial Japan.

One of the very first thing American GIs met when they landed on Okinawa [were housewives charging them with spears](https://i.redd.it/c45bthp8qt1y.jpg), cases of school children being strapped with mines and then charging tanks to take them out, kamikaze planes that would crash themselves at enemy ships during naval battles (at a rate of hundreds of planes per hour later in the war, so America actually had to calculate kamikaze attacks into their naval battle plans.) The Japanese even invented a giant human guided bomb that could be dropped from planes! Japanese would often commit to what are called banzai charges instead of retreating in the face of overwhelming firepower, which is where they would basically yell the Japanese words for ""long live the emperor"" and bayonet charge American GIs and Marines. This lead to cases like the battle of Guam, where out of 18,000 Japanese defenders, 1000 of them surrendered and the rest died, there were no injured on the Japanese side because they would often instead commit suicide before being taken prisoner. There's a lot more about Japanese brutality, but it either is questionable at best (Japanese soldier canabalising living Allied troops) or something that while tragic, was done on every front (mass rapes.)

In China the Japanese were a whole different beast, I don't know too much so I won't go into it a lot, but they used a lot of chemical weaponry, and developed a lot of biological disease bombs to use on the Chinese and other occupied areas (like Indochina, Indonesia, Philippians, etc.)

It's not like American soldiers were innocent in this side of the conflict either. American soldiers were known to, by the end of the war, kill any eldarly men, women of all ages, and children that they saw, just because they didn't want to take the chance. Japanese often fake surrendered, so later in the war when Japanese did actually surrender the Americans would generally just kill them anyway. The US military pumped the Marines and many GIs with speed in order to get them to match the suicidal bravery of the Japanese, something that was only seen in a 1 or 2 famous American divisions in the European front. American Marines were also infamous for sending the skulls or other body parts of Japanese they killed back to their girlfriends in America.

What I'm trying to explain with my rambling is that the pacific war was pretty brutal, and it would've gotten as bad, if not worse, than the Eastern front if the home island were actually invaded. The Japanese had kept all their best tanks and planes ready for the home island invasion, which was planned to happen with American and British troops because the Japanese wouldn't surrender after constant firebombing for months and months. Estimates of operation downfall (which would've been the largest naval invasion in history, 25% bigger than d-day, followed by an invasion of the home islands) casualties placed around 1-5 million alied soldier deaths, 5 million Japanese soldier deaths and around 10-20 million Japanese civilian deaths, not to mention the injuries or prisoners of war.

And I didn't even touch on the Japanese fighting the British in Burma.

TheNoobArser,Israel,Universal Nationalist,"You can read about the ideology in the Wikipedia page, but there are two problems with the likud today.   
  
First is the corruption that comes from being the leading party in the most part of the last 40 years. This is because unfortunately registering to a party and voting in the primary isn't really big in Israel and because when the interest group sense that a party is here to stay they all register to it and become a very large part of the voting base in the primaries.  
  
Second is the inclusion of fringe extremist groups, and some dumb people in the Likud that got to the knesset. One likud MK said 'the arabs (that we annex) can have all the rights, except voting' O_O  
Contrast that to what Menachem Begin, the founder of the Likud said:  
  
&gt;There are those who say we can't give equal rights to the Arabs because they don't have equal duties. That's a weird argument. It is correct that we haven't decided to require them to go to the army, unlike the Druze. But we have made that decision from our free will. And I think the moral argument is valid. If a war starts, we don't want that one Arab citizen will be in this hard human trial, in which our people were for generations, and in particular the First World War in Europe, of an armed encounter against one of his own people.

Allydarvel,,,"What they basically do, from my understanding, is create a profile of you from social media. From that, they can deduce what your priorities are. From there, they can serve you specialised ads, through social media that influence the way you think. So, for example during Brexit, if you were an immigrant that was unconcerned with immigration, but had shown an interest in science, they'd hit you with ads about how science could better outside the EU. If you had maybe shown an anti immigration bias, they'd serve you up loads of immigration scare stories that will turn a minor concern into a real scare. If you are very pro-EU, it may feed you ads that say, the games a bogey..remain will win easy, to try to dissuade you from voting at all. If you'd complained about the NHS at all on Facebook, it would serve you ads talking about how £350m a week could be better spent on the NHS. 


I've made that sound a bit binary, but it isn't, it is far more complex..it could serve you NHS and science stories, while skipping immigration completely, so if you relied solely on social media for news, you wouldn't even realise that the main Brexit campaign was based on immigration and sovereignty, you'd think that we were voting to leave the EU to lead the world in medicine and science. It is also real-time and adaptable, so if you receive lots of immigration scare ads, and start sharing them, it will slow these down and start on something else. Facebook filters what you see based on what your interests are, and who you interact with. So if you start sharing immigration stories, then Facebook automatically sees this and serves you up newspaper immigration stories, and shows you updates more often from anti-immigration friends who have liked your anti-immigration posts. So it helps create an anti-immigration bubble, while CA has already moved on to your other priorities. They can deduce automatically how you responded to the ad and then tailor the message further. If you ignore one ad, they can serve it up in a different way. If you like, comment, share or click, they can then refine the system further. 


Basically, they find out what buttons need to be pressed for each individual and then hammer them. It's all done automatically and intelligently. It creates an echo chamber to change or reinforce your already existing beliefs. Previously advertisers could filter groups of people..for example, go to Facebook and say, I'd like to target 25 - 30 year old, female professionals in the north east of England, predominantly Newcastle, who like beauty products..and send them ads. 


This is quite course, as if you are selling perfume, you hit a lot of people with no interest in that product and waste money. CA takes it from groups, right down to each individual. Rather than send out bulk ads, CA's way would only send that ad to people who were likely to not just like perfume, but to like that exact style of perfume, and then tailor the ad to appeal to them in a way that would most likely make them buy.

The European Single Market, Internal Market or Common Market is a single market which seeks to guarantee the free movement of goods, capital, services, and labour – the ""four freedoms"" – within the European Union (EU). The market encompasses the EU's 28 member states, and has been extended, with exceptions, to Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway through the Agreement on the European Economic Area and to Switzerland through bilateral treaties.

The market is intended to be conducive to increased competition, increased specialisation, larger economies of scale, allowing goods and factors of production to move to the area where they are most valued, thus improving the efficiency of the allocation of resources. It is also intended to drive economic integration whereby the once separate economies of the member states become integrated within a single EU-wide economy.

Comfy_Guy,,,"I appreciate your candor and thoughtfulness on your view of the current administration. To be quite frank with you, there is little for me to disagree with. You seem very well informed. I cast a vote for Trump--meaningless in this State--knowing full well that he would be a 'Chaos President'. I had a little bit of hope though, in the back of my mind, that the Office of the President would humble him and would temper his personality, but it looks like, well, at least 6 months into the job, it hasn't happened yet -- I don't if it ever will. So I can't really defend the man himself, or his cronies. It does indeed look like a plutocracy from the outside looking in, more than ever--I mean they're not even hiding it anymore. The thing though, for me is, as odious as Trump is himself, I found/find the Left, I mean, the Far-Left which has pretty much become the face of the whole movement, so increasingly odious and fascist itself, with their lack of respect for free speech (de-platforming speakers and allying itself with (Antifa), and just more broadly, having a complete break down in civil discourse, that I felt like I had no choice but to vote for and support Trump as a counter-balance to them. If this doesn't stop, then we're headed in a trajectory course for ""Gangs of New York"" style violence on the streets -- well, some would say it's already begun. The Left needed a slap in the face, and Trump was it. I offer no apology on supporting him for that reason.

As bad as things look now, I still have optimism for the future. America is an exceptional country and has survived periods of chaos before. The thing, however, that most decent and honest people should be able to admit here, is that the country was already in decline -- it was in decline with Obama and with Bush II before him. Trump was very right about the decline of American soft power on the world stage, to quote the man, ""America isn't respected anymore"". We are indeed participants in very lopsided trade deals that are currently hurting our country, and for that matter, others too (I'm thinking about Mexico). NAFTA gutted Mexico's economy by destroying much of their industry and agricultural sectors. It's no surprise that net immigration from Mexico to the U.S. exploded after the NAFTA deal -- you can totally see the casual relationship there. And Mexico, did take jobs from the U.S.. Very few, but those at the top profited from this agreement. For the same reasons that blue-collar Americans are hurting in the Rust Belt because of a trade imbalance with China, the same is happening with Mexico and our gutting of their economic lifeblood: agriculture, maize production in particular. 

To continue on the immigration issue. It's true, and I'm speaking as a fellow Mexican myself, that the U.S. more-or-less invited all the illegal immigration because of all the ill-thought out policies here--I believe this is what they call 'blowback'. The past can't be changed. But it doesn't help Mexico to remain in NAFTA. It doesn't help that we contribute to the instability in the Central American countries, have them in near economic collapse, our prolonging of the narco-drug wars, and then our crying foul when they send their children up here, to the border, basically asking for a meal ticket. When you have a massive welfare state, and an administration like Obama's, that was sending messages that could be misconstrued, e.g. DACA for Dreamers, then it becomes no surprise that thousands more come knocking our front door which is essentially wide open. A full border, does seem to be a waste of money--I agree with you there--but it is not racist to want to protect one's own country from illegal immigration. We either have sovereignty and control over our borders, or we don't; that's what being a country means. We should help Mexico and other Latin American countries, so they don't have to come here, but securing our border in the meantime, is a completely sensible and logical thing to do. Otherwise, we're going to be ending up like how Europe is right now with their refugee crisis.

It was an embarrassing move, politically, to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement. But if you look at the letter of the law, and see the various longitudinal studies, it didn't change a damn thing. The Earth will warm by 2 degrees by the year 2100 regardless of us pulling out. The cold hard reality is that the agreement was worthless; the U.S. was going to be penalized, while developing countries, including places like China and India ,where the lions's share of the pollution is taking place--or will take place soon enough, only have 'try' or do the 'bare minimum' since they're poorer, and we're not. Again, alluding to what I said earlier, this is an example of a lopsided deal. The U.S. has to lose millions in jobs and economic output, and others don't, simply because we're a richer country. I mean, that's fine, it would be a worthy sacrifice, but it looks like the data is already showing that the Earth will warm up regardless. So what's the point of bleeding our economy for nothing in return? Some sea level costal cities will become unhabitable, and everyone should be honest here, it will probably be no one's fault. The Earth warms up and cools down naturally. Humans, especially Americans, have very big egos, and we like to think we're responsible for everything that goes wrong, but we know from historical records, that the biosphere changes with or without our involvement. Maybe anthropogenic climate change is a fact, I don't know, I'm agnostic on that issue. But we will adapt, as we always have. 

Circling back to Trump and foreign policy. I cast a vote for him because I honestly thought he was the lesser of the two evils. Hilary, like Obama, was almost certainly going to be a Chamberlain. North Korea is on the news a lot right now, for good reason. Prior administrations have let their missile technology progress to a point now, that within two years, they'll be able to deliver a nuke to San Diego and most other cities in the U.S. I don't want to play a game of ""Chicken"" with North Korea. They're a regime with seriously bad intent, with concentration camps operating right now. You and I both live in San Diego, and know that Pacific Fleet docks here--we would very much be one of the first targets in a strike from NK. I don't want to die in a fireball of death because of some lunatic that doesn't want to relinquish control of power. Assad in Syria hasn't relinquished control of power, neither has Maduro in Venezuela, and so this is the nature of dictators. There are serious external threats to the homeland, Islamic immigration being chief among them too, and Trump seems to 'get it', unlike Hillary and Obama. I honestly feel confident that he will protect us, if and when the time comes to make a difficult decision. 

Trump will most likely not be impeached. The argument for collusion is impressive, but not conclusive, there are no smoking guns. And his own party won't turn on him just for the Russia scandal--it will start to fade outside of the news cycle by the end of this year. Sorry. You should wish the President good luck on steering us in the right direction, and not for an impeachment process. It's time to come together and face together the challenges that face the country: both abroad and domestically. Or again, we're in for a dark period ahead if we continue being this polarized. And Trump can easily win again, since you don't have to win the popular vote in this country to be President, as we know from '16 and '00. If you want him out, then get ready for the '20 election, get out some good progressive ideas out there, and reign in the bad elements of the Leftist side, and maybe I'll switch back to the Left. Until then, MAGA, folks. 

Well, like you said, internet fights/arguments really do turn ugly, often are protracted, and no meeting of the mind takes place at the end of the conclusion. You don't have to reply to me. I just implore you to empathize with the 'other side' so the division in this country heals. And tell others to do the same.

I don't see what is wrong with that particular quote.  Although it is notable that only pro-EU sources actually mention it as far as I can see.  Can they verify it word for word?

Democracy is a safety valve, it is there to protect against extremism.  A strong liberal, democratic culture takes the heat out of political decisions.  If Remain had won, that would be democracy. That said, we know that had Remain won, the EU would have taken that as a vote for much, much further political integration.  It was not a vote for the status quo.

As for most of those people you mention, I don't care about what murderous fanatics like Thomas Mair or neo-Nazi terrorist scum like National Action say, and I'm not massively keen on Jack Buckby or Liberty GB either (no-one knows who they are).
