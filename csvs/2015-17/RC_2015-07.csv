0,6,atenirp,t5_2qhmg,"I just enrolled in a 2-year Master's of Marketing program at a school in Europe, starting in September. I was debating for over a year if it was a good idea or not since most of the people in this sub from previous similar threads seem to think that it's unnecessary. I've lurked on this topic on /r/marketing for a while here's what i've gathered. 

Everyone will tell you experience is the most important thing in the field of marketing. Some people go as far as saying that if you have a master's you'll appear overqualified and it will actually hurt your chances of getting a job. Some people say that you don't even need a degree at all to get good marketing jobs. 

Many people say that pursuing a masters is only a good if you do it at a top school for networking purposes. I see where they're coming from, but I find it hard to believe that the benefits gained from networking would really pay off in the long run considering the tuition costs. Others say it's only good if you want to work at a big corporation as a manager of some sort, and if you're wanting to work at a small agency it's useless. I don't really want to work at a corporation but I could see myself doing it if the brand stood for something I believe in, so i guess it's good to have the degree.

Most people will tell you that it's best to get 2-3 years of work experience before going to MBA or Msc Marketing. I think they're absolutely right. I got my bachelors in psychology in 2010, I've been working in marketing for a couple years now. I would definitely not want to go into the master's program without the working experience that I have now. I plan to continue working at least part-time online for this company while I'm doing the masters so I can try to apply anything I'm learning in school to the business i'm working for. 

With all that said, my school is tuition free so it made it a lot easier for me to decide on going for the master's since it wont cost me a ton of money in the end and it's a good life experience. If I had to take out a fuck-ton of student loans I'd probably skip it altogether and wouldn't go back to school unless the employer paid for it. 

If you're not going to grad school you can still also just get various marketing qualifications online that will add a bit to your resume.

I'm 28 years old now and the way I look at it, If I don't go back to school by the time I'm 30, I never will. I'd hate to look back when I'm 40 and wish I would've just gotten the degree while I had the opportunity. 
 
I hope that helps.

0,8,ScooterinAB,t5_2qh2s,"d20 Star Wars is a burning dumpster of failure. With the gift of hindsight, the recurring opinion is that the game really never felt like Star Wars, but rather D&amp;D in space. It was also a mechanically clumsy mess.

Saga was a mechanical improvement, but it still didn't feel like Star Wars. It's worth noting that both d20 and Saga are a departure from the d20 system, so familiarity with that will do you little good.

WEG (to be fair you you want to look at all options) is well regarded, but you suffer from access issues and a plethora of supplements.

FFG is my favorite because it is both and enjoyable game that empowers the players and GM, and because it feels like I'm playing Star Wars. While the books are expensive, you never NEED anything but the rulebook. They do add other species, characters, and gear, as well as touch on storytelling and inclusions advise, but they are never mandatory for someone playing x, y, or z character. Bounty hunters and technicians are still just as playable as anyone else, despite not having their character book out.

Regarding your ""Lack of Sith"" comment, the way FFG set the game up is that you don't need separate rules to use the dark side of the Force. In fact, most powers have a dark side application. And while dark side does not equal Sith, the point is the same; you don't need specific Sith material.

Regarding ""Lack of the Empire/Episodes 1-3,"" there is no reason why you can't include this content; it's just that the game set its scope on the more popular and better known original movies. Funds not withstanding, you can make Imperial characters if you really wanted (again, you don't need separate careers to do this), and you can have Republic era Jedi and other characters just fine.

Before I respond to the rest of your post, let me just say it's pretty divine that I got called on the Jewish example. Immediately after posting, a little nagging voice called out to me: ""You probably shouldn't have used Jews; maybe Unitarians or Episcopalians or maybe even Mormons, whose whiteness is not in question."" [Verily, the chickens of my laziness have come home to roost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=208t80uceSg). Still, I'll try to answer all your questions to the best of my ability, and defend these poor, helpless Jews (opposite day engaged).

&gt;Are these people just one isle of intellectual brilliancy amongst a sea of less bright people, despite sharing huge amounts of genetical material with them?

From my understanding, yes. The Igbo/Ibo are genetically similar to their other Nigerian brethren, the Yoruba, and do not have a ""odd variant"" running through them.

Also, I should perhaps scale back the brilliance of the Igbo; they are noteworthy because they produce winners, whereas so much of Africa doesn't. However, that is not to imply they aren't bound by the same bell curve as the rest of us; there are many, many more regular and low-achieving Igbo than there are high achievers. They are just particularly noticeable due to their relative small population (~30 million), and some particularly noteworthy Igbo figureheads, like Chinua Achebe. 

To be blunt: they ain't exactly as accomplished as Jews, but for Africans, they're pretty darn good.


&gt;How does that work?

I wish I had more data on the particulars of the Igbo people; [even hbd chick is stumped on what exactly makes them so special in light of Chisala's article](https://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2015/06/29/the-igbo-the-japanese-shame-justice-and-inbreeding/). The slave trade, persecution by other ethnic groups, the wars with the Muslims; all could plausibly have caused selective pressures that could have led to Igbo exceptionalism (again, African standards). There is a particular push at the moment to find out if they are a kin-mating society, as this is traditionally thought to be a huge factor in the success of the Ashkenazim. 

So, to be honest: I don't yet know how they got to be that way.

&gt; In case of the Ashkenazi as far as I know their distinct composition must've been kept mainly within the group for centuries,

Yes. The famous [Cochran, Hardy, and Harpending study](http://harpending.humanevo.utah.edu/Documents/ashkiq.webpub.pdf) makes plainly clear the special selective pressures Jews faced. 

&gt;and they aren't part of the rest of European people's amongst which they lived, thus it makes sense that despite looking ""white-ish"" like you say they overperform.

Also, likely true. Of course, with secular Jewish outbreeding so high in Europe these days, it becomes harder and harder to maintain the ethnically Jewish/ethnically European distinction. But on a whole, their over-performance is most likely due to their kin-selective breeding for generations, in addition to their unique circumstances.

&gt; But like you said they only look white, and like you said skin color is a poor standard phenotypically and genetically for these assumptions.

Not necessarily a poor standard; just not the final word *sometimes*. 

&gt;This is where my question raises, are then these Igbo people like the Ashkenazi, in that they look black but aren't? You say they in fact are African, I assume you mean genetically speaking, therefore I don't think comparing them to Ashkenazi, who only look European, is fair.

It was, admittedly, a poor comparison on my part, especially in light of better selections. The general principle I was trying to demonstrate is that skin color, although *very* useful in the majority of cases (it is here my primary intellectual divorce from the left occurs), can belie a subgroup that does not abide by the generalities of its larger grouping; i.e. Jews who are considered average whites, Igbo that are considered average blacks. This is where leftist scholarship has some merit – one cannot always judge a book by its cover correctly, although one can certainly be forgiven for judging. Of course, leftists love to indefensibly expand that up to the notion that all of race is socially constructed, which I disagree with. 

A secondary point I was going for was that Jews and Igbo are the exceptions that prove the rules; their performance stands out against the backdrop of their skin color because their skin color is so often correlated with a certain style of performance. 

The tangential but important question, of course, is whether or not Jews are white, which is anything but novel in rightist discourse. [MacDonald would say no](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_B._MacDonald), most HBDers would probably say no, and I would say no, if by white we mean completely genetically similar to traditional white groups. While blanket-stating that Jews are genetically Semitic can often be assailable these days – especially for Jews who have lived in Europe for generations – there is little doubt in my mind that they are a separate ethnic group from the majority of whites. If we're conflating white to being tantamount with being European, then, no, Jews are not white genetically, although some certainly do try to pass as white and get away with it (if not for that damnable nasality). 

It should be noted that not thinking of Jews as white is quite controversial outside of our little bubble of thought-crime here, naturally.

So, yes, to your point, the fact that the Igbo are demonstrably African (until someone shows me otherwise), and the fact that a case could be made that Jews are demonstrably not European, makes what I said earlier a bit apples and oranges. Once more, I'm really wishing I had used a more defensible high-performance white demographic, like the Unitarians. I still think my original point stands, however: there are subgroups that perform differently than their macro-grouping, demonstrating terms such as white and black and brown and yellow are imperfect, though certainly not useless. Tim Wise is not a “white guy” like I am, but he could pass for one; similarly, Igbo-author Chinua Achebe is not a “black guy” like Robert Mugabe is, but they would probably be thought interchangeable in most polite society. Mine was a phenotypical argument that conflated two unequal genetic situations; *mea culpa*.

**TL;DR** *I agree with the OP; his assertion that skin color is not the only thing that matters, even in matters of “racism”, is demonstrably true. Sometimes even the left has a point about matters of race; of course, as with all things, they take it way beyond its zone of sanity. The Igbo are pretty high-performing for an African people, whether or not Chisala's paper, which did emphatically* **not** *demolish the whole of HBD thought, is 100% accurate.

I totally agree with this comment. The worse thing is that there are some people who are making a ridiculous attempt of helping Greece with a crowdfunding campaign and there are people donating(they already raised 270K Euros). These people dont have a clue of what they are doing. This is the same thing as giving more money to a friend of yours who didnt paid you back before but yet you are still lending him more money. Funny thing is that when it was a third world country such as Zimbabwe or Somalia to default a debt no one lifted a finger to aid them, I guess this is a perfect example of a manifestation of the hybris of the european and developed nations people; in which they only consider worth helping people who are from the so called developed nations. This crowfunding is a representation of the selfishness of people from the developed world.

People need to understand that as much as they want to help the Greek people to find a way out, by raising a Crowfunding campaign, this wont change the corrupt government Greece has. The Greek people are the one who placed themselves in this trap and now they are the ones that need to find a way out on their own we cant help them they need to find a way out on their own.

&gt;The __Holy Alliance__ ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): *Heilige Allianz*; [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language): Священный союз, *Svyashchennyy soyuz*; also called the __Grand Alliance__) was a coalition created by the [monarchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchism) [great powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power) of [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire), [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire) and [Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia). It was created after the ultimate defeat of [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon) at the behest of Tsar [Alexander I of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Russia) and signed in [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris) on 26 September 1815.  The intention of the alliance was to restrain republicanism and secularism in Europe in the wake of the devastating French Revolutionary Wars, and the alliance nominally succeeded in this up until the [Crimean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War) (1853–1856). [Otto von Bismarck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck) managed to reunite the Holy Alliance after the unification of Germany, but the alliance again faltered by the 1880s over Austrian and Russian conflicts of interest with regard to the dismemberment of the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire). By extension, the Alliance can be considered the most potent prevention against any other general wars on the continent of Europe between 1815 and 1914.

In the United States, some states pay more federal income tax than federal funds (like California), while other states receive more federal funds than they pay in income tax (like Alaska).  While on the surface this appears unfair, citizens are free to move from state to state if they feel the level of government services is disproportionate to the amount of paid income tax (similar to the Eurozone's right to freedom of movement).  Without rich states subsidizing poor states, Alaska would not be able to formulate a long-term economic plan (who in their right mind would want to live in Alaska instead of California if there is no financial incentive?) and its only industry would be strip mining its natural resources.

What's important to recognize is that certain nations in the EU benefit disproportionately from the union.  In particular, Germany's manufacturing industry benefits from the relatively weak Euro while its exports can outcompete local industries due to the absence of protective tariffs.  Meanwhile, Greece has no method of stimulating the competitiveness of its exports with monetary policy and its local industry must compete with German goods.

This commenter on TL sums it up nicely:

&gt;
While I applaud the appearance of CSGO content on TL, I learned nothing informative from this article. 

&gt;Reducing such a thing as culture into ""NA = free, EU = collective"" is a very poor and dangerous leap of logic. 

&gt;I'm sorry, but ""It's not a coincidence that North Americans are less adept at team games than players from South Korea, China and Sweden"" is just plain ludicrous. By that logic NA people should be poorer than Europeans at other team endeavors, such as basketball, ice hockey, American football, or Mid-20th Century War.

&gt;""the highly pro-capitalist sentiments of the nation that promote rivalry and competition have a major adverse effect. The idea of sacrificing oneself to achieve a greater good is lost on many, and more often than not, America churns out competitors who compete solely for themselves at the detriment of those around them."" Are you serious? Do you think Europe in 2015 is not capitalist? 

&gt;Please don't over-analyse in topics you are not qualified to comment on. Sometimes in the world, different sports/games take root in different ways, ways that are not easily explained by a highschooler's understanding of socio-econoimcs and cultural history.

&gt;FWIW, from where I sit there are two main reasons why NA teams suck: Lack of teamwork and lack of situational awareness, compared to the top EU teams. Please pull away from the weird and ill-informed cultural views and focus on specific, in-game examples of why NA teams have poorer tactics than EU teams. And then this would have been an informative exercise.

&gt;Remember, an article needs to come with evidence. And in this world, the evidence is in the gameplay. Start with a gameplay-first approach and find the answers there. If you say NA teams have bad awareness, show me the game. If you say EU teams never peek recklessly, show me the game. And so on and so forth.

While I consider myself a socialist, I am not so misguided to think that the USA is anywhere near a potential socialist revolution. I really think it never will be because of the extreme apathy of most of the citizens and more physical restrictions. 

Lets be real here. Bernie Sanders is no socialist. He does not advocate for workers control over the means of production. He also never seems to mention the lower class and is constantly refering to the classes as if he thinks we should have them. That the rich should actually exist, but just be more regulated. He is essentially a typical european social democrat. In europe he would be regarded as a normal politician with fluffy hair. The US is so far behind the rest of the world at this point, that we really do need him just to get caught up. 

Cons. I have a few besides the fact that he is not actually a socialist. He does not seem to have a very anti Israel stance which is something I would appreciate. However no one does, so we don't have a better alternative that still advocates for what Bernie advocates for (correct me if i'm wrong). He also said in an interview that he would continue very limited drone strikes which is something I am VERY against. 

Bottom line: He really isn't a dream candidate. I am much more radical than him. However we are talking about US politics. In that context, he is an extremely rare case. He is honest with what he says and actively challenges the 1%. We need that. Most of what he proposes makes all the sense in the world to me. Just not far enough.

So no, an exit wont help.

The biggest issue isn't so much what the trojka suggests. Sure Greece is in a poor state because it's cutting costs, but it still isn't cutting costs where the Trojka wants it to happen. It's also still not collecting taxes except from the poor which anyways have no money, surprisingly companies and the rich still manage to evade as always. Especially the latter is pure criminal, we aren't talking about loopholes here, they simply aren't paying taxes because the government fails to collect it. 

What goes on in Greece is a farce, for years and years plans are made by both sides and Greece still doesn't live up to those made agreements. To make it even better, they elect a new party which basically said ""fuck those agreements"", knowingly that it isn't an option but the Greeks voted for it anyways. And now we are half a year further, continuous stallments, no reasonable solutions from Greece and surprise they are about to collapse.

It's idiotic and these political impasse is what got Greece all the time in mess. They cheated when entering the EU, they cheated along while being in the EU and now in order to avoid paying they try to cheat again hoping for a huge haircut.

It isn't going to happen, what the Trojka wants costs only 3% of their GDP when they would actually would follow the set rules which were written by both sides. But again, it's easier to sit fence and hope for something good to happen, then to actually acknowledge as a government that you failed.",t1_cso8h32,t3_3bomts,0,,,,48,False,,1437479204,worldnews,False,False,0,1435715579,t1_cso3lio,cso8h32

I couldn’t work out why they wouldn’t let me do certain things and just like you were on top of me all the time.  It was suffocating.
I’m sorry to hear that no one said happy birthday to you, that is a bit sad but you also mentioned that your family were upset because you didn’t spend your birthday with them instead you spent it with your friends.  I can’t help but tell from this that they did want to celebrate with you at some point so it seems like maybe they were disappointed that you didn’t include them.

Can you tell me a bit more about your trip and why you had to cancel and I can see if I can help you that as I had a similar experience.  I got messed up with this group of friends who just used me.
And ye I know all about a controlling Nmom and Ndad but in the end they saved me from doing a lot of things I shouldn’t have been doing.  I got into drugs and stuff and I didn’t realize the effects of the drugs on my system.  When I was taking them I’d have this incredible high but then for days after that they messed with my mind and I was thinking the same way you are.  They would make me so paranoid and other stuff.  Anyway in the end I realized that they didn’t agree with my system.  Not sure if you are going through the same thing or not?  Can tell you more about this later if you like.  

I’m also from a European background and I know what you mean by guys being more respected than girls but sometimes it also might be an age factor.  Is your brother younger or older than you?
It also sounds like your parents are doing things for your sibling so why are they not doing it for you?  Is there a reason?  Why did he get a car?  Why did they pay for his holiday?  Have you asked him if they paid for it?

Sorry, but I would really like to help you and there’s a lot of questions.

Overall, I think you should stay at home while your still studying and try and work things out, I know it’s hard but sometimes it’s for the best.  If you are studying it will be really hard for you to get a fulltime job and keep up with living out of home.  Have you seriously thought about it?  I was stupid enough to leave home at one stage and I can’t tell you what I encounted out there in the streets of New York – scarred me for life.

- A cape was placed on the lower half of Tharja's body in the Summer Scramble DLC fanservice artwork, because it was too revealing.

- Any incestual relationships (like Lucina + Owain) were re-labeled as ""Companions"" instead of ""Husband and Wife.""

- Europe removed the mention of ""boingy bits"" between Tharja and Nowi's conversation in the Harvest Scramble DLC.

So there's a lot of worry that instead of a direct and faithful translation that we'll be getting a version that changes some aspects of the story.

Look at garment factories in India and Bangladesh. Foreign clothing and textiles companies employ thousands of local workers in these factories, which produce clothes for European and American markets. These production centers are providing workers with a livelihood–a regular income that may, for example, allow parents to send their kids to school. 

Without these factories, the people that currently work in them would most likely be destitute. They would not migrate to urban centres, and they would most likely be a part of South Asia's rural poor, like their parents. 

You've probably heard about how these factories have horrible working conditions. That's true. Workers are in the factory for absurdly long hours, and are paid paltry wages. The factories themselves are located in shoddy buildings, and there are issues pertaining to sexual harassment. 

The point is, even though globalization has allowed companies to take advantage of lax regulations and low wages, the poor are still better off (this is not a case for deregulation, I am merely saying they are better off with globalization than without it, nothing else). They are able to access new sources of labor demand.

&gt; I get that the history of the flag represents racism for *some* people, but lots of people I know don't associate it with that at all. Rather, they associate it with regional pride and a general sense of ""heritage.""

This implies that the *text* of the flag is open to many readings, outside of those ascribed by history and the experiences of marginalized groups. While certainly the flag likely *does* mean different things to different people, I think that it is a mistake to hold all of those readings in equal esteem. In essence, someone may perceive the flag without its racist baggage, but that person could simply be wrong. 

To use another example, somebody flying the swastika in Europe or the U.S. might claim that it is simply used to ""Honour the Dead"" or memorialize their ancestors who had no direct connection with the Holocaust.  Even if such a claim was made in all honesty, the social semiotics of the flag are such that it could not be flown without the public perceiving it in its correct, historical context and finding the action abhorrent. Such an action would be perceived as either reactionary on its face or as the result of willful, blind ignorance. This, of course, would be doubly true if those arguing for multiple readings of the swastika also subscribed to discredited conspiracy theories about the *true* reason behind WWII, which tend to come up in the context of the Confederate Flag and the American Civil War.

For another comment:

First Package -

From 2009 to 2012 Greece reduced the Government deficit from 15,8 to 9,3%.

In 2012 the most comprehensive reform packet was passed through parliament (barely), to save an ""additional 28 bn € over 5 years"". The detailed list of measures (translated):

[""The basic package
Specifically, the key points of the measures announced by the Finance Minister before leaving for the meeting of the Eurogroup, which will decide on the total amount of aid to Greece, are:

* The amount of 500 euro limited the 13th and another 500 Euros 14th salaries in the public sector: € 250 gift Easter gift 250 euro and 500 euro leave Christmas gift. These amounts will be given if the employee's gross earnings do not exceed 3,000 euros.

* Further cut benefits 8% bonuses of civil servants and 3% to employees of public enterprises where there are no benefits. Frozen (will not be granted increases) for three years in public wages.
Pensions (private and public) the amounts of the 13th-14th salary is 200 euro gift Easter gift 200 euros and 400 euros leave Christmas gift. These amounts will be given if the pension does not exceed 2,500 euros per month.

* Returns the LAFKA high pensions. Not affected by the 13th-14th salary in the private sector. 

* Coming changes in framework governing compensation and layoffs, as to reduce overtime costs.

* A special contribution to ""very profitable"" business. Rising VAT levels in 23%, 11% and 5.5% (10% increase to each step).

* Further increases of 10% in beverages, cigarettes, fuel due to increased excise duties. Increase in luxury taxes by 10%

* Open closed professions.

* Growing objective property values.

* Arbitrary taxation and finally conservation semi-open spaces 
Suspended the granting of the second tranche of the solidarity allowance

* Financial Stability Fund created."" ](http://news.in.gr/greece/article/?aid=1132263)

The government agreed to reduce the deficit below 3%, but failed to pass further measures that would bring the deficit down to below 9% deficit.

The measures, if you look at them individually are pretty ridiculous and only scratch the surface (cut 13./14. salary and pension payments !!)

Second package

The second package involved no ""austerity"", as the government was lacking the parliamentary majority to pass any legislation, only debt relief and restructuring was included, reducing Greek total debt and interest rates and stretching the term by 50 years.
""the new interim national union government led by Lucas Papademos submitted its plans for the for the 2012 budget, promising to cut its deficit from 9% of GDP 2011 to 5.4% in 2012, mostly due to the write-off of debt held by banks. Excluding interest payments, Greece even expects a primary surplus in 2012 of 1.1%.[189] The austerity measures have helped Greece bring down its primary deficit before interest payments, from €25bn (11% of GDP) in 2009 to €5bn (2.4% of GDP)""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis

The Third Package was never agreed.

The proof is in the pudding. Greece has not made the changes being talked about for years, like overhauling the taxation system (4 VAT rates depending on where you are, anyone can claim to be a farmer and not pay property tax). They haven't even tried. They have not overhauled the pension system. Everybody knows what to do. There was not a single proposal in Greek parliament, not even a failed one.

0,3,Kusaja,t5_2qh22,"&gt;Well, god in that she's a very powerful being. 

Ah, okay. 

&gt;Some crazy shit happened in R2, especially with regards to the destruction of the geass city or when Lelouch and the Emperor were fucking about in the World of C, and no one made any mention of these supernatural beings and they certainly didn't show up to interfere. My main bug is that it seems like Sunrise is making stuff up for the movies that were never planned to happen or be, stuff that wasn't part of and doesn't fit the universe as it was written during the first series or R2.

We are putting the cart before the horse, but I think that can be explained in multiple ways too.

Just because they didn't visibly act doesn't mean there is an inherent contradiction per se. Just a chronological gap in our knowledge. Is the World of C the only dimension or plane of existence? Probably not. Is what Charles tried to do as bad as what Shin is trying to accomplish? Not necessarily. Charles wanted both the dead and the living to exist as one entity on this planet. Shin seems far more insane and nihilistic. That might be more dangerous for reality than merely joining everyone together.

For that matter, you could argue from an in-universe perspective that these new characters didn't intervene because they saw how C.C., Lelouch and Suzaku stopped Charles and Marianne in time. Even their ""intervention"" here is rather indirect (asking Smilas to kill Shin) and more concerned with something that Shin in particular is trying to do. We still don't know enough to answer this question. 

And here's the thing: 

Neither R2 nor the first series were ever going to provide all the answers. The universe was not fully constructed and revealed. 

Lots of unresolved mysteries remained and in order to address them you need, one way or another, to introduce completely new pieces of information. 

The original creators, absolutely intentionally, left a lot of unexplored room for expansion of the setting. That is going to come in the form of new shows. Prequels, interquels, sequels. They already knew this and they are fine with the idea of future projects coming in to do exactly what Akito the Exiled is doing. 

As much as I like the show, I think the Code Geass universe, as presented in S1 and R2, lacked enough development in certain areas that I think Akito the Exiled can and should address. 

&gt;I don't think Akito fits in the original series, in terms of what it does to the universe. It feels like what it is: a plot shoehorned in between R1 and R2. I seriously doubt that concept of R2 put Lelouch in Euro-Brittania between the events of the first series and the second. If you've read Renya of the Darkness (where the hell did those bio-Knightmares go?), it's my opinion that these spinoffs Sunrise has been adding to the universe don't fit in context and weaken the universe as a whole.

On the contrary, I would personally put it this way: 

a) Renya of the Darkness mostly doesn't fit with the original series and doesn't necessarily add much that I find particularly interesting along the way. It's too unrelated and distinct. The manga feels like Bleach or Naruto with the focus on martial arts and superpowers with very little information about the state of the world (save some fights between Britannian royals, but those lacked context in my opinion).

Renya seemed strangely too shy about even attempting to connect with anything in particular from the original series. It felt like a story that could take place on another planet, aside from the faces of the characters.

b) Akito the Exiled mostly does fit with the original series. The new content it adds can be understood as an expansion of the universe, with more positives than negatives. 

Much of it can be reconciled with what we already know or, more importantly, included within the wide open gaps in our knowledge of many unexplained things in the Code Geass world.

For instance, I think the concept of Euro-Britannia is very interesting. Even if Akito doesn't exhaust the entire potential of the idea, it does provide a useful platform for future stories. Code Geass never did anything remotely interesting with Europe, so I like that the new story is happening there.",t1_csoc1vf,t3_3bm95o,0,,,,3,False,,1437481719,anime,False,1435723303,0,1435722613,t1_csoak4p,csoc1vf

After the Ottomans conquered Constantinople, there was a pressure on the Central European nations to form an empire or alliance of kingdoms, which could stop the Ottomans. The main European power of the 14/15th century, which tried to stop the Turks was Hungary. The Hungarian budget under King Matthias I was 1,000,000 golden forints, while the [Black Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Army_of_Hungary) and the upkeeping of the many border fortresses costed 800,000 golden forints in a year. That shows why a single European power of that time couldn't stop the Ottomans and that was the reason why King Matthias of Hungary conquered Austria and Silesia, while he mantained a peace with the Ottomans for many years; he tried to forge an empire strong enough to stop the Turks. After his death the Hungarian nobles elected a king from the Jagellonian dynasty, and again a new empire formed from Poland, Czechia and Hungary. After the [battle of Mohacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Moh%C3%A1cs), because of the agreements of the Habsburgs and Jagellonians, and because of the death of King Louis II, the Habsburgs, who only had Austria up until that point (emperor of the HRE was an empty title), inherited a big part of Central Europe and they created the empire which the previous dynasties tried to create.

Central Europe with the wealth of Burgundy and Spain with the Americas made the Habsburgs a leading European power, and as such they took part in every war in Europe.

After a time they started to call their new empire in the East: Austria, because that was their first domain there.

Brock's suplexes aren't as pretty as Benoit's; he does them very quickly, but carefully enough to avoid hurting himself (he almost always releases his grip mid-suplex; Benoit landed on his head a few times when he didn't, for example). Obviously, Brock blew the SSP when it mattered most, so he knows not to anything like that ever again.  He does plenty of double-leg takedowns into GnP (however, it actually looks like he either doesn't usually stiff the fuck out of the poor sod he's beating on when he does this or just stiff-punches people in areas that aren't their face, which is probably good for the other guy.  Mounted Lesnar GnP is a scary thing), does real nice clinch knees (he landed a few of these on Seth during the Rumble triple threat and Seth sold it like when Alistair Overeem killed Brock himself), will clinch up and punch from the pocket (the beginning of the Cena Summerslam match IIRC), and other, more 'real' moves.  All in all, the thing I'd want most from him is to bust out the arm-triangle choke he submitted Shane Carwin with back in UFC (if you've never seen it, the fight itself would be considered a classic in storytelling if it was in WWE instead; [watch it here](https://vimeo.com/92393703)).

Bryan knows enough BJJ to usually make his shit look real (most of the time; that one-armed guillotine he submitted Big Show with a while back is bullshit), and can do his flippy shit well enough when he pulls it out.

Cesaro can make you believe he is the Swiss fucking Superman, even if his opponent helps him with the moves.

25 free tabs to the first customer to post this on Reddit *** clearnet warning ***

We would like to respond to all the recent posts on Reddit accusing us of scamming. Firstly we have never scammed anyone and never will. We send all orders and we can say this with a clear conscience   
-----
We believe all the recent attacks on us is orchestrated by the LSD Avenger group. This is because we called The Majestic Garden out publicly due the unacceptable reading of our PM messages and the targeting of our customers while we were operating there. We also called out publicly that we believe the lab tests are faked. We are in no doubt we have effected their trading due to the influx of new customers and business growth we have received recently. We suspect this is their childish attempt at retaliation, the timing is around the minimum possible amount for plausible deniability.
------
We have NEVER threatened to dox any customer regardless of their attitude or behavior. We have NEVER put any type of pressure on any customer to post Reddit reviews before we sell them our product. We have many reviews due to the high volume of sales we make. We are accused of shilling on a regular basis, this is just not true. The one post accounts are mostly from customers who want to take the time out of their day to write the review. Some just do it for the free tabs no doubt as we do offer 5 free tabs to any customer that post an honest review
------
We have done nothing but good things for this community. We single handedly reduced the price of LSD on the DNM's by 60% since we started over a year ago. We shouldered the loss for most of our customers and sent many many orders we never got paid for when Evolution scammed everyone. We run a sale recently and gave away more free tabs in one week than most Avengers sell in a month.
-------
We were informed there was postal strike was in Germany and we assume this was the reason for some delays. It is very possible for UK mail to stop in Germany and other European countries before going on to further international destinations. When we searched on start page the words German postal strike, and the snippet a few results down the result page said  - Massive mail backlog after postal strikes end ..... 27 JUNE 2015..  the date 27th of June tallied up with the delays we were noticing. It was a mistake on our part to assume this was all part of the same strike. We would never knowingly tell a customer to Google something that we knew to be false. Although the German strike seems to be the reason for our delays as most order from then have shown up. Some German vendors even stopped vending while it was taking place
------
I see someone has posted all our bad feedback since we started trading on Agora, around 40 in total. We have almost 5000 sales on Agora. Do the maths and it is less than 1%. Factor in customers that try to scam us and I think we are running a good business by anyone's standards
-------

A message to the LSD Avengers reading this- nice try but your attempts to discredit me and make me look like a selective scammer etc will not work. I will tell you why - I sell excellent LSD at lower prices than you can - fact.  Thank you for making all the shill buys, we appreciate your custom

&gt;It is located on the [Cap-Vert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap-Vert) Peninsula on the [Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean) coast and is the westernmost city in the [Old World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World) and on the [African](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa) mainland. Its position, on the western edge of Africa, is an advantageous departure point for trans-Atlantic and European trade; this fact aided its growth into a major regional [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port).

&gt;According to December 31, 2005 official estimates, the city of Dakar proper has a population of 1,030,594, whereas the population of the Dakar metropolitan area is estimated at 2.45 million people.

0,2,purpletigerbot,t5_2vl2k,"&gt; Science was once the domain of a social class of leisurely aristocrats. They studied nature, because they had a lot of free time as a result of the wealth they inherited. They had a genuine authentic interest in the world around them and wished to marvel at its beauty. They seem to have a broad interest. Often these were men of a pantheistic persuasion, something now often interpreted as closeted-atheism, but in reality a product of their **love of nature**.

The importance of viewing nature with love. Reminded me of this paragraph from [here](http://sixpersimmons.blogspot.com/2015/02/science-and-magic-two-muses.html): 

&gt; As far as connecting with nature, I do believe that a magical or mystical mindset is necessary and probably also a default state of most children prior to civilized education. For example, it's not as though the native Hawaiians were on the verge of dying off from lack of knowing how to get food and medicine before Europeans visited them, this despite the fact that Hawaiian culture was pre-scientific and based on a magical religion in which various deities had to be appeased in order for certain things, like gathering potent medicine or food, could be achieved. Now, worshiping gods probably had little to no real world effect, thus it was unscientific, but it did encourage a certain kind of relationship with nature--that is, you had to ask for something before you take it, as though nature were full of other people who happened to be fruit trees and medicinal roots and fish. You don't just take stuff from other people because they'll get angry, so you ask. This tends to discourage things like clear-cutting and overfishing. From a scientific point of view, you don't have to ask anything that isn't human for anything you want. It might destroy a mountain to mine all its ore, but the mountain will never get mad at you, and the animals and plants won't ever take revenge. A scientific person knows better than to believe otherwise. This is why he can do such things. I like the inhibitory effect of magical thinking on such destructive activity. However, there's another point here. Those who study the natural world utilizing a scientific framework, even though they may genuinely love the natural world, are always distanced from it because of the subject-object relationship that underwrites any scientific enterprise. So for example, if I love my friends and want to understand them better, I don't tap all their phones and hack their emails and keep detailed dossiers on their activities, nor do I breed them or dissect them. I could learn a lot from doing so, but then they're not my friends, they're objects of study, and I miss out on an actual friendship with them. If I don't know better then I could easily mistake study for communion, but they are decidedly different things, at least to me. There are things about my friends that they will never reveal to me, and it's important that I don't attempt to find those things out. If I want something from them, I have to ask permission and reciprocate. I have to respect their autonomy in order for our friendship to be real--they're whole people, not things for me to dissect. Taking such an approach for a study of nature, however, would be decidedly unscientific. In this sense, science helps contribute to a psychopathic attitude toward nature. One definition of psychopathy is the belief that no one else is real and therefore does not qualify for the same considerations that the psychopath reserves for himself. The materialistic, non-mystical, science-based worldview also treats the natural world as basically uninhabited by any sentience worthy of consideration, so it's okay to stake your claim and milk it all dry. This kind of worldview could not exist prior to science because magical thinking was the only game in town. Science, of course, is critical for developing sophisticated technology, and the ability to manipulate the world at even the subatomic level certainly goes a long way toward reinforcing the subject-object relationship and consequent psychopathy. This is why I believe that a mystical orientation toward the world and an acceptance of the fundamental inscrutability of the natural world (hence magic) is necessary in order to live in connection to nature without utterly destroying her. It's also very lonely to not attribute a magical intelligence to the natural environment, which I feel is an under-appreciated source of mental illness in modern societies and leads to a need to ""fill the void"" with our own civilized likeness.",t1_csodrbf,t3_3bpgbt,0,,,,2,False,,1437482805,accountt1234,False,False,0,1435726206,t3_3bpgbt,csodrbf

The thing is, that we need a 	course correction; adjustments to the bail-out programme not only in Greece that focuses more on growth and employment rates and increase of social spending (many Greeks don't even have access to the health systems anymore - how is that something that anyone can want?).

My fear is that even if Syriza should be gone next week negotiations won't become easier. Thanks to Syriza and their retarded strategy the debtors and the rest of the EU will be even less considerate than they already before Syriza. In the end the EU voters decide how far the institutions can go, and they are pretty fed up with the Greek governemnts (unfortunately to a point where they have become blind for what the Greek people have to go through). 

And the Greek people might feel the same and think now that Syriza has gone full apeshit and all hope for a better bail-out programme is lost and that they could just as well follow Tsipras to wherever he is leading them. A small silver lining I see on the horizon: Maybe the insitutions are smart to be more considerate with a more moderate Greek government that might succeed Syriza soon. That would be a smart move.

It is always a constant 16 ping and is great, also to buy RP all you need to do is go to a nearby 7-11 (Taiwan has an abundant amount of 7-11s) Thats really it. 

Now for the cons. You think the NA/EU client is bad? you have no idea how bad the Garena client is. We still have the ancient match history that only shows you your own personal item-buys and ip/xp gains. This makes it impossible for people to analyze your own statistics and try to become a better player (so much for e-sports) ON TOP of that there is no API so there is no op.gg or lol king. So we don't even know our own MMR and our average KDA. This is really hurting the Taiwanese e-sport scene, and it is really sad to see them not do well because of our terrible servers, and support.

EU and NA might seem toxic but you have not seen the toxicity of Garena servers. The problem isn't really players being toxic, i can just mute them and not care about them, but its the problem of Garena are not punishing these toxic players. I was a very toxic player before lvl 30 (around lvl 20-25) I shouted, swore, and flamed at my team mates almost every game if they made any mistakes. People would report me and I would get a warning like in NA or EU; ""your recent behavior hasn't been in line.......make sure you're being more sportsmanlike"" I get that almost every single game, yet i was never banned or put into a lower priority queue. Im absolutely certain that Garena doesn't even look at reports. The only time I was banned was when i wen't AFK. NEVER was i banned for toxicity. Now that I have improved and stopped flaming at my teammates and raging. Whenever i see a toxic player i don't even bother about reporting them because i know there is no point. 

The Garena servers really just lack the attention than other servers, because of course more people play on NA and EU. The community is terrible and there isn't really an exact way for players to interact with the Garena employees like NA and EU does. Garena is quite a new company (their client is still in beta) and they have A LOT of room to improve and I really hope they are trying their best.

&gt; So the key to understanding the Euro crisis is the [Trilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trinity): a country must pick two out of a fixed exchange rate, free capital flow, and sovereign monetary policy. 

&gt; Now the EU is a monetary union. There is free capital flow within the EU. There is in theory free flow of labor. However, because of cultural differences it's not as flexible as, say, America's labor market. This is the argument of why we can look at the EU as separate countries with a fixed exchange rate of 1:1. So 1 Greek Euro = 1 German Euro. This means that Greece must choose a fixed exchange rate and is at the very least strongly encouraged to pick free capital flow. 

&gt; The other thing that is useful to understand the crisis is how exports and exchange rates interact. If a country is exporting a lot of good, then foreigners want to buy it's currency. Demand for the currency rises, and the currency becomes stronger. This in turn dampens the demand for the goods, as they are relatively more expensive. 

&gt; Post-unification Germany wasn't in the strongest economic situation. Their strategy was export-driven growth. By encouraging exports, if Germany was on the Deutsche Mark it would strengthen. There are ways to get around this drag on export-driven growth; e.g. China has been using monetary policy to lower their exchange rate (less so now). However, Germany has been burned by inflation really badly before and is hesitant to really pull out the stops on monetary policy. 

&gt; However, Germany is on the Euro. This means the impact of German exports is spread out across the Eurozone, and Germany's exchange rate is *weaker* than it would be on the Mark. Greece is less competitive for various reasons; notably Greece has issues with corruption. So Greece's exchange rate is *stronger* than it would be on the Drachma. This boosts German exports. In the US, this imbalance wouldn't be a huge problem; if the Bay Area is booming and the Midwest isn't, people move to where the jobs are. The EU doesn't have as flexible a labor market. So the imbalance stays.

&gt; Also, by being in the EU Greece can now borrow in Euros and cannot print it's way out of debt. Greece suddenly has very cheap debt and a strong currency that makes importing very cheap but exporting less profitable. It's still not very competitive. Also, the world is in the midst of various property bubbles. All of these add up to a situation where it is very tempting for the Greek government to borrow and spend. As it happens, lot of this money comes from German banks.

&gt; So finally you have a recession triggered by a financial crisis. The economy tanks, and all that debt becomes impossible to repay. Places like Iceland without the Euro can just print their way out. However, in the EU Germany's economy is still rather strong so they oppose printing more Euros. The alternative is internal devaluation. They can't make their debt smaller with inflation, and they can't boost exports by weakening their currency. They can boost exports / attract investment by pushing down their own wages; this is where austerity comes in. The problem is austerity is very costly as it's a negative fiscal shock piled on top of an existing recession; devaluation with monetary policy is relatively cheap (just raising future borrowing costs).

&gt; Ireland sort of pulled off internal devaluation, Greece was much further in the hole and faced much more political unrest. Germany refuses to bail out Greece without Greece imposing more internal devaluation. This is awkward, because the Germans are using rhetoric implying moral failure in Greece, while quietly protecting their interests (low inflation, weak Euro boosting their exports, protecting their bank's loans). A lot of Greeks really resent this, but Greece genuinely has a lot of structural issues that could do with reform (though a recession is probably a bad time). 

&gt; If Greece leaves it can devalue it's currency instead of committing to more austerity. However, it loses the other benefits of the EU and puts itself at risk of financial panic / speculative attacks. When Iceland devalued it's way out of trouble, it had to get a IMF bailout and put temporary capital controls to prevent this.

First, I'd like to address your point about pairing the different types of tanks.

We all know that the main clash between Warsaw Pact and NATO was supposed to happen in European Theatre. The elite Soviet force that was supposed to spearhead the advance was the formation called [The Group of Soviet Forces in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Soviet_Forces_in_Germany). By the end of the 80's GSFG was in the process of being reequpped with T-80 tanks (mainly T-80B\T-80BV) with some units still fielding T-64 (BVs?). 

GSFG was the only force outside of the Soviet Union to field T-80s and it had no T-72s in any notable numbers. So what I am trying to say here is that there was no pairing with attempt to use less technologically advanced T-62s\T-72s as a breakthrough cannon fodder. T-72s were supplied to the Soviet units stationed on less important fronts and sold for export (T-72M and T-72S families).

[Source](http://otvaga2004.ru/tanki/v-stroyu/razvertyvanie-v-gsvgzgv/) the tank types in Russian language.

Next, I'd like to point out that T-72 vs T-80 comparison in terms of armour is not that obvious. You can read about it in detail [here](http://tankandafvnews.com/2015/06/12/t-72b-turret-armor-exposed/#jp-carousel-1999) (sexy pics included obviously). In short, T-72B featured some interesting cavities in the front turret armour. Those cavities were filled with different types of armour that could vary from basic homogenous steel (speculated) to Abrams-like ""special"" armour (known for sure).

Moving on to answer your question. I don't know why Eugen chose T-72BU over T-80UM\T-80UE\T-80UD\T-90 obr. 1992\etc. The game takes place in the alternative universe where the USSR has not collapsed so theoretically Eugene can come with any excuse they want. From RL standpoint we can try comparing 2A46M-4 (T-80UM) vs 2A66 (T-72BU) but that won't help much in deriving tank's accuracy and stabs, while tank's AP has more to do with the APFSDS type it can operate (hello autoloader restrictions). From the armour stanpoint T-72 family has at least a mention of Relikt ERA installation possibility while the best one mentioned for T-80s is Kontakt-5, although imho Relikt could've easily been developed to be installed on T-80s if the USSR was alive. All in all, this question remains open due to events taking place in ""alternative"" universe.

P.S. Unlike what many people here claim, T-72BU\T-90 obr. 1992\T-90A are not the same tanks. More on it in Russian [here](http://gurkhan.blogspot.com/2013/11/90.html).

As you mentioned, some markets did come and go but there are now some with good operators who are working the trenches and doing it right (ie, operators who live in countries and purchase/lease servers in countries that don't explicitly cooperate with the US and EU LE/judicial systems, those who are savvy enough to utilize decent OpSec (security), and so on.) Some of these markets aren't even on the Tor/Onion network either.

With regards to figuring out how to actually utilize these resources, you just need to look for Youtube videos, man! There are plenty of videos of tutorials that spell out the whole process. It's really not that difficult, and in the end you'll have multiple connects that will undermine anyone you find on the street, at least in terms of quality (not necessarily on price). If you can't afford to spend $100 on that and an hour or two of your time, then it's obviously not worth it to you. It's understandable that people are turned away because it's not quickly gratifying, but if people just planned out their habits properly then they wouldn't need to hit the street at all anymore. I know a couple people who do exactly this and maintain some pretty big habits. 

The Russian iteration of the Silk Road has been doing it right for a long time, IIRC. There are some great articles written on how they operate. The key to making it work is by counting on the ineffectiveness of the Russian LE agencies, and making sure that every transaction stays in Russia. Cuz once they start committing crimes across country lines, there is much more attention being placed upon these markets, which attracts severely more effective LE agencies capable of taking these services down.

In general, every plant has a distinctive appearance. Leaf shape and structure, seeds, fruit, trunk, all these things are recognizable once you start paying attention.

Once you start to get to know plants, it's similar to recognizing human faces. Say you know fifty people. You know instantly, without thinking about it, whether a given person is your mom or your friend Charles Mondiguez. If somebody from a planet where everyone looks alike were to ask you, how do you recognize all these people? you likely wouldn't come up with a quick answer. Is it the nose? The eyes? The mouth? It's a combination of things you just recognize. Likewise, you can tell almost instantly if somebody is from East Asia, South Asia, Africa, Southern Europe, Northern Europe, Native America, and so on.

For me, recognizing plants is like that. I started learning about plants around 2009 out of personal interest - it has nothing to do with anything I've ever studied - and now I can walk around my neighborhood and point things out and say, ""Oh, that's definitely an oak; that's Norfolk Island Pine; that shrub right there is going to produce soapberries.""

Even though there are millions of species of plants, they are all very distinctive and easy to tell apart once you know what to look for.

Sometimes you'll have closely related species which are harder to tell apart, but even then, you'll know what genus and family it's in. Oaks are like that. There are about six hundred species of oaks native to Asia and North America (including Europe); some are distinctive, some look really similar to one another, but you always know it's an oak because oaks usually have distinctive leaves and produce acorns. There are 2,000 species of palm trees, many of which are present in South Florida (native and exotic), but they are very easy to tell apart based on height, leaf shape, trunk texture and shape, fruit, and so on. Some palms have very distinctive features which makes it obvious, such as queen palm or Madagascar triangle palm. Sometimes closely related trees will have distinct features which make them easy to tell apart, sometimes they don't. But if I can't tell exactly what some tree is, I'll always at least know which family it's in.

If you'd like to learn more about plants, do this. (If you have a camera.) Spend time walking around in your neighborhood, and pay attention to the plants, all of them. The trees, the shrubs, the grasses, the vines, the so-called weeds, the pioneers growing from cracks in the sidewalk, the lawn-borne wildflowers in danger of being mowed, and so on. Notice the leaf shape and color, and try to look for distinct features such as flowers, fruit, tendrils, thorns, or trunk texture.

If you see something that catches your eye, take a picture and post it to r/whatsthisplant. They will likely know what it is. Once you find out, look it up on Wikipedia. Read about it, and try to catch the following details: Where is it native to, what is it used for, is it edible, what are its ecological roles in its native habitat, how long does it live. Also see if there are any interesting details. Prickly pear cactus, for example, has a funny story about when they introduced it to Australia.

For every species page on Wikipedia, there is a ""sidebar"" on the upper right side, usually underneath the photograph, where it spells out the kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species, usually with clickable links. Once you finish reading about the species, click on the genus and read just a tiny bit about it - you're not trying to become an expert, just satisfying an idle curiosity - find out the other members of the genus, see if there's only two or three or if there are hundreds, see if there are any plants in the genus which are familiar to you, such as mangoes or broccoli. Then look at the family. After a few months of doing this, you'll notice there aren't *that* many families, and you'll start to get to know them. They all end in ""-aceae."" Solanaceae. Fagaceae. Cannabaceae. Poaceae. I personally pronounce it ""ay-see-ay,"" but I could be totally wrong. Who cares. I like that pronunciation. Then finally check the order - there really are just a few, only about a dozen in each major group.

The top two levels of plants will become familiar to you quickly. (I'm going to skip to the top level and then go back down to the middle; at these levels, plant classification doesn't really use ""phylum"" and ""class"" and all that.) At the highest level, **there are four main types of land plants**, which are very easy to identify at a glance. They are angiosperms, gymnosperms, mosses, and ferns. (There are actually three more types of photosynthesizing organisms, for a total of seven; the other ones are aquatic and marine species that include seaweed, algae, and worts, but those aren't worth getting into unless you're *really* interested. Shit starts to get weird there; for example, not all seaweeds are universally considered to be plants. By the way, I know all of this from reading Wikipedia.)

If you're still reading this, I will now give a brief description of each major category of plants, in the order of when they evolved.

First, the weird stuff I just mentioned - the aquatic and marine plants, seaweeds, the worts: hornworts and liverworts, which evolved in water. (Edit: I don't know anything about the wort plants; apparently some do grow on land and they did evolve more recently.) There are also lichens, which are not mosses, and are really weird organisms in that they are a symbiosis of plant cells and fungal cells. Fungi, by the way, are more closely related to animals than they are to plants.

Next there are the mosses, which are the first land plants. They came out of the ocean ""shortly"" after the Cambrian explosion. (Edit: Maybe they didn't.) Like the weird groups, they are non-vascular, which means they don't have strong or rigid bodies and cannot perform certain functions such as transferring water from one part of their bodies to another. This is why mosses tend to be short, small, and close to the ground. For millions and millions of years, mosses were the only land plants; they grew in and around bare rock, opening the way for the next phases of plants.

After mosses is ferns. Like mosses, ferns reproduce with spores and not seeds. Ferns, however, do possess vascular tissue and can grow to great heights. You can always know a plant is a fern if you look underneath the leaf and see [these](http://www.newenglandtrailreview.com/image/connecticut/talcottmountainstatepark/ridgeloop/dsc01411.jpg) dots. Those are the spores. There are other types of ferns like equisetum that look like tall grasses. Back in ancient times, there were massive giant ferns which grew as big as tall trees do today, but without wood.

The next two types of plants that evolved are the seed plants. First, the gymnosperms. There are four main types of gymnosperms, but the thing they have in common is (for the most part) they produce pine cones. Their name means something like ""exposed seed,"" because their seeds are directly exposed to the outside world. Pine trees and conifers represent one of the four main types of gymnosperms. The other three are ginkgos (a once brilliantly diverse group which today has only one living species, the biloba; this tree is considered a living fossil), cycads (they look similar to palm trees but are not related), and a really weird type of plant from the Namibian desert called Welwetschia with specimens that can live for over 2,000 years.

The last group, the most recent to evolve and the most diverse, is the angiosperms. Their name means ""seed inside"" or something like that. Angiosperms are distinct because they produce fruit and flowers. If you see a plant and it has a fruit or a flower, it is an angiosperm. The vast majority of plant foods you eat - except pine nuts and seaweed, I guess - come from angiosperms. They are distinct from gymnosperms because their seeds come packed inside of a fruit.

Compared to the other plants, which had established themselves even before the first reptiles split from amphibians (edit: or shortly after), angiosperms evolved extremely recently - about 65 million years ago, around the same time as when the dinosaurs died out and mammals and birds began taking over. Curiously, bees first showed up at around the same time, too.

If you start learning more about your local plants, chances are that the vast majority of what you'll find will be angiosperms or gymnosperms. You'll know which is which (but you won't know which is which you'll just strut what the fuck) because gymnosperms have pinecones and angiosperms have flowers. You can learn about the categories of gymnosperms in a day from Wikipedia.

In Angiosperms, there are a few main categories, and you will notice the same ones over and over as you go on. Rosids. Magnolids. Asterids. Eudicots. That's about it. Almost everything you find will belong to one of those. The more plants you look up, the more you'll be able to place them as belonging to one of these major groups.

That's pretty much it. I'm not sure if all of that was coherent, or if it was clear, or why I typed all that out in response to your comment, and I can't guarantee you that it's all correct, but there it is: A brief tour of the plant kingdom. If I were to conclude this, I'd say plant a vegetable garden at home, along with fruit trees and native trees; pay attention to the wildlife that uses your local plants, including insects, or which types of trees the birds make nests in; and never jump to the conclusion that a plant you don't recognize is a ""weed;"" it is likely a pioneer helping to clean up the ravaged soils and restore nitrogen, and it's likely providing pollen and nectar for your local bees and butterflies.

It was a tactic of last resort. He doesn't care about democracy or the will of the Greek people. He wanted to strong arm the rest of Europe. He was so confident that the EU had to make a deal that he even proposed a third bailout and another debt restructuring. Proposals that as far as I know were either never on the table or always firmly rejected when mentioned. He did all this without even mentioning what Greece was willing to offer in return.  

He dropped these demands in the heat of the moment in a take-it-or-leave-it sort of ultimatum. I don't think he even considered the possibility that they wouldn't accept. He thought Europe would cave for fear of the consequences but he was wrong.

 Tsipras thought control capitals  would never happen as it puts a huge risk to to have a yes in the referendum. Now he has to go back to try to get the control capitals over and he has to propose an agreement to the EU.

Nice! We are getting somewhere! Not just empty phrases! [Here](http://www.oecd.org/ctp/tax-policy/revenue-statistics-and-consumption-tax-trends-2014-greece.pdf) you can see that Greece tax burden and collection looks pretty much on par with other OECD countries.

The greek economy also has the highest rate of cash-only self-employed businesses in the EU, which makes increasing taxation efficiency a hard problem.

It then examines English as a special case. It also touches on Esperanto as the pre-eminent created auxiliary language but also touches on organically formed auxiliaries like Tok Pisin. Finally, the series concludes with an examination of what it will take for a true universal language to occur. The conclusion is that English is perhaps already there. What English lacks presently is a tolerance around a diversity of speaking voices (accents) and Pigin-like short-cuts. Natural speakers tend to look down on those who do not speak English as they imagine it 'ought to be spoken'. Whereas, in truth, like Pisin or even Esperanto, tolerating a diversity of approaches and ideas - as long as meaning is conveyed - could take English from its current position as the World's most common second language to a true universal language. Despite his view about the almost inevitable dominance of a new global English (Globish?) he, like me, still advocates learning Esperanto. I think that's where my head's at. I am trying to learn Esperanto - not because I truly believe it is going to be a universal second language - but because it's fun and easy to learn. I also think it's a gateway language for learning other (European) languages. Esperanto has a place. It's just probably not the place Zamenhof hoped for.

&gt; Actually it all goes to Greece because they have so far refused to pay back even the interest. 

Greece hasn't taken even one single loan *in a year*. It has to be the only country in the capitalistic economy paying the debts from its own coffers with no refinancing *at all*.

&gt; They've had ever more bailout money instead of gradually weaning themselves off and they've made their deficit worse instead of better.

[Less than 10% of the bailout money went to the Greek people](http://jubileedebt.org.uk/press-release/least-90-greek-bailout-paid-reckless-lenders). The other 90% went to bail-out irresponsible private bondholders who gambled and lost.

Greece has had one of the [most brutal fiscal adjustments](http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2012/11/primary-budget-deficits.png) and one of the [most brutal cases of austerity.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CEeWeXKUIAIxYYA.jpg:large). Greece's collapse in GDP is much worse than the Great Depression, the worse case of GDP collapse in the post-WWII history in the western world.

&gt; Greece takes the money meant for reconstruction and squanders it on overly generous social programs and unnecessary civil servants. Then cries it needs more and calls the people giving it money Nazis.

The crisis in Greece is directly correlated with the skyrocketing of the private debt, not the public debt. In 2000-2009, public debt rised 20% while private debt 200%. The huge private debt led to huge public debt in the whole Europe, when they collectively gave the taxpayers money to cover bank losses, not the other way around.

0,2,Capsulets,t5_2qhcv,"&gt;So you're happy to have your products regulated by the EU, and have companies regulated by the EU... but have no control over that regulation? Really?

Obviously you have very little experience working in any sort of industry which is required to adhere to different regulations in different parts of the world, so its not surprising that you don't understand how it works.

To you, having to meet different regulations in different parts of the world seems like a huge undertaking, but for anyone who knows what they are talking about, it is just a part of the job. 

&gt;(which includes our entire Nuclear industry, Water Industry, Rail, Energy, our Pharmacies etc. All of which would be regulated by the EU because they're all owned by European companies), 

You are completely wrong here, where are you getting your information? Any company, UK based or from elsewhere, who wanted to build a nuclear power station in the UK would have to follow OUR regulations, as regulated by the ONR. End of story. 

&gt;In fact we do have a means of regulating how banks in China and banks worldwide operate, its called SWIFT, it's based in Brussels and it controls and operates the network which connects all banks globally. Banks have to meet certain standards to use it, and the EU regulates the trade of foreign owned banks operating within the EU.

SWIFT is a globally agreed standard for sending financial information. Its like saying that E-mail is a form of regulation. In addition, the only country that has ever been denied the use of SWIFT was Iran. And that was only because the US government introduced sanctions against the SWIFT organisation itself, for breaching sanctions in place against Iran. The reasons were political and military, not regulatory. 

&gt;We do indeed have a voting role in regulating American plugs through the International Standards Organisation incidentally.

Sorry but you have no idea what you are talking about. ISO is a mainly industry related body which facilitates the development of international standards in industry. They have never been involved in the development of any domestic ISO wall plug. How could they be? You cannot have a standard UK/US plug/socket without a total overhaul of one countries power network. And that's just creating a standard between 2 countries. 

&gt;The current situation is far from the exception. We are members of the World Trade Organisation via the EU, our interface with NAFTA is through the EU, as is our interface with the Asian Free Trade Area, Indian Free Trade Area, The Common Market For East and Southern Africa and dozens of others - EVERYONE is in a free trade area of some kind, as this handy map shows[1] .png)

Not sure what your point is here. We want more free trade, and leaving the EU would help facilitate that. We could still trade freely with the EU, and also create free trade agreements with the other blocks. 

&gt;Frankly the mendacious crap spewed by the likes of Farage and your self appals me - you're astonishingly ignorant of world trade but sit there and snipe like you know what you're talking about.

Have Liverpool bought the next Coutinho, or been ripped off?

 IT WAS one of those offhand remarks that betrayed an important truth. After interviewing Philippe Coutinho, I bumped into Brendan Rodgers in Melwood’s car park. “You were seeing Philippe?” he asked, smiling, “we’d love to get more like him.”

Indeed, finding the next Coutinho seemed a Liverpool obsession after the Brazilian’s 2013 capture from Inter Milan. An obsession in money terms: snaffling such talent for just £8.5m spawned an unhealthy addiction to bargain-seeking.

This was the week Liverpool kicked it. The package for Roberto Firmino involves paying Hoffenheim up to £29m and committing £26m in wages, an outlay worth more than one-third of the £150m cost of Anfield’s reconstruction. Firmino is no bargain. And yet Rodgers could at last have his new Coutinho. Liverpool forgot price to focus on why Coutinho worked as an investment in playing terms.

He has technique, he can be spontaneous and imaginative in using it, yet he accepts tactical disciplines and (more than any English starlet would) being shifted around different roles. It’s a professionalism that stems from the conviction that nothing, even expressing your flair, is more important than doing what it takes to win. It’s a very South American thing. And so is Coutinho’s durability, despite his baby-face, boyish build and the physical nature of the Premier League. “The physicality is no problem,” he shrugged in our interview.

The South American footballer: skill, with street toughness; ability with edge. Liverpool also found it with Luis Suarez and that they’ve gone back to South America to seek the spark they’ve missed since Suarez left is further testimony to that continent’s player production line.

Ability with edge. English clubs  used to look north for that mix, to the players once spilling from the tenements and pits and steel towns of Scotland. Now, the search goes south, to the Americas of Suarez and of Alexis Sanchez, who has so sharpened Arsenal, and of Sergio Aguero, who brings the decisiveness to Manchester City.


Manchester United and Tottenham’s record signings are South Americans, Angel Di Maria and Erik Lamela, who haven’t yet become but still have potential to be their clubs’ X factors. The striker chosen by Jose Mourinho to complete his title-winning Chelsea side was Diego Costa, naturalised by Spain but born, shaped and hardened in Brazil.

Costa came from obscurity and poverty — “his village is beyond the sunset, he’s still that guy” Mourinho says — as did Suarez, Aguero and Sanchez. Firmino has his own ragged back-story. From Maceio, a picturesque but violent city in Brazil’s tropical northeast, his father walked the roads selling bottles of water to drivers in traffic jams. Firmino’s dominant thought, when plucked to move from second division Figueirense to Hoffenheim, aged 19, was: “My family will never have to work again.”

Hoffenheim’s scout had noted Firmino’s application: if he failed a training exercise he listened to his coaches and tried and tried again. Liverpool supporters are revelling in internet clips of Firmino scoring volleys and flicks in the Bundesliga but also testimony from Didi Hamann. “I’ve spoken to people who have worked with him and he won’t get bullied,” Hamann said.

Ability with edge. Firmino created more chances and completed more dribbles than any Bundesliga player over the past two seasons, yet only five players made more tackles — all defensive midfielders.

He’s young — just 23 —  and hasn’t even played Europa League, never mind Champions League football, but four goals in his first nine appearances for Brazil suggest he is ready to step up. German observers see Firmino as having excelled in a top 10 team and at the point where he should play for a top five one. Manchester United liked him,  even if they decided other positions were their priority. But Bayern Munich scouted Firmino heavily and were not sure. “He is one of the best I’ve seen in more than 20 years reporting on the Bundesliga,” says German football commentator Gunter Schroth. Yet Brazilian television reporter Carlos Mota says: “For the national team he is a level below even Fred and Luis Fabiano, but let’s wait. He’s still young and it is possible he’ll grow. For me, a very expensive ‘bet’ by Liverpool.”

That the Premier League is increasingly putting its money on South Americans brings England in line with the rest of the world. Barcelona have the best team thanks to Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi and, from Romario to Ronaldo to Ronaldinho, they’ve been buying them for years. So, too, Real Madrid, Bayern, Paris Saint-Germain and most of Portugal and Serie A. Drive through Botafogo, in Rio de Janeiro, at 1am and you’ll see players on the floodlit beachside pitches: the production line works overtime.

More than 500 Brazilians play professionally in Europe and in 2008, a high point of spending, before recession tempered clubs around the globe, 1,200 Brazilians left their country to play abroad, in moves worth $250m. Brazilians are such willing exports because of economics. As recently as 2010, 60% of players in Brazil were on the minimum wage.


ROGON, the German agency who represent Firmino, have a Brazilian subsidiary with offices in Rio, Salvador and Porto Alegre, and have just helped Hoffenheim replace Firmino with the Brazil Under-17 forward Joelinton. Across Europe’s big five  leagues, Brazil leads the way in providing expatriate players then, after France, it’s Argentina.  Brazilians don’t always thrive in the Premier League and Firmino is  joining one of the world’s most scrutinised clubs. But Liverpool have done well with Brazilians. Lucas Leiva is their longest-serving player. Coutinho talks about the “Brazilian feel” of clannish, informal, Merseyside. “Liverpool is a friendly club and I feel part of a big family. They’re as friendly as Brazilians. There’s a Brazilian way of dealing with [a personal relationship] in Liverpool,” he says.

Firmino will play where Rodgers wants. He was a “false nine” when scoring 16 and assisting 12 Bundesliga goals in 2013-14 and moved to the flanks, with a focus on pressing defenders, as Hoffenheim adopted a more defensive style last season. He’s the 29th player signed since Rodgers arrived in 2012, Nathaniel Clyne is poised to become the 30th, and at some point Liverpool must stop recruiting and settle their squad. But a spark was necessary. And Firmino is from the right part of the world — a good, if expensive, bet.",t1_csoi8yb,t3_3bqeex,0,,,,20,False,,1437486007,LiverpoolFC,False,False,0,1435740020,t3_3bqeex,csoi8yb

0,7,daudder,t5_2qh9a,"Paywalled:

The U.S. State Department on Tuesday punched a big hole in Israel-led efforts to induce the Obama administration to regard boycotts of settlements as identical to boycott of Israel proper. In doing so, it provided the Israeli government and the pro-Israel lobby with yet another painful lesson in the pitfalls of being too clever by half and biting off more than one should chew.

A special statement issued by the State Department Press Office on Tuesday afternoon made clear that while the administration “strongly opposes” any boycott, divestment or sanctions against the State of Israel, it does not extend the same protection to “Israel-controlled territories.” Rather than weakening efforts to boycott Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, as Israel supporters had planned, the State Department was actually granting them unprecedented legitimacy.

The statement came in the wake of President Obama’s signing of the Trade Promotion Authority bill, which grants him the authority he had sought to conclude the Trans-Pacific Partnership accord. But as the bill deals with free trade agreements in general, a clause was inserted in the Senate by Democratic Senator Ben Cardin and Republican Senator Rob Portman and by Representative Peter Roskam in the House of Representative that instructs American diplomats to include opposition to any boycott of Israel - or of persons from “territories controlled by Israel” - in their free trade negotiations with the European Union.

The State Department statement, however, makes clear that the bill will not change U.S. policy towards the settlements. “The U.S. government has never defended or supported Israeli settlements or activity associated with them, and, by extension, does not pursue policies or activities that would legitimize them,” it said. It went on to note: “Administrations of both parties have long recognized that settlement activity and efforts to change facts on the ground undermine the goal of a two-state solution.”

The defiant rebuff of the Congressional bill comes in the wake of the recent Supreme Court decision regarding Menachem Zivotofsky that rebuffed Congressional attempts to force the administration to record “Israel” next to his city of birth “Jerusalem.” The State Department statement says, in effect, that a bill on trade authority cannot force the administration to change its longstanding policy towards Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. And just as the Zivotofsky decision weakened Israel’s hold on Jerusalem, the boycott decision only delegitimizes the settlements more than ever before.

Thus, the effort to strengthen the settlements, supported by AIPAC and other mainstream and right-wing groups and opposed by J-Street and organizations on the left, actually ends up weakening them. The attempt to blot out the differences between a boycott of Israel and of the territories actually highlights them. The boycott of settlements, in effect, has now been officially stamped “kosher” by the State Department.",t1_csoic8v,t3_3bqevi,0,,,,7,False,,1437486081,worldpolitics,False,False,0,1435740385,t3_3bqevi,csoic8v

Please, I just read about both battles from various articles:
Battle of Mohi:
The king mobilized troops, some nobles didn't even join him because they had that little faith in him. So he had less men then he hoped for. The king was a terrible commander, and troops had little faith in him. 

Liegnitz: Basically four small armies joined together to try and fight the mongols (a separate mongol detachment from the one in hungary) this one fighting in poland concurrently to prevent reinforcements to Poland. The polish army was so lackluster that they ""had a large amount of untrained and poorly equipped men, sometimes with no weapons other than the tools of their trade""(straight from your wiki link). There were some well trained mercenaries there, including "" French Knights Templar and Hospitaller"" but only 500 men total, this is a small number of well equipped and trained units. 

An actual army was on it's way to Hungary:
""Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, who had been a day's march away, fell back to gather reinforcements from Thuringia and Saxony upon learning of the defeat. He was overtaken by the Mongol vanguard at Kłodzko. However, his force was far larger and more powerful than the host at Legnica, and the Mongol detachment was routed by the Bohemian cavalry. As Baidar and Kadan's orders had been to serve as a diversion, they stayed to keep the Bohemian forces tied up, avoiding confrontation with the larger army while splitting up into bands and sacking minor towns and villages. Eventually, they turned away from Bohemia and Poland and headed southward to join Batu and Subutai, who had soundly defeated the Hungarians at the Battle of Mohi.""

Also, King louis the IV was preparing for battle with the mongols, but the mongols retreated back to their capital.

0,8,markgraydk,t5_2wbw4,"We have a new government!

A few weeks ago I wrote about the general election in Denmark that took place on 18 June. As you may remember the results ousted Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt from the Social Democrats for Liberal Lars Løkke Rasmussen. Sunday Løkke completed the rounds of negotiations with supporting parties and presented his cabinet to the Queen. It will be the smallest minority government in a few decades consisting only of Løkke's liberal party Venstre (34 out 179 seats). 

Pundits and commentators predict a rocky and short-lived government since Løkke has to find parliamentary support among parties with diverse views. His primary supporters are the Danish People's Party, a social-conservative, immigration-focused party that came out ahead in the election, the liberal party Liberal Alliance that favors tax cuts but is less concerned about foreigners and the Conservatives that is currently somewhere in-between the two. Together they have a 1 seat majority in parliament and though party loyalty is strong and few expect defection from an MP parties on both sides of the isle may attempt to find alternative majorities outside the government. 

This is perfectly legal with our flavor of parliamentarism but will mean that Løkke will have to work hard at placating both his primary supporters or cross the isle to work with the opposition. Historically many bills do come with participation from parties that formally do not support the government so this is nothing new but extent required here is novel. As an example, the former government of the Social Democrats, Social Liberals and, for a time, the Socialist's People's Party, had to work within the confines of laws and agreements that the Social Liberals had supported with Liberal-Conservative government they ousted in 2011. The laws were mostly on labour market and benefits policy but in general the Social Liberals could with only a minor share of seats (17) largely set the direction on economic and other policies. Parliamentarism can be fun sometimes.

International media have largely called the election a win for xenophobia due to both the rise of the DPP (21% of the vote, 37 seats) and the general discourse during the campaign where several parties campaigned on some form of platform to curtail refugees, immigrants etc. Though I'm personally not happy about the election results a lot of this has been overstated. We will see less support for the EU and new bills on immigration and refugees but in a regional setting the DPP is not as far-right as they sometimes come. 

The upstart party The Alternative had a surprisingly good election. They now have 9 seats but few think they will be able to spend them much for political influence. Situated on the left (best described as a Green party) they support full reserve banking, a reduction of working hours to 30 per week and universal basic income. 

The economic policies of the new government will by and large not change much over the former one. Main differences will be a larger focus on curtailing public sector growth and taxes. There are talks on lowering the top marginal rate as well. Again, due to the slim majority and diverse parties supporting the government (where the DPP is largely center on economic policy) we do not know what the outcome will be. Expectations are that the DPP will negotiate tougher policies on refugees and immigrants for support for the economic policies. We expect a larger labor market and benefits reform this fall and the government seems to have support to lower Danish foreign aid.

0,1,MattyMattOc,t5_2qh1s,"So we're in agreement on most things until your final paragraph!

Austerity is a misnomer as applied to Greece. It needed to rein in spending and raise taxes. By last October it seemed that Greece had turned the corner. It was officially out of recession. Primary surpluses were estimated to hit 4% in 2015. Debt payments as a percentage of GDP were falling and at an estimated 2.5% were lower than in Germany and almost half what they are in Ireland. Employment had started to tick upwards. Foreign direct investment had begun to trickle into the country. Things weren't better. But they were on the way.

Syriza, in six short months, has destroyed all those gains. Tax take has tanked. The economy is back in recession (official definition - two quarters of negative growth i.e. the entire time Syriza has been in power). Debt to GDP is rising. Primary surpluses now struggle to hit 1%.

The problem with Varoufakis' thinking is that it is five years too late. His plan might well have worked had it been implemented in 2010. It's no longer 2010. Private banks are no longer on the hook. They took a 50% haircut and left European taxpayers holding the can. Neither of us think that was the correct decision to make at that time but that is where we are. Without a time machine we cannot change that decision.

Tsipras has insulted his European colleagues, the very people arguing to extend terms and reduce rates on Greek loans 8 short months ago (debt reduction by another name) are so disillusioned with Greece that they're now willing to allow it to commit suicide. Tsipras has created such a toxic environment that writing off €240,000,000,000 is now preferable than continuing to deal with Syriza to the majority of European citizens. That is actually quite an achievement; it is the single greatest European diplomatic disaster since the breakup of Yugoslavia!

And it's going to get worse. Syriza's populist promises are now bandied about as economic fact. Last night saw thousands march in support of the government and thousands march in support of a ""Yes"" vote. This weekend brings a massively divisive referendum. If a ""Yes"" vote carries the day Tsipras has said he will resign. Do you think he'll go quietly? Or, as he did 7 short months ago, when he brought down a democratically elected government in a bald grab for power, do you think he'll try to hang on? Will he even hold the referendum if it looks like he'll lose?

And what if he's victorious? Greece will have voted ""No"" to its European neighbours and to International law. Syriza would have the Greek population believe that it can have it both ways. Default and Europe. It cannot. It is choosing between one and the other. I have no hesitation in allowing someone make the choice but I have a massive problem with politicians, either through ignorance or wilful subterfuge, misrepresenting what that choice actually entails.

We're looking at a radical left wing party who's leader has been a communist since his teens - a time when Communism was literally crumbling in the streets. These are not offered by way of judgement, rather as historical fact. 

Many look at what Syriza are saying. I look behind that and, honestly, I just see another political party lying to its population for short term political gain. That its fables are attractive is irrelevant. They are also economic impossibilities.

And ultimately, my friend, this is bigger than economics. This is an entire nation of people riven asunder by lying populist politicians who, in six months in power have offered zero by way of workable solutions, other then berating their neighbours for not giving them more money.

After the vote this weekend beware of skirmishes. And know this, if Syriza refuse to go quietly, those who encouraged their defiance of international law become directly responsible.

Europe is at a delicately fragile stage of its development. The Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, less than 60 short years ago. Yugoslavia erupted in bloody violence less than 25 years ago.

Slovakia did not lend a single euro to Greece.

After the Greek debt crisis, ESFS/ESM was created. EU members were called to contribute to the fund, which would help distressed countries in an event of a crisis. 

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Stability_Mechanism) are the contributions. You many notice that Greece contributed as well, and in fact the contribution both in terms of actual % and per GDP/capita was higher than many other countries.

Ideally, the answer is 0. If you are in an area with poor public schools and the private schools are better, I would look at the pricing.

If you can afford to cover all of your basics, are out of any high interest debt, have an emergency fund, are properly insured, and can save 10% or more for retirement the answer is really as much as you feel comfortable with. If it would prevent you from doing those things, you cannot afford it. You need to get your financial house in at least basic order before spending money on things like private school. 

Since private schooling is a luxury and not a need, I don't think this is the sort of thing that lends itself to rules.

1. Greece is not the end destination of the bailouts. The money is paid, almost immediately, to European banks. To that extent, this isn't a question of whether Germany can trust Greece with the bailout money. Nobody has any doubt about where the money will end up.

2. Greece hasn't carried out ""half-hearted reforms."" It's carried out truly savage cuts to public spending, the likes of which would cause a revolt in other countries. Imagine cutting pensions by 50%, letting 30% of government employees go, virtually eliminating unemployment insurance, drastically reducing spending on healthcare, and raising VAT levels to some of the highest levels in Europe. Those ""reforms"" hit very hard. Some of the effects have been sustained 25% unemployment and 50% youth unemployment, and a contraction of GDP by more than a quarter. Greece has borne more and cut more than any other Eurozone country in this crisis.

This isn't an issue of trust about what will be done with the bailout money. Everyone knows exactly where the money will go. This is an issue of the German government wanting Greece to address its long-term problems in a fundamentally different way than the elected Greek government wants to. Germany is demanding yet more cuts in social spending and increases in consumption taxes. The Greek people voted in a government that wants an end to austerity policies, and their replacement by policies of reorganizing the Greek state to be more effective (in collecting income taxes, for example) and modest government investment to promote growth.

What a lot of people don't know about or don't realize is that the German (and much of the world) hatred of Jews was happening long before WWII and German propaganda was much more than ""They are lesser beings, they are scum, they are filth.""

In many areas of Europe, Jews were seen as self-isolating and self-serving. They were painted as crooked merchants who would only ever spread their wealth within Jewish communities. The ""Shylock"" stereotype of the cheap Jew had been around for centuries, and people were buying into it long before the Nazis. This wasn't helped by the fact that most Jews in Europe at the time tended to live in ghettos, where other cultural groups rarely ventured and looked down upon as hubs of criminal and/or immoral activity.

Now, you've also got to remember that until Hitler, Germany was *not* doing so great. Hitler revitalized the economy, created a strong sense of national pride, and made Germany a world power to be reckoned with. So now you've got this guy who's been giving Germans the opportunity to feed their families, and work for a unified Germany, and become rich and fat and happy and sit at the top of the pyramid after years of poverty and struggle. And he's saying ""But we gotta kill the Jews, first.""

Well, a lot of poor people were willing to do that in order to feed themselves and their families. A lot of people truly believed that Jewish culture was destructive to Germany's self-sustenance because that's what they'd been taught their whole lives. And the ""higher-minded"" and educated individuals backed up the slaughter by using eugenics as an excuse (eugenics is bad, guys).

So it's not really a matter of having a soul or not. A lot of people were just desensitized to the Jewish/gay/mentally ill/black/Roma plight. They viewed them as ""other"" because they never had a reason to view them as having the same intellectual capability as them.

In many ways, concentration camps actually created sympathy for the Jews among the German population; seeing them up close, watching them suffer and communicate, a lot of German guards realized that the Jews were no more corrupt or evil or responsible for Germany's welfare than they were.

&gt;Klaus Iohannis’s election as Romania’s president broke several records.

&gt;The country’s first ethnic German president swept to office in November thanks in part to a record number of votes from nearly 400,000 Romanians living abroad. With 1.5m Facebook followers, he also has more digital fans than any other European politician.

&gt;The victory of the mayor of the small Transylvanian city of Sibiu over the powerful political machine of Victor Ponta, the prime minister, was hailed as emblematic of the embrace of a newer, cleaner politics seven years after Romania joined the EU.

&gt;Mr Iohannis has supported the DNA anti-corruption agency, set up under EU pressure in 2005, in its battle with Mr Ponta’s Social Democratic party but critics say he has often been relegated to the role of bystander.

&gt;But in his first major English language interview as president, Mr Iohannis says his desire to clean up Romanian politics remains. “Many expect quick changes, which are obviously not going to happen immediately,” he says.

&gt;“But by expressing views, by saying things, by bringing people’s attention to things, this moves things — but at a slow pace.”

&gt;Sitting in a wing of the Cotroceni Palace in Bucharest modified by Nicolae Ceausescu, the former communist dictator, Mr Iohannis has a measured tone that marks him out from many of his opponents.

&gt;For the 93 per cent of Romanians who believe graft remains endemic among the post-communist political elites, the former physics teacher represents a rupture with the establishment — the new face of an open and western-minded Romania.

&gt;Mr Iohannis’s most significant interventions have been to support the DNA and the pressure he has put on MPs to reject a bill granting politicians an amnesty from prosecution.

&gt;DNA prosecutors won more than 1,000 convictions last year and indicted a further 1,100 suspects. More than 90 per cent of those indicted were convicted — performance hailed as exemplary by its supporters and disturbing by its critics.

&gt;“There is no way around it, you cannot fight corruption with white gloves,” he says. “It will take as long as is necessary.”

&gt;Dawn raids and the arrests of prominent business and political figures are a daily feature of Romanian life. Analysts say the mood in Bucharest’s government circles darkened in April when Dan Sova, a close associate of Mr Ponta, was charged.

&gt;The anti-graft campaign has now entered what Mr Iohannis calls “an ugly phase”, with prosecutors turning their attention to Mr Ponta himself. He is suspected of involvement in fraud and a conflict of interest in appointing Mr Sova to a government role.

&gt;The prime minister denies the charges and won a confidence motion in parliament comfortably a week after the allegations became public. He has since taken a month-long leave of absence for treatment in Istanbul for a knee injury. Mr Iohannis insists he should quit.

&gt;“The best way to deal with it is to resign,” he says. “If he’s not guilty as he claims, then there is no problem . . . but it’s unacceptable for a European country to have its prime minister accused by prosecutors of illegal acts.”

&gt;Analysts say the government is in survival mode and elections are likely before its term expires in November 2016. Mr Iohannis recently appointed Gabriel Oprea as interim prime minister pending Mr Ponta’s return from Turkey.

&gt;Mr Iohannis’ responsibilities are not just domestic. He is also one of 27 EU leaders whose support David Cameron, the UK prime minister, must win if he wants to redefine Britain’s relationship with the union.

&gt;Romanian officials describe some of Mr Cameron’s proposals, such as shutting off EU workers in Britain from tax credits for four years, as unacceptable.

&gt;Mr Iohannis said he understands Mr Cameron’s need to address public concerns on migration and welfare fraud but warns against proposals that would discriminate against Romanians.

&gt;“Freedom of movement is extremely important for the EU — it is one of the principles upon which the union is built.”

&gt;Mr Iohannis also reaffirms Romania’s commitment to EU sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine and welcomed Nato’s increasing presence in Romania, which hosted more than 100 military exercises this year.

&gt;“This is an important reassurance for Romania as a country right on the eastern flank [of the alliance]. On the Black Sea coast, we see very frequent flyovers by Russian planes,” he says.

&gt;But if Romania continues to struggle with the fallout from corruption allegations, Mr Iohannis may find domestic challenges crowd out foreign policy concerns. ",t1_csolclq,t3_3bnhpo,0,ROMA,Romania,,1,False,,1437488257,europe,False,False,0,1435752325,t1_csokzlp,csolclq

Before 2010 the Greek Debt to GDP was below 100%. With the Bank Liquidity Crisis that Debt to GDP shot up to 106%. By 2011 this was 170.3%. Which is the same causal relationship as the other 185 historical examples.

The Greek Government has cut spending but [Military Spending](http://uk.businessinsider.com/why-greeces-military-budget-is-so-high-2015-6?r=US) - which is very expensive - has not been cut. This is an interesting piece of spending as 15% of Germany's Military Sales are to the Greeks. If Greece makes the ""wrong cuts"" then Germany suffers.

Greece has repeatedly managed to create a [surplus](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/13/eurozone-greece-bugdet-idUSEON1U25TX20150513) through cuts.

Greece is being hung out to dry by gambling addicts - much like the working man who pays off his brother in law's debts because, ""I am in gamblers' anonymous now - so it's all good"". The Banks do not have an income to support their expenditure. Hence the Sovereign Debt Crises. All 185 of them.

0,1,hazardp,t5_2rd6n,"tl;dr - It'd be interesting to think about how a large and stable empire can exist in this period.  I'm guessing that it depends on magic, and I'd be interested to see how that's integrated into the structure of the state.

*

From your description of firearms I'm imagining arquebuses, muskets, and canons are the order of the day, rather than rifles and howitzers.  That implies technology is closer to the Renaissance than to that of the C18th+, and more precisely it suggests that there's a limit on the precision of machinery.  In our own world, this period in Europe was not one conducive to large Empires.  Former, elective ones (most notably the HRE) fell apart in the face of the new technologies of guns and the press, while the tech required for intercontinental ones had not yet been developed. Powers waxed and waned quickly, and territories frequently changed hands, disintegrated, and were created.  

I'm guessing that in your world, the impossibility for *military* or *technological* dominance is compensated for by *magical* dominance, and it is through monopolisation of this magical dominance that the state is able to exert control over a large territory.  How does the state manage to do this, and how is magic incorporated into both its bureaucracy and its military?  Are there state-sponsored magical academies in the way their were metallurgical and naval ones in our history?  Do the battlemages exist as part of a standing army, or are they mercenary, or do they volunteer when the levies are raised?

Look at Sony when they released the PS3, people tend to forget it had a $100 price drop in its first year or a $200 price drop if you wanted one without BC. They had to do the same thing last gen. Sony has always been a more global brand than Xbox anyway. North America is where the xbox market is.

No. Just look at Sony during the PS3 launch, they dominated with the PS2 and thought they were untouchable, well it bit them in the butt.

ETIMOLOGIJSKI RJEČNIK
HRVATSKOGA ILI SRPSKOGA JEZIKA
Uredili akademici
MIRKO DEANOVIĆ i LJUDEVIT JÓNKÉ iz 1988.

&gt;""Skokov Etimologijski rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika opširan je rječ-
nik visoke znanstvene vrijednosti i predstavlja temelj hrvatske (i srpske)
etimologije. Skok je prikupio obilje građe (etimološke, dijalektološke,
onomastičke, tvorbene), koliko iz hrvatskih (i srpskih) govora, toliko i iz
okolnih jezika (posebno balkanskih), no nažalost preminuo je prije nego
je prikupljenu građu stigao uobličiti u rječnik. Desetak godina poslije njegove
smrti Skokov rukopis, 10000 rukom pisanih stranica, za tisak je priredio
Valentin Putanec. Ne možemo znati kako bi taj rječnik izgledao da je
Skok poživio dovoljno dugo da ga uredi, ali je sigurno da mnogi nedostatci
proizlaze upravo iz te nedovršenosti. Danas, više od pola stoljeća nakon
Skokove smrti i gotovo četiri desetljeća nakon objavljivanja rječnika,
mnogi su dijelovi toga rječnika zastarjeli: od znanstvenih spoznaja (mnoge
tadašnje praslavenske i indoeuropske rekonstrukcije nadvladane su)
preko građe (u međuvremenu je prikupljeno mnoštvo dijalekatske i onomastičke
građe, objavljen je niz dijalektoloških rječnika te Babićeva Tvorba
riječi) do same koncepcije rječnika. Tih desetak tisuća natuknica slo-
ženih po »etimološkim familijama« (Skok 1956:20) zapravo su skup iznimno
vrijednih i podatcima bogatih lingvističkih eseja, razumljivih uglavnom
užem krugu stručnjaka, dok će se širi krug zainteresiranih čitatelja
teško snaći u tom mnoštvu podataka.""

To je zasad vrh etimologije koji nam je dostupan (kao rječnik), a radi se ozbiljno na novom. Prvo su krenuli updateati Skoka, ali su se prebacili na skroz novi rječnik. Glavni je ovdje veliki živući jezičar **Ranko Matasović**.

&gt;""Zamišljeno je bilo da se Skokov rječnik nadopuni novom
hrvatskom dijalektološkom i onomastičkom građom, s tim da se samostalne
onomastičke natuknice izdvoje, zatim da se Skokove etimologije
isprave, a rekonstrukcije osuvremene, da se njegove esejističke natuknice
razdvoje na više manjih natuknica te da se sve natuknice oblikuju na isti
način. U prvoj fazi rada cijeli je Skokov rječnik skeniran, optički pročitan,
korigiran i djelomično kroatiziran. Izdvojene su samostalne onomastičke
natuknice, označena su problematična mjesta, neke natuknice razdvojene
su na manje. Započelo se i s okvirnom podjelom natuknica po podrijetlu
na naslijeđene i posuđene riječi (romanizme, orijentalizme te ostale posu-
đenice) koje bi u sljedećoj fazi rada stručnjaci za pojedine jezike (romanisti,
orijentalisti, kroatisti, indoeuropeisti i drugi) nadopunili i osuvremenili.
Međutim, već u pripremnoj fazi rada postalo je jasno da je ponovno
izdavanje Skokova etimološkog rječnika na opisani način zadatak koji ne
bi dao zadovoljavajući rezultat, te se zbog toga započelo raditi na sasvim
novom Velikom etimološkom rječniku hrvatskoga jezika koji će se, naravno,
naslanjati na iznimno vrijednu Skokovu građu.""

However, all European ATM or POS terminals actually use the chip and refuse service if it's not present but should be, it's meant for compatibility with backwards countries, in which case the card functions as maestro and you still need a PIN.

*Technically* one could just order a SEPA debit against any account with just the account's IBAN. Then, though, those I can cancel for eight weeks if I authorised them, if they're unauthorised it's 13 months. And if they are PIN/card authorised (which happens at ATMs and POS terminals) the bank is going to say ""bad luck, shouldn't have given away your credentials"" unless mugging or such is involved at which point the police are going to get involved. If you cancel a legit transaction, they will happily give the police your address while they're investigating on the shop's behalf that you ceased to have paid for stuff.

Companies don't use SEPA debit online if there's chances of fraud, they rather expect you to wire the money to them, which generally means authorisation through online banking (password, then [TAN generated from transaction details and card](https://shops.shopping-online.de/kskfreudenstadt/images/tan_generator_200.jpg?20090528170417224645)). That is, online uses just the same wiring stuff as usual wires, systems such as [giropay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giropay) just streamline it and provide a miniscule extra service: The shop gets to know that the standard wire will arrive before it actually does, and thus can start shipping immediately.

There are no time-outs, no breaks between plays. The ball goes out of play, and you put it back in play as fast as you can.

As such, there's no need for commercial breaks. Furthermore, the rules of soccer* haven't changed that much since televisions were invented: you can watch a game from the dawn of TV and it is still fundamentally the same game: a game developed to flow without breaks. It has resisted all urges to be made more TV friendly.

No it hasn't.

The EU nations that are having huge troubles have always devalued their currency. Look it up, it happened rather regularly... Things went out of control, and they fucked over all foreign investors, and then started over again.

This couldn't be done since they now had the Euro, and hence all the trouble.

The US is a completely different case, first off because it's such a large economy, second off because most of the debt the US has acquired has been to itself. Foreign investors own very little of the US debt, and this has always been the case.

Other than that, the US hasn't usually had debt over 100% of GDP, and nowhere close to 170%, with an outlook that will only see it further increase.

If Greece has a debt of 170% of GDP, other nations can bail them out - if the US has a debt that high, that would require the entire planet to bail them out, which in reality is impossible.

&gt;Greece has repeatedly managed to create a surplus through cuts.

Your link literally shows a 2 billion dollar deficit. It's a smaller deficit than the expected, but with income of 14 billion, and expenditure of 16 billion, that's not a surplus.

The fact is simply that the financials of the Greek government is a mess. Yes it's partially because of the banks, but the government were the ones that chose to bail those banks out, they could have done like Iceland, but they chose not to.

They then chose to not do any major cuts, and simply run the largest deficit ratio a developed nation has had in 70 years.

They then ask for help, and say ""yes yes"" at meetings, then turn around and tell their people ""no no no"". It's ludicrous.

&gt;About 10% of the €240bn total bailout money Greece received in 2010 and 2012 found its way into the government’s coffers to mitigate the 2008 Bank Crisis. The rest went back to European financial institutions.

Yes, the money owed by Greek banks, and the Greeks themselves, was primarily owed to European banks &amp; nations. What's your point with stating that?

If I owe you $90, and the bank borrows me $100, then I can't use some lame excuse that ""only 10% of the money I borrowed from you actually went to my pocket""...

Tsipras, instead of supporting a nominee for president, toppled the last government. The call for election had to come from the prime minister. That's how things work in a parliamentary democracy. It doesn't change that Tsipras made a grab for power or that, like populist politicians since the dawns of time, he put his desire for power above his nation's need. 

He won the election? How very Syriza of you. Only 63% voted. Syriza got a lot less than half that. They secured roughly one vote for every four registered voters. A percentage, as you seem fond of fascist references, not so dissimilar to another nationalist, socialist party led by a populist politician with a penchant for fiery speeches and empty promises at an earlier time of European crisis. He had his supporters too. They, like you, resorted to name calling when confronted by facts.

[Syriza received just over two million votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_legislative_election,_2015). And it is using that to hold a country of 11 million people ransom and to blackmail and entire continent. More than half a billion souls held hostage by the deluded demands of a populist politician. And you accuse me of being fascist? 

The pity is that your allegiances come with such potentially tragic outcomes for a country you have no actual involvement with or no investment in. Were it not so serious, it would be hilarious watching childlike intellects attempting to grapple with the realities of the adult world. Unfortunately, it is serious.

&gt; Friend, Iran's AA network is generations behind and is only a threat to like equipped air forces. The F16 fleet Turkey has can easily destroy that network and then bomb with impunity.


[lol](http://rt.com/news/232515-iran-sepehr-radar-installed/) Also [this](http://theiranproject.com/blog/2013/02/01/ya-zahra3-iran-from-weapons-to-concepts/) I love how you people automatically dismiss non-european and Israeli countries as having a shit military to stroke your nationalistic ego. I'm not denying the US would curbs stomp Iranian AD, Iran's ECCM isn't good enough yet to go up against American ARM missiles, but against turkey it would suffice. 

&gt; Turkey's air force could absolutely wreck Iran's air force and ground military.


yes, this has been known for quite a while and I'm not contesting this the slightest, but the SAM network will definitely fare better than the armored divisions. As I said before Iran's military was built asymmetrically, after the Iraq war it was never intended to go into to open field battles head on, that would never work and would incur ridiculous casualties. I dont know why its so hard to understand, thats not how the Iranian army works, its basically Hezbollah  on steroids, if you think Hezbollah did a half-decent job against Israel in 2006, replacing them with Iranians would be devastating . . . 

Turkish airstrikes would be even more useless than Israeli air strikes on Hezbollah . . . 

The difference here however is that the Iranian military is tasked with defending the Iranian populace, a goal simply not possible to achieve against enemies like Israel and Turkey. 


Either way this is a bullshit article and war between Turkey and Iran would never even be a reality, I don't know why all the turks here are getting exited thinking about killing Iranians . . .

instead of dismissing the article as the BS it is they're getting wet thinking about war.

The Roman baths were heated in hellish furnace rooms (hypocausts), manned by slaves; fueled by timber harvested and hauled to Rome by slaves; and fed water by aqueducts built by slaves using stone and concrete quarried by slaves.

TV and films have given us a titillating and romantic view of the life of a Roman slave, but the reality was much grimmer.

Tsipras and his party (and his coalition patners) already belonged completely to Russia. 

Mind you, past prime ministers of Greece, like Antonis Samaras and Kostas Karamanlis (the 2nd), have also belonged to Russia, but their parties were mainly pro-European, so these people had limits on how much they could push a pro-Russia strategy.

0,1,macksionizer,t5_2sumr,"&gt;He goes on to say that the militia as a whole should assemble one to two times per year and that there should be a smaller subset that is well-regulated.  

&gt;He is saying that only part of the militia should be well-regulated.  

yeah, i'd agree with all that.  but the important point here is that the 2A doesn't just say ""militia"":  it says ""well regulated militia"".  that's why most scholars agree that the 2A has nothing to do general gun ownership among the wider population, who were mostly farmers and naturally had hunting rifles to feed themselves anyway.  rifle ownership among rural people was assumed, and any attempt to go around taking away these rifles would have been impossible, so they weren't concerned with this notion.   

&gt;I needn't remind you that the independence of this country was not won with a well-regulated army, but with guerrilla warfare.   

this statement is completely incorrect.  it implies that ""well-regulated"" means something like ""lining up in nice neat rows and fighting traditionally"" like the British did.  no, well-regulated meant well-trained, regardless of which fighting tactics are employed.  and actually, waging effective guerrilla warfare probably requires your men to be *more* highly trained than the traditional ""line up and shoot"" style the British employed, because it sneakier and cleverer, and lining up and shooting is pretty brain-dead.  at any rate, if you doubt my take on this, run it by anybody you know who was active duty military.  they could explain this much better than i.  

&gt;has everything to do with the general public's right to keep and bear arms and then to form a militia.  

it certainly doesn't have *everything to do with* general gun use among the public.  it's arguable that it includes this, but it's by no means a lock that it does even that.  in any event, the lead-in phrase of ""well regulated militia"" makes your assertion false that it has *everything* to do with that, because it's clearly not exclusive to something *other* than general gun ownership and use.  

&gt;Hamilton's paper is not the constitution  

true, but the point here is that the phrase ""a well regulated milita"" appears in many different documents of the time, and it always means pretty much what it still sounds like it means today:  ie, not just the general population, but a trained fighting force.  

one of the mistakes that 2A absolutists consistently make is in assuming that the colonists feared a centralized govt going door to door seizing weapons.  but they didn't have this fear because (1) the population of colonial America lived mostly on farms, which would make doing this totally impractical, and (2) nobody would go around seizing hunting rifles from farmers *because that's how they put dinner on the table.*  it'd be like going around today seizing people's refrigerators.  in 2015, guns aren't a necessity of life.  in 1788, for the 90% of rural-dwelling Americans, they *were*.  

so colonial era Americans weren't afraid of the *entire population* being disarmed.  it would not be possible to do.  instead, they were worried about a central govt forbidding state and local levels of govt from training their own fighting forces because this is what the armies of the European monarchs did in order to make sure that their power was absolute.  this is why the 2A says ""well regulated militia"", because its motivation was to ensure states could continue to maintain their own well trained fighting forces.  that the general public would continue to own rifles was never in doubt in the late 18th century, so it's a total misread of history to assert otherwise.  

in the late 1970s, the NRA suddenly switched from being a low key organization for hunters and sport-shooters to being a network of rabid anti-govt activists.  the 70s were great for this type of thing, because white america was reeling from a stalled economy and forced desegregation.  the gun manufacturing industry seized on this and began funding these anti-govt types.  and the best weapon they had in their arsenal was casting the 2A into modern terms as tho it had anything to do with the modern Pro Gunner type.  it didn't.  but hey, repeat something over and over enough times and it starts to sound real.   

&gt;Fighting potential =/= well-regulated.  

yes it most certainly does.  well regulated means trained and organized.  a disorganized rabble is never very effective, and it was a common complaint among the commanders of the Continental Army that the less ""regulated"" bands of fighters that the states would send them were typically the first to break ranks and retreat in battle.  Alexander the Great probably had exactly the same problem.  this is just a basic fundamental of warfare.  

for a very interesting read on this in terms of our Revolutionary War, check out the Battle of Cowpens.  the American commander actually used the prematurely retreating nature of the militias to his advantage:  he sent them out first to fire two volleys at the British, which made the British advance on them, and then when they reliably retreated, the British, sensing an easy rout, gave hasty chase...only to find themselves double-flanked by a hidden force of well-trained Continental Army regulars.  the British force was destroyed---not by ""the militia"", which was a well-intentioned but poorly trained mass of raw recruits, but by the ""well regulated militia"" that was the Continental Army.

0,1,elsparkodiablo,t5_2cneq,"&gt; What are you arguing???? What does gun regulation have anything to do with banning liquor and drugs?

Firearms crime is a symptom of much larger issues.  Stricter gun regulation isn't going to change that people are still going to murder each other over drug profits.  See: Roaring 20's, War on Drugs, Mexico, etc

The people killing each other over illicit narcotics (and alcohol back in the day) don't care about any restrictions you put up.

&gt; This is just a terrible argument. First, you assume that all or the majority of crimes are drug crimes. Second, almost every other wealthy country in the world has proven that highly regulating guns has lead to positive outcomes. Even if half of the US homicides were drug related, we would still have 2x to 3x the homicide rate of other wealthy countries. And you're assuming those other countries don't have drug problem either...they have criminal drug dealers as well.

A sizable number of crimes are drug crimes or gang related, yes.  Second, cherry picking ""wealthy countries"" ignores their lack of gang violence, war on drugs, etc.  If you think that Europe's drug problems are anything like those in the US, you are utterly uninformed.  Third, you ignore cultural differences that lead the US to be a more violent place, just like places like Japan &amp; South Korea have higher suicide rates than the US (despite a lack of guns).  

In short, you aren't very good at logic or reason.

&gt; Analogies aren't your strong point. And neither is logic. Guns don't' cause ALL crimes but guns FACTOR into crimes. Just like if you legalized machine guns and grenades, you can bet homicide rates would increase. But your ignorant logic would say ""machine guns and grenades don't cause crimes, people cause crimes"".

Machineguns and grenades are perfectly legal, please stop spouting off ignorant nonsense.  They are regulated under the 1934 NFA.  This is why you aren't equipped for this discussion, you aren't even aware of current laws, much less the likely outcomes of what you fervently wish passed.   Until you can show you have a laymans grasp of current firearms laws, stop posting bullshit like this.

This rig should suit your needs just fine. Xeon 1231 is basically an i7, but without the integrated HD4600 GPU which a)kinda sucks and b) not needed since you will be getting GTX 970. Main advantage of i7 over i5 - better load balancing due to having HT, which means higher performance per clock speed, and also better longevity - with Xeon 1231, you are pertty much safe from having to worry about your CPU for the next 4 years - you will be able to just upgrade your GPU once 970 becomes obsolete, and not overhaul half of the rig. 

CPU water cooling - not necessary when overclocking, and also, its actually quite noisy due to water pumps. Unless you buy an expensive unit that is. But if you are worried just about the noise - stock cooler is generally ok for the first year, then you will need to buy something like CoolerMaster TX3, or another cheap but good aftermarket cooler, because stock coolers have shitty bearings that wear out quickly and thus become noisy as the rig gets older.

GTX 970 is indeed the best choice for a living room PC, due to it having amazingly low thermals for the performance it gives, which means less noise as the cooling system is less stressed. That said - Strix is good, but since you are from EU, you have an option of buying Palit JetStream which is just as [quiet](http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/palit_geforce_gtx_970_jetstream_review,10.html), but is cheaper due to it being lesser known brand. 

Other than that - you have an SSD for OS and 1 TB hdd. Fully modular PSU for easier cable management. 8 GB of system memory, with an option to add 8-16GB more. Cheap but good all-black case. 1080p 60Hz IPS monitor.

No institution is permanent, that includes governments. At some point a country will leave the union. It may take hundreds of years, but it will happen. Not planning for that eventuality would just be short sighted. These are sovereign nations, they will do what is best for themselves and if they want to leave there is nothing the EU can do to prevent them (of course they could make the process painful).

0,7,k1990,t5_2ssp3,"The first state-to-state diplomatic proceedings happened on an informal basis during 1782-83, during the negotiations to end the War of Independence. Formal establishment of permanent diplomatic relations (and the recognition of the US as an independent state) didn't happen until after the signing of [the Treaty of Paris](http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/paris.html) in September 1783, which formally ended the war. 

*Ad hoc* diplomatic negotiations between Britain and the United States began in the spring/summer of 1782. The British crown appointed [David Hartley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hartley_\(the_Younger\)), as minister plenipotentiary (the formal title of an envoy or ambassador) and [Richard Oswald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Oswald_\(merchant\)) as peace commissioner, to negotiate the cessation of hostilities. The American signatories to the treaty were John Jay (then Secretary of Foreign Affairs), John Adams (a roving US ambassador in Europe) and Benjamin Franklin (ambassador to France.)

A [provisional treaty](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/prel1782.asp) was agreed in November 1782; Congress [declared a ceasefire](http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=lljc&amp;fileName=024/lljc024.db&amp;recNum=245) in April 1783 and the final treaty was signed in September. Here's [the full text of the treaty](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/paris.asp) — in Article 1, Britain relinquishes its imperial claim over the colonies, and recognises the sovereignty of the United States:

&gt; His Brittanic Majesty acknowledges the said United States, viz., New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, to be free sovereign and independent states, that he treats with them as such, and for himself, his heirs, and successors, relinquishes all claims to the government, propriety, and territorial rights of the same and every part thereof.

That's the starting point for formalised state-to-state relations. In May/June 1785, Adams [arrived in London](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/eyewitness/html.php?section=19) as the first US minister plenipotentiary to the Court of St. James. The British, for some reason, didn't appoint their first permanent ambassador to the United States until 1791, when [George Hammond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hammond_\(diplomat\)) was given the job.",t1_csor2mm,t3_3bqvdz,0,military,Intelligence and Espionage | Spanish Civil War,,7,False,,1437492560,AskHistorians,False,False,0,1435764118,t3_3bqvdz,csor2mm

0,6,salty-lemons,t5_2saej,"I see two issues here: the first being that your child will be a carrier and if your child wants to make a baby with another carrier, that makes it complicated.  I googled how common being a carrier is and the answer depends on heritage. The most likely is a european descent with a 1 in 29 likelihood.  So your child has a 1 in 29 likelihood or less of being with someone who is also a carrier.  My understanding is that being a carrier means that your child will not be ill from CF, I hope I am correct in that.  I think education is extremely important.  If you child, who is a carrier, wants to make a baby with another carrier, IVF with PGD will be the best choice, unless new technology is available.  Right now that costs around $18k+, depending on the clinic and your child might need several rounds to make it work, or only one.  Perhaps you could start a fund for that possibility?  Then if he or she doesn't end up with a carrier, your kid has a down payment on a house or something.  In the end though, if most humans had the choice between existing with the 1 in d 29 possibility of needing IVF in the future or not existing, I believe most of us would chose existing.    

The second issue is that your child may experience the loss of a parent at a young age.  For me, personally, that is a harder question than the carrier issue.  It's great you are being thoughtful about it.  I wonder if there are support groups out there for CF and/or spouses of people with CF where you could explore the issue with others who are going through the exact situation.  Ultimately though, your and your husband lives have to be about more than CF.  You both deserve to live fully.  

Personally, I don't see having a biological child as any more or less selfish than if you fostered a child longterm.  That child will still see your husband as 'dad' and that child may lose his/her dad before other kids lose their parents.  I have a real problem when people view having a bio-kid as selfish and adoption/fostering as altruistic.

Also, I don't think it's as simple as turning a dial on the press from Greece to Germany but they have access to all the materials and equipment needed to make a foreign Euro. National mints prevent counterfeiting by using unique materials and design features that require proprietary printing/manufacturing techniques, with tightly controlled supply chains that make these necessities inaccessible to counterfeiters.

I'm not sure if every Euro shares the same ""paper"", inks, and hologram/UV strips but Greece has 99% of the work done for them if that is the case. If the bills are identical in terms of material composition then Greece's printing/manufacturing equipment only needs programming/dies to produce a perfect fake.

0,1,Bowgentle,t5_2qh4j,"&gt;You keep referencing Ireland, which has a different law system from Denmark. It is inccomparable -Irish law is based off British law, which is based off court rulings. Danish law is based of a charter, like German or Dutch. Completely different aproaches.

I think you know less about Irish law than I do about Danish law - that may not have been the case this morning, but I think it is now. 

Irish law is dual - we have common law like the UK, but unlike them we have a written Constitution. So I'm thoroughly comfortable with law based on written constitutions, which is what would be applicable here.

&gt;The courts did throw up their hands, and said the European courts should handle it, and the European courts said they did not think they had the jurisdiction. Kafka was proud, and the Danish government was happy that ll their friends lent a hand with fucking the population over.

I think you need to demonstrate that this is something more than your personal take on it. Like I said, you *could* well be right, but you're not *showing* it. What I have on the events is that Maastricht was rejected at referendum in 1992, then passed by referendum in 1993 after opt-outs were secured. If that's what you're thinking of, then no, the referendum result was not ignored - it was overturned by another referendum.

Oh, so now they have low crime rates. Or perhaps you are dumb enough to think that *reported violent crime rates* is the same as *actual violent crime rates*.  European countries and other western countries have a culture and laws that ENCOURAGE victims to come forward. Not only that, but these other wealthy countries typically have a much broader definition of what is included as a violent crime....since these countries are more interested in stopping crimes.  That's why most experts typically focus on homicide rate since it's hard to not report a homicide and it's hard to categorize it as a different kind of crime. People in poor countries usually don't report crimes because they either don't trust their police or have weak policing or don't trust the prosecutors.

Those countries' cultures were irreparably damaged during the decades of European colonial rule, but I don't believe that this is cause for French or British culture to be similarly modified and transformed.

&gt; For illustration, let's say large numbers of naturally dark-haired non-European immigrants began dying their hair blonde and red and so on, and basically just found ways to look just like the natives. Would this alleviate your concerns, if they looked just like the indigenous population? Or not, because they still represent a different genetic lineage?

To be honest? It wouldn't bother me that much. Genes are invisible and have essentially no connection to culture. Morroccan immigrants to the Netherlands who completely put on the ""Dutch aesthetic"" would be no less Dutch than natives. And even physical appearance aside, I think there is little harm with immigrant groups who assimilate fully. For instance, people of African descent in the British Isles seem completely assimilated. Both West African immigrants and people with roots in the Caribbean are generally as British as Christopher Lee, while immigrants from Pakistan especially are far less integrated into British society and do not show much interest in becoming integrated.

They had institutional programs throughout public schooling to increase the college graduates, then raised the bar financially. Let '100% horizontal' mean to meet demand at the most basic level, and '100% vertical' means to allocate only to quality.

I think many agree that instead of expanding both horizontally and vertically, they allotted more towards quality, without fully meeting quality for the funds allotted and more towards perks.

This doesn't seem to make sense at a national level, but on a global level it does make sense. European schools (and maybe in the future other nations) have (and will have) a very high level of quality in both living standards and educational quality. It would be expected that the Europeans (and in the future others) will begin to apply 'reverse brain-drain'. That is, to take the US' top talents/performers that are 'falling through the cracks'.

edit: Obviously someone without European background, or looking European, will not be as excited to head towards a homogenous ""white"" nation like Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway, etc... I mean, just rudimentary research shows that the level of institutional and domestic ""racism"" there would be far higher than in the US.

Consider that in the US they have a large amount of immigration (and minorities) and a demand for ""equal access"" to education and a restricted supply. With a diminished supply and increased demand, in order to meet the 'equality' criteria, this means that many of the Americans of European/Caucasian origin will find it far more difficult to find the education they desire.

edit: Continuing along this lines, the Hispanic, Latin and African American population is expected to overcome the current majority within a decade or two. With the restricted supply a significant amount of the traditional majority will not be able to find higher education. This is assuming that allotment would be equalized based on demographics, so it is a naive assessment. It is still rooted enough to see that the amount of ""white-flight"" towards European institutions will be significant enough to apply reverse brain-drain.

---

&gt;

&gt;[Slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery) was practiced in some parts of [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa),  [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe),  [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia)  and the [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas) for many centuries before the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade. There is evidence that enslaved people from some African states were exported to other states in Africa, Europe and Asia prior to the [European colonization of the Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_colonization_of_the_Americas).  The [African slave trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Africa) provided a large number of slaves to [Europeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_ethnic_groups) and many more to people in Muslim countries.  

&gt;The Atlantic slave trade was not the only slave trade from Africa, although it was the largest in volume and intensity. As Elikia M’bokolo wrote in *[Le Monde diplomatique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Monde_diplomatique)*:

&gt;The [African](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa) continent was bled of its human resources via all possible routes. Across the [Sahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara), through the Red Sea, from the Indian Ocean ports and across the Atlantic. At least ten centuries of slavery for the benefit of the [Muslim countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world) (from the ninth to the nineteenth).... Four million enslaved people exported via the [Red Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea), another four million  through the [Swahili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_people) ports of the [Indian Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean), perhaps as many as nine million along the [trans-Saharan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Saharan_trade) caravan route, and eleven to twenty million (depending on the author) across the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean).

The idea of Anna dying has always fascinated me, not because of my views on Anna, but because I'm interested in how events would play out. I have 2 fanfic concepts that explore this question. One of them is a Kristelsa fic. 

The other takes place a couple hundred years after Frozen, though Elsa still looks the way she did in Frozen. The technology is similar to late 19th/early 20th century Europe. The world is full of sorcerers (1% of the population), but most of them are only powerful enough to be party magicians and street criminals. Truly powerful magicians are rare (0.01 % of the population), and Elsa is widely believed to be the most powerful in the world. The most powerful sorcerers fight in a war between the two dominant nations, except for Elsa. She is a total recluse, traveling aimlessly across the world in her flying ice castle. Although she mostly keeps to herself, her reputation strikes terror into the people and towns who see her castle. Her powers have become legendary, as has her reputation for immense cruelty.

Anyway, long story short (spoilers coming) it is revealed that long long ago Elsa had frozen her own heart so that she couldn't feel the heartache and guilt of killing her own sister. But doing so made her cold and indifferent to the suffering of others. It is a Frozen/Beauty and the Beast/Howl's Moving Castle crossover.

0,1,barchueetadonai,t5_2ryd5,"Thank you for the response. Your explanation of the scientific method is mostly correct in that it describes a specific subset of the scientific method. More generally, the scientific method does not necessarily require laboratory experiments, but some kind of phenomena that is repeatable in the sense that the same exact phenomena would occur under the same exact situation. Although we can’t necessarily repeat human evolution, we can see the same type of evolution occur in millions of different species. For many of the species in the past, we have numerous fossils that all point towards their evolution coinciding with changes in the environment that we can see within the geological record. When we use the many different types of dating techniques, we can see that the chronology that everything takes place in makes precise sense. Carbon dating is not the only method of dating. There are many others. If you are not convinced by the millions and millions of pieces of evidence ALL pointing towards the same thing, then I don’t know what will convince you. Clearly you don’t actually follow evidence because you are convinced by just seeing and hearing god in your head, but are not convinced my millions and millions of pieces of evidence that all point towards the same thing and can’t possibly be something just going on in your head.

Let me show you how we CAN observe evolution happening in a human lifetime. Think about the flu. It is a virus for which we can develop vaccines. These vaccines work by abusing the virus' characteristics that it got from its genetic code. Unfortunately, we need to make a new flu vaccine every year because the old one become ineffective. Why is that? It’s because a few of the virus had some genetic material that made them immune to the vaccine. Those viruses were then able to reproduce their genetic code when creating new viruses. Over time, which in this case is only a few months, most of the flu viruses are now immune to the vaccine and we need to come up with a new one. That right there is evolution. Those viruses that were immune to the vaccine were the best at fitting in with their environment. Viruses are not living things exactly, but their evolution is the same idea. We see the same thing with many bacterial infections as well. That piece of DNA or RNA that made the few viruses at first immune may not actually have been there in the first place. It may have come as an accidental mutation in one's code, yet that one beneficial mutation was enough to make the virus spread its code. If you can explain to me why this preceding paragraph does not completely show evolution, then maybe it’s wrong. I don’t suspect you actually being able to refute because you would need strong evidence as to why all of the cases of evolution I just explained are wrong and why my evidence suggested otherwise.

Let me give you an example of human evolution that we can think about, so you can see that this applies to humans too. In the middle ages in Europe, somewhere between a quarter to a third of the population died from the bubonic plague. Despite the horribly unsanitary living conditions of most people, a majority did not die. Perhaps this was because a lot of people were immune to the plague. Pretty quickly, the plague almost completely vanished. Most of the people who were susceptible to the plague had died, and the ones who didn’t were able to have children and pass on their genes. The later generations of humans then were immune. This is evolution. The organisms that best fit into their environment survived and passed on their genes.

We know the humanoid fossils are human ancestors because their characteristics and chronology follow exactly what we would expect from our understanding of evolution and the many types of evidence that show it exactly that way. We have even seen tremendous predictive power with human evolution. Many times, archaic human species with certain characteristics are theorized to have existed. At some point later, we have unearthed fossils confirming our predictions exactly.

Please please please read a lot about evolution because you will then understand why it is so universally accepted. To be fair to you, I will do your experiment with all honesty and integrity.",t1_csotnpk,t3_3b6xqr,0,,,,1,False,,1437494471,DebateAChristian,False,False,0,1435768052,t1_cso0ot4,csotnpk

Its kinda like their version of a status card, but rather different since there's a pretty shitty history of aboriginal people saying metis cannot be identified as First Nation but the goverment saying well they're something to us! I've seen the use of not so great terms like Halfblood/breed or white indians for Metis, like we don't really count because most people do not belong to a reserve. Generally on paper there's three categories Indian/Aboriginal status (could be one of many tribes, each tribe has different rules to be qualified) Inuit, and Metis. 

But the history behind the Metis people is aboriginal woman that decided to marry outside of their tribe to French trappers and/or fur traders and sorta merged cultures and languages as a result. There's a lot of people that claim to be metis because they only understand it as a person with both European and aboriginal blood. To actually be recognized by Metis organizations their are more stricter guidelines to be followed.

I'm like a example of a Metis living in a city, my Dad (who has the Metis in his blood) was raised to be a very good catholic son. Basically his grandparents who worked in the school system cared very much about their image of being good white catholic members of society. You couldn't be anything but pretend to be good normal white people. It wasn't really accepted then to be anything else so my father learned nothing of any of his heritage aside from Roman catholic. Heck! when he married my Mom, his mother rushed to her priest to ask if it was ok for her son to marry someone who was Byzantine Catholic and not Roman catholic. So I ended up being raised in the Ukrainian Byzantine Catholic church settings with nothing else, church mandatory every sunday until I was 18.

I've learned stuff on my own through aboriginal programs, my sister knows more than me but it still feels pretty alien to me to do any of the aboriginal activities like Smudges, Pow-wows, Sweats.

I'm glad. :)

&gt; My assertion is that intelligence was not a major factor in whether or not you survived the Holocaust, not that it had absolutely no correlation.

Well that's different then! I agree that it is *possible* that the effects of WWII were not *major* in this regard. It's possible that the performance of today's Ashkenazi Jews in IQ tests can be explained by a longer evolutionary history (a thousand years of persecution), as well as a culture that places a premium on intellectual results.

However: I do *not* think we can conclusively exclude the possibility that WWII had a *major* impact. In fact, my understanding of evidence about evolution is that near-extinction events result in very fast and radical adaptations.

WWII *was*, in fact, a near-extinction event for European Jews, so this possibility should not be excluded.

&gt; There was ample reason to suspect that you would have been safe in France, or at least have enough warning to escape.

Yes; but there are people who prepare, and there are people who over-prepare.

If you look at what smart rich people are doing now, they're over-preparing for a collapse of the global economy. Some are building armored survivalist mansions in Texas. Others are looking into land in Idaho, so that, if all goes to hell, they can grow potatoes and move away from everyone. Others are buying islands in the Pacific and installing infrastructure for self-sufficiency.

I'm not doing any of those things because I'd rather just hope that the global economy isn't going to collapse; because the chance I perceive of that happening is not more than 20%, and focusing on the 20% seems like a lot of wasted effort. Also because I think that life in a post-catastrophic environment is going to suck no matter how much we've stocked up.

But then, I may be stupid. Maybe I'm under-preparing, and myself, my wife, and my son may all die. :-)

If you've read Maus, you understand that a big reason the guy survived, besides huge luck, was because he was paranoid, ingenious, and didn't trust anyone. He survived, and the people who trusted their own families didn't. Those all died, for as little as a gold wristwatch.

It’s just one idea submitted as part of a general, non-legislative discussion about copyright, which is a million miles from becoming law even if MEPs wanted it to.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldowan

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinnacle_Point

http://www.humanorigin.co.za/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age

You could easily start with all of the early human developments in civilization; not least of which were culminated in the first great civilizations of Ethiopia and Egypt. Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the connection of Egyptian culture and technology to later civilization like the Sumatrans, Greeks, and Mesopotamians....

Saying these developments are unimportant would be like saying Darwin was unimportant to modern genetics or psychology, or that the Greeks were unimportant to modern medicine, philosophy, music and mathematics. I.e. it would be absurd.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

African art was the progenitor of, basically, the entire field of European abstract fine art. Picasso was fundamentally influenced by ancient and contemporary african tribal art in his seminal work which started the movement (Paris, 1907):

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Demoiselles_d'Avignon

This movement in visual art also began the interest in more 'primal', dysjunct, and atonal styles of fine art music (i.e. the entire early 20th c. movement) , particularly kicked off by the seminal composition ""The Rite of Spring"" by Igor Stravinsky (Paris, 1913):

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_of_Spring

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWotpIy0uTg

This movement was further extended by other serialist composers like Arnold Schoenberg (who was also an avid painter and art aficionado) and his students like Alban Berg, among many others:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alban_Berg

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique

Wozzeck (begun 1914)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viXMstoz5_Q

Later in the history of music, african tribal music and culture brought to the U.S. by slaves heavily influenced the development of modern popular music styles, like jazz, folk, gospel/country, and rock.

I could go on, but fundamentally it boils down to an argument that if you consider ""great"" = whatever you happen to think on a whim, then there is no argument to be had. It is just your opinion. 

An understanding of the totality of genetics and anthropology (both physical and cultural) shows that Africans have played intrinsic and essential roles in human development, from ancient times to the present. Maybe you think Caucasians are ""better"", but you are lumping on a moral adjudication on something which is intrinsically transitive in nature. If caucasians had blown up the entirety of modern civilization through mutual destruction via nuclear weapons (as we have all come perilously close to on multiple occasions) would that 'great' feat of technology be considered a huge step in evolution? In my opinion no. And a correlate probably will occur, which is the rapidly developing destruction of the Earth's habitable landmass via anthropogenic global warming; virtually entirely driven by caucasian humans. 

You would probably do well to read ""The Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins to get a better basic understanding of genetics and evolution. I'm guessing you have only a rudimentary understanding of genetics, at best, from reading some of your post history. Another really good thing for you to watch would be ""Dr. Strangelove"".",t1_csoum9z,t3_3bm30b,0,,,,1,False,,1437495435,AskReddit,False,False,0,1435769477,t1_csodxw0,csoum9z

C'est justement pour ça que les banques grecques sont fermées cette semaine et que Tsipras et Varoufakis continuent à insister que la Grèce ne sortira pas de l'euro quoiqu'il arrive.

&gt; Ton lien FT est réservé aux abonnés

Et pourtant, je n'en suis pas un et je réussis à le lire...voici l'extrait principal:

*The terms on Greece’s debt pile have become progressively more manageable. The maturity on the bilateral loans provided by eurozone member states in May 2010 has been extended to 2041 and the interest rate cut from between 300 and 400 basis points over the three-month Euribor rate, to just 50.*

*The EFSF loans, whose yield is just one basis point over the average borrowing cost of the EFSF itself, now have an average maturity of more than 30 years. In 2012, the eurozone finance ministers agreed on a grace period of 10 years over which Athens will have to make no principal repayment.*

*As a result of these changes, the average maturity of Greece’s debt is now 16.5 years, double that of Germany and Italy, according to data compiled by Joakim Tiberg, a strategist at UBS. Portugal and Ireland, which also benefit from favourable terms for their own bailout loans, have average maturities of 11 and 12.5 years, respectively.*

*Furthermore, the amount Greece pays each year to service its debts has steadily come down. Zsolt Darvas, a research fellow at Bruegel, a think-tank, has calculated that Greece’s nominal interest spending in 2014 was 4.3 per cent of gross domestic product, less than Italy or Portugal.*

*In fact, this is probably an overestimate of the real interest burden. Greece did not have to pay any interest on its EFSF loans and received back the yield it pays to the European Central Bank and other national central banks, which hold just under one-tenth of its debt. Taking this into account, Mr Darvas calculates that total interest expenditure in 2014 was 2.6 per cent, only marginally above France’s 2.2 per cent.*

*On the basis of these figures, many economists and European policy makers are questioning whether Greece’s raw debt-to-GDP figure is a meaningful measure of the burden of past liabilities on the economy.*

*“A ratio of 170 per cent does not mean anything,” said Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a former executive board member of the European Central Bank. “The debt has a very low interest rate and a maturity of over 15 years. Its impact on the economy is much lower than in Portugal or Italy,” he added.*

&gt; pourquoi la dette est passée de 110% à 175% depuis ces plans d'austérité?

Parce que, tout d'abord, [elle n'était pas à 110%, mais à 130%, mais surtout parce que le déficit annuel, avant les plans d'austérité, était à plus de **15 %** du PIB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis#Debt_levels_revealed_.282010.29). En bref: avant les plans d'austérité, l'état grec dépensait ~~7 euros pour chaque 6 euros récoltés!~~ (correction: 3 euros pour chaque 2 euros de recette! J'oubliais que les 15%, c'est 15% du PIB, pas des impôts!) L'austérité n'a pas endigué entièrement l'hémorragie, mais l'a bien freiné...

&gt; Ca dépend les sources manifestement...

La [Commission Européenne](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5270_en.htm) a mis en ligne [le projet de proposition de samedi](http://europa.eu/rapid/attachment/IP-15-5270/en/List%20of%20prior%20actions%20-%20version%20of%2026%20June%2020%2000.pdf).

For example, fly YYZ-BKK-CDG-GIG-YYZ. You can pay for intra-Asia or intra-Europe tickets since they are very cheap.  
I'm not sure if you're actually allowed to combine South America and Asia. If you'd like to do SA separately, I would recommend churning the Alaska MBNA card. For 30k points (one bonus and transfer in some SPG points, or get the card twice) you can fly to South America Region 1 (Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Venezuela) round-trip on American Airlines during off-peak season (January 16 — June 14 and
September 7 — November 14). Or 40k points to South America region 2.  
Some more notes:  
Avios are very good for direct and relatively short flights (since the cost depends on miles). For example YYZ-JFK, or BOS-DUB. This may be useful for intra-South America flights, since short flights can be very expensive there.

Não seriam estes ex-alunos os tais dos Chicago Boys, por acaso? Não foi a palestra exatamente sobre a situação econômica problemática do Chile, por acaso?

Mas eu vou para Cuba, colaboro com o governo cubano, me encontro com os Castro, e não me digam que eu apoio aquele regime, ok?

Tens completa razão quanto ao fato de que muitas vezes esquerdistas apoiaram e mesmo acabaram por criar regimes antidemocráticos — frequentemente, creio, devido à dificuldade de se lidar com divergências ideológicas, mas também por uma negligência em parte da esquerda quanto às teorias da democracia. A diferença é que a ideologia neoliberal é mais intrinsecamente antidemocrática que a socialista, pois enquanto a socialista pretende dar ao povo o poder de decidir sobre os rumos da sociedade — incluso os econômicos —, a neoliberal quer exatamente tirar este poder. A expressão ""deixe o mercado decidir"" não é uma metáfora qualquer; ao contrário, ela expressa muito bem o objetivo e o resultado do neoliberalismo: cria-se um fantasma chamado ""o mercado"" que passa a reger todas nossas vidas, em todos os seus âmbitos. ""O mercado"" vira o soberano, o povo vira seu súdito.

&gt; &gt; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a freemarket regime designed by principled believers in a free market.

Isto não é um ""milagre"", aliás mesmo no Brasil frequentes vezes se justificou a ditadura militar como uma defesa da ""liberdade"" contra a ""ameaça comunista"". Foi um ""mal menor"" necessário no momento. (E não vou dizer nada sobre a afirmação ridícula dele de que foi a liberdade econômica que promoveu o desejo de liberdade política no Chile.)

&gt; Quem são, exatamente, os economistas com menor apreço pela democracia? E é menor em comparação a que grupo de pessoas? E Lucas não é um economista atual (já tá com quase 80 anos), e o ponto é que não tem qualquer sentido citar ele nessa história, a influência política/filosófica dele é zero.

Você está tomando a questão muito individualmente. O ponto do artigo é que há esta ideologia (e é uma verdadeira ideologia) desenvolvida por este coletivo de pessoas. Lucas teve um papel menor, mais restrito dentro das ciências econômicas. Nem eu nem a autora do artigo (ou o professor citado por ela) disse nada sobre a relação dele com a política.

&gt;  Na verdade, nos últimos 30 anos os poucos que tiveram alguma influência para fora foram quase todos keynesianos, como Krugman, Stiglitz, Summers, etc

Mesmo que possa ser verdade que dentro das ciências econômicas o keynesianismo ainda tenha alguma força, o problema é que não são exatamente keynesianos os que têm tido poder político. À exceção de alguns países como o Brasil que tiveram governos de esquerda, o pensamento neoliberal domina as políticas econômicas da maior parte dos governos ocidentais. Tome como exemplo a recepção pela troika das medidas propostas pelo ministro grego Yanis Varoufakis, medidas que nada mais são do que medidas keynesianas moderadas.",t1_csow056,t3_3bar93,0,,,,1,False,,1437496501,brasil,False,1435771692,0,1435771497,t1_csnsrik,csow056

Inizio dell'articolo del Fatto: ""Proprio così, è lo stesso Paul Krugman, premio Nobel economia 2008, a sostenerlo, **titolando così il suo articolo** di lunedì 29 giugno sul New York Times."" (grassetto mio).

Titolo dell'articolo di Krugman linkato: ""Greece Over the Brink"".

E' evidente che la traduzione letterale del titolo dell'articolo di Krugman e' ""La Grecia e' sull'orlo del baratro"", e non ""Grexit: la colpa e' dell'Europa della Troika"", come sostiene testualmente il ""giornalista"" del Fatto.

E questo al di la di tutto quello che quel che poi dice Krugman nel suo articolo, su cui si puo' discutere.

Tra l'altro la stessa espressione ""l'Europa della Troika"" (usata dal Fatto e non da Krugman) e' priva di senso. L'Europa non e' della Troika, e la Troika non e' dell'Europa (uno dei tre componenti e' l'IMF, che non e' certo una istituzione dell'Unione Europea).

The same way I'm personally disgusted by other people who have fetishes and paraphilias, such as male pederesty, zoophilia, infantphilia, necrophilia, or dendrophilia, not the kind of people I'd voluntarily associate myself with. As far as I'm concerned, homosexuality is being accepted in the west and India by millennials (people under 20) not because of equality, but because of aestheticism and fetishism. It's mostly straight white women, straight white men and any woman or men who has been tainted by western culture that advocates for gay rights, have you even seen a gay pride parade on YouTube? It's nothing but near naked men doused in baby oil and twerking in a thong and dry humping each other and dick statues and phalluses and lewd behavior allowed and I'm seeing these straight white women and westernized women attending these getting wet at the sight of watching gay guys act lewd and the westernized men like to watch lesbians act lewd, fucked up thing here also is that parents bring their fuckin children to this inappropriate shit with the pre tense that it's to teach children about acceptance. 

Let me tell you something, I guarantee you that a large number of pre teen puberty boys around the world that are sexually attracted to girls older than them like I was and still is, why can't female pederesty not legalized but looked at less badly? (Let's face it, that would never be legalized). where's the harm if you have an attractive 20 something plus girl having a sexual relationship with a boy who is 13 and is curious about women? If you reversed the gender in this, it would be bad because most self respecting and moral young girls don't want to have sex with older men and the male pedophile having sex with them will painfully hurt them when he penetrates them, that doesn't happen with an older girl and little boy. My point here is that first off, the reason that homosexuality is even legal is because it was modified to just be two people of the same gender and of the same age, the Greeks and Romans were societies that practiced different paraphilias including infantphilia, zoophilia, and gay pederesty (there's a fuckton of disgusting shit that these 2 societies did that I can go all night on that would probably give you the death penalty in Western Europe). I guarantee if older girls were allowed to be straight pedophiles, that'll make a lot of young boys happy.

I'm also disgusted by homosexuality because it's unhealthy. Homosexuality is largely associated with STD's/I's and HIV/AIDS, I understand that straight people can do anal sex and get these AIDS and STD's too, but first off all most straight people don't have anal sex and STD's/AIDS are still largely associated with homosexual activity. It's been since the 80's that the AIDS virus was discovered among gay men and, despite the vast advancements of technology and medical research, We are still no closer to finding any cure to totally eradicate HIV or STD's. The best that they can do is just use condoms; you know because sex is trillions of times more satisfying when your dick is covered in rubber, and the LGBT community spreads AIDS awareness as if that'll will get us closer to a cure. I'm also personally disgusted by far people and smokers, but I don't go up to their face and say it to them.

Really? Who? Althusser, Foucault, Barthes, Derrida and Baumann would challenge that. Pretty much all of the post-modern crowd would.


And if you refer to PhilPapers study, to someone who argues for objectivity, if you look at the demographics of that study, you will note that certain fields (Philosophy of Mind, Metaphysics, and Normative Ethic) are highly represented while fields of study leaning towards a more post-modern approach such as 20th Century Philosophy, Philosophy of Gender, Race, and Sexuality, and Africana Philsophy are underrepresented. Similarly, the United States is also highly overrepresented.


So, basically, you can argue that in the United States male philosophers mostly in the fields of Philosophy of Mind, Metaphysics, and Normative Ethic agree that there is such a thing as ""objective reality"". Or: Of 931 philosophers 525 lean more towards or accept moral realism over moral anti-realism.


Question now is: Does this really represent the consensus in the philosophical field of morality, as in their writing and predominant theories? Or does it only represent a representative 56% of 931 philosophers interviewed by PhilPapers in 2009?

0,1,Singing_Shibboleth,t5_2qh13,"&gt;  Retirement ages have been rolled back and taxes have gone up.

Syriza reversed that, and with what mechanism when property ownership isn't currently recorded in Greece - so how can you tax on property if you don't know who owns it.

&gt; but measures have been put in place to counteract that

Measures have been promised, not enacted.  As we have seen, Syriza promises a lot of things.  Note that the measures you list a) were enacted by the previous administration, and even then, b) they have declined outside help to bolster the effectiveness of their tax collection system, and c) ""pay your taxes or we'll put your name on a list"" doesn't seem all that effective as a deterrent.  Freezing their assets and seizing their accounts would be.

&gt; What Europe needs to do if it wants Greece to stay (which it should otherwise the Euro will fall), is to forgive and/or extend loan deadlines.

A) the euro won't fail, as greece is a speed bump at 2% of the EU's GDP, B) They've already had 50% forgiveness back in 2012.  Maybe the greeks shouldn't have wasted the chance they had then, and C) I'd add establish financial regulations preventing the issuing of any private/business loan to individuals where debt service exceeds 30% of their income.   This would prevent the prevalent pattern of business owners claiming that loan servicing is consuming 80% of their income (e.g. underreporting income to evade tax, but getting loans anyway).

Nobody considers it controversial with dog breeds, but it's taboo with humans.

Just as very few Chihuahuas have the intelligence to be drug-sniffing dogs (which many German Shepherds are used as).

With that said, the fact that the Middle East has a lower average IQ than Europe is not sufficient to explain the lack of scientists.

0,2,Grine_,t5_2rd6n,"Mmmmm, forgive me, but I'm a bit skeptical of this. Before I begin, I don't claim expert status here.

First of all, the term ""Dark Ages"" is a bit of a misnomer. They were once considered ""dark"" because we didn't know much of what went on in Europe at the time, owing to a relative lack of sources. Valid observation, but as far as I know the name hasn't stuck in historians' circles. It's also worth noting that the rest of the world didn't experience the same changes as Europe, or the collapse of Rome -- and yet there were no Ottoman or Chinese airplanes in 1700, either.

I'm also quite skeptical of your idea of ""advancement"". After all, scientific advancement is clearly not linear or uncomplicated. Take astronomy, for instance: Ptolemy's [*Almagest*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest) was a remarkable mathematical achievement, and plotted the positions of the planets quite accurately. However, he released it as a companion to his [*Tetrabiblos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrabiblos), which was about how you could use those positions in astrology. While we recognize that as hogwash today, Ptolemy wasn't alone in his time.

The same goes for technologies. It's unsophisticated and inaccurate to think of technological advancement as linear; it's much more productive to think of technologies as manifestations of human intention. For example, while [a steam engine was probably developed in the ancient world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria#Inventions), we obviously didn't revisit this sort of thing until later, when there were strong economic reasons to. And while a lot of ancient inventions like Hero's engine may have been ""lost"", the Middle Ages also saw [innovations of their own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_technology).",t1_csoy2ao,t3_3br675,0,,Scatterverse / Hard-SF Space Opera,,2,False,,1437497706,worldbuilding,False,False,0,1435774473,t1_csox4ai,csoy2ao

0,0,Panzerdrek,t5_2vva3,"A single example of invasiveness is not proof of a thing being ""the most invasive."" It is a piece of evidence towards that claim, but it is far from being sufficient to establish that claim. 

Also, in many other developed countries this kind of spying not only exists, but is in fact completely legal. In the U.K. for example, they have CCTV that monitors nearly every minute of every day of people's activities in public spaces. [France recently approved a sweeping domestic surveillance bill](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/world/europe/french-legislators-approve-sweeping-intelligence-bill.html?_r=0), pretty much of the same scope as the NSA spying in the U.S., with the key distinction that *it is about to be legally codified by their own legislature*. In general, European spy agencies have been [cooperating in similar domestic spying activitiesd](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/11/2/report-europe-spyagenciesworkedtogetheronnsastylemasssurveillanc.html). So the belief that what the U.S did was completely unique is misplaced. The main difference is just the sheer amount of money that the U.S. pumps in to the NSA, and that is mostly just because the US has such a massive economy and a large budget set aside for such programs. 

In general, the U.S. has stronger protections for privacy rights and in particular for due process rights than many European countries. Certainly since 9/11, spy agencies have really pushed the boundaries of what is legal, but that problem isn't really restricted to the U.S. and we have the benefit of Constitutionally enshrined civil protections that don't exist in many other countries.  While it is fair to say a lot of those protections have been eroded at the margins, it is simply wild exaggeration to call the state of affairs totalitarian. We still have strong individual civil rights as citizens that provide us due process and which protect us from the state, and those rights are regularly upheld in the courts despite opposition from the government. That would never happen in a totalitarian state.

0,5,[deleted],t5_2ssp3,"I actually do Viking Age live-steel fighting and have heard many arguments about what the ""real"" style of fighting was.

To start: There is not going to have a lot of good/solid answers between the Fall of Rome (in the Northern European regions this time period was called the Migration Period) and Early Middle Ages because there is not a ton of real textual evidence for how fighting was truly done with a shield and some type of hand weapon (axe, seax, sword) and the textual evidence we do have are through the sagas which are questionable since they were written down much later after the Viking Age. 

Most of what you are finding is based off of interpretations of later Middle Age Sword Fechtbücher. In the video the guys are trained in fighting from the sword-fighting treatises I mentioned and are using logical interpretation to try and re-imagine how fighting one-on-one would have happened (as opposed to battle fights where the dynamics are different). But as one Viking Age fighting scholar, William Short, mentions on his [site](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/text/viking_arms_intro.htm) and what has been said to by him to my fighting friends: you can't entirely trust the Fechtbücher as they were written during a different context of warfare and fighting.  On the other hand, Short depends a lot on the sagas as a source for his training videos and fighting instruction as well as for his book ""Viking Weapons and Combat Techniques"" which as I mentioned before risks telling fighting techniques that may also be out of context of the period.

All this said, fighting techniques without the infrastructure of writings and particular teachers would mean that styles could vary from area to even personal style meaning that there may be truths to what is said in the video and even what William Short teaches because in the end, fighting doesn't change too much.  I know I watched the above video and it greatly improved how I fought in our groups demonstration holmgangs but also left out that some of the techniques they used expects that you are a righty fighting a righty (or lefty v. lefty) which is rarely the case thus styles and tactics need to change somewhat.

In terms of fighting in bigger battles, the use of the shield-wall and boar-snout are solidly evidenced.  Essentially the shield-wall was made by creating a front line that had close-formation with shield over-lapping each other as to lock the wall. The strategy was to make openings with the hooked bottoms of [bearded](http://casiberia.com/img/prod/xh1073n.jpg) or [dane-axes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Dane_Axe.JPG) pulling open the wall so other fighters behind the shield-wall and begin stabbing into the opening with their spears (spears were the most common weapon, swords were the rarest). The point was to make wide openings in the wall to divide the line as to begin creating panic and thus turn the battle into one-on-one engagements.  The (boar-snout)[http://www.vikingsonline.org.uk/images/wedge.jpg] was a good formation for creating a point to move in towards dividing a shield-wall but ran the risk of becoming open to flanking since the line narrows to create the point.

I have a manual for fighting for the UK reenactment group The Vikings which is strict about reenactment members adhering closely to what is believed to actually exist to the period as far as we know now but it is not something I want to upload and post on an open forum thus I could email it to you if you send a PM with your email address. Also while there are criticisms to William Short's research methodology for fighting, it is still the best we have considering the lack of resources for that period.",t1_csoycsk,t3_3br2j8,0,,,,5,False,,1437497779,AskHistorians,False,False,0,1435774892,t3_3br2j8,csoycsk

0,2,TheByzantineDragon,t5_37yqr,"Meneer de Voorzitter,

De heer bigbramel moet geen aannames doen voordat hij begint te spreken. Ik doelde namelijk op Zweden en Ierland, die eerder Palestina hebben erkend en hier geen nadelen binnen Westerse bondgenootschappen hebben ondervonden, slechts onsmakelijke tweets van de Israëlische ambassades in de respectievelijke landen.

Ook het parlement van het Verenigd Koninkrijk heeft,  net als  meerdere parlementen, gezegd dat het Palestina onofficieel erkend, maar hebben toegegeven dit nog niet te doen om EU politicus Frederic Mogherini de kans te geven om het vredesprocess verder te helpen. Het kabinet, net zoals Zweden, Ierland en de overige 133 landen, is van mening dat hoe hard mevrouw Mogherini het ook probeert, een vredesprocess zal pas slagen als de landen op beide voeten gelijk erkend zijn.

Daarnaast heeft het feit dat de Oostbloklanden Palestina erkend hebben, geen negatieve invloed gehad op hun toetreding tot de NAVO en de EU, ook al was het pro-Palestina sentiment toentertijd veel lager. Dat gecombineerd met het feit dat vrijwel heel Europa onofficieel Palestina al erkend, denk ik dat de heer bigbramel spoken ziet.

Israël had inderdaad kernwapens, terwijl Iran ze nog niet had/heeft. Maar Israël heeft ook nooit actief met ze gedreigd als Palestina erkend wordt. Iran heeft wel zeer actief gedreigd en het Westen was overtuigd dat Iran bezig was op kernwapens te ontwikkelen. Ik vind het hoogst eigenaardig dat de heer bigbramel bang is om een land, dat kernwapens heeft maar er niet mee dreigt, op de teentjes te trappen, terwijl hij blijkbaar denkt dat het gewoon is voor het Westen om Iran, een land waarvan het Westen zelf denkt dat het kernwapens wil produceren en er ook actief mee dreigt, wel een harde trap op de tenen te geven.

Moet ik nu aannemen dat de heer Bigbramel de sancties had geprobeerd tegen te houden toen het Westen deze implementeerde op basis van het vermoeden dat het land kernwapens probeerde te ontwikkelen? Ik geloof daar persoonlijk, gezien de VVD's standpunt tegen de erkenning van een land dat slachtoffer is van schendingen van het internationaal recht, helemaal niks van.

Israël heeft namelijk inderdaad laten zien dat het oorlogswetten schendt, zoals de heer Bigbramel zelf zegt. 

Des te vreemder vind ik het dat de heer bigbramel hier het slachtoffer van die schendingen een extra steek in de rug geeft, door Palestina's beste kans om deze schendingen tegen te gaan verder te vertragen.

Des te afschuwelijker ik het vind dat de VVD totaal serieus het belang van onze economie eerder aanhaalde, om Palestina niet te erkennen. Blijkbaar vind de VVD een klein aspect (want laten we eerlijk zijn, Israël heeft geen enorm groot aandeel in de Nederlandse economie) van de economie, belangrijker dan internationaal recht.

Meneer de voorzitter, nou kan de VVD zeggen dat het vindt dat de erkenning niet nodig is om Palestina te helpen tegen deze schendingen en om vrede te bereiken. Maar als ze dat doen wil ik graag dat ze dan ook argumenteren wáárom ze denken dat een land dat op gelijke voet staat met z'n vijand niet een grotere kans heeft om die vijand tegen te houden.

Elke logica en onderzoek wijst er namelijk op dat facties, die beide op zelfde voet staan en die beide bereidt zijn om concessies te doen, een grotere kans hebben op langdurige vrede. In Afrikaanse burgeroorlogen gedurende de 20e eeuw is opgemerkt dat burgeroorlogen minder vaak opnieuw uitbraken als beide facties, zowel winnaar als verliezer, bereidt waren de ander tegemoet te komen.

En nu de heer Bigbramel het toch over de modelwereld heeft, zou ik hem graag via de voorzitter erop willen attenderen dat zelfs de Britten hier in modelwereld Palestina al erkend hebben. Een feit dat mijn idee, dat de heer Bigbramel problemen ziet waar ze niet zijn, nog meer versterkt.",t1_csoyfz5,t3_3br0ko,0,gl,GL | Vice-Voorzitter | Minister OCW,,2,False,,1437497823,RMTK,False,1435775773,0,1435775016,t1_csow88e,csoyfz5

0,36,migMAN_3,t5_2t7no,"Thanks. I try to stay educated on the matter of Russian politics, which sheds quite a bit of light on the current situation. Our current skin-deep level of political discourse in America has been ignoring the sophisticated threat that is forming in the Balkan and Black Sea regions. 

However hard to admit, the scenario of open or proxy war with Russia is increasing: http://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8845913/russia-war

I will be the first to say there are issues with the above article, especially how eager the author is to tie our current scenario to WWI. However, it is apropos to understand what we've signed up for. By even being *aware* of the existence of Article 5, you are eons ahead of most Americans, so I'll let you form your own opinion about the likelihood of war. 

What I will say with confidence is this: If a qualifying Article 5 event occurs, and is recognized, shit will get very bad for people living in the previously mentioned regions. I really feel bad for them, and I think about this daily. Through no fault of their own, these people have not had access to the resources needed to be truly independent, and both the East and West spit on their humanity by treating their land as a rope toy to play tug-o-war with. 

Europe, on paper at least, has the manpower and tech to counter a traditional Russian attack as outlined in any late 80s or early 90s land war scenario. All those tactical nukes we were afraid of have to be delivered by aircraft, which for the most part will not make great headway against modern defense infrastructure. As the article I share above mentions, however, Putin can offset his lack of manpower and modern tech by fomenting horrid social strife and removing the society we want to fight for in the first place. Again, I leave it up to you to decide whether or not there is enough evidence in the news to ascribe to this notion.

TL; DR: I fear the real damage from a conflict triggered by Article 5 will be felt by the people of the former Soviet Republics. It seems that no one is willing to defend their cause out of principle, but rather they will be absolutely flattened under the combined weight of the East and West as we decide how best to exploit them. Shameful.

It seems to me a tactic to create a possibility to save German companies at the risk of foreign takeover by shifting cash from a German interest in a hidden manner to take over the threatened Germany company before a hypothetical foreign corporation could, while in the EU, Germany prevents other states from exercising such protectionism. For example climategate exposed an anti-competitive German plan to use structures like the Kyoto protocol to hamper the competitors of German industry like the USA and Japan by trying to get the rest of the world to commit to fixing their carbon output to 1990 levels. Which coincides with the time German reunification saw that part of Germany decrease greenhouse levels by 40+% cent in that part of Germany as polluting coal based industry there was transitioned to cleaner oil and natural gas, so Kyoto if ratified according to German wishes would have meant no real adjustment for German industry, but a heavy price for its competitors:

0,3,[deleted],t5_2qh13,"&gt; Why should they bother trying to repay massive debts if the IMF itself thinks that they'll still be in the shitter in 15 years??

The IMF report is heavily political just like a report by the UN would be. If you recall the OSCE monitors in Ukraine being unable to say that Russians were there, they could only say the dry ""we have observed"" because of politics. This isn't all that much different. The report covers the hypothetical of ""If they implement these guidelines with no additional structural reforms, what happens?"" and they get a report showing what happens.

To some, the report is an instant repudiation of the policies, IMF, EU, and everybody else. To others, it is simply a statement saying that the measures are not enough and deeper reforms are necessary to put Greece back on the correct path. The difference is what happens next as a result of the report and the rapidly widening gulf between Greece and their creditors.

&gt; They need to make the social-payment adjustments regardless, so why shouldn't they just say ""fuck it"" to the EU and default?

The debt they owe the IMF/EU is denominated in Euros as is a significant portion of private debt owed to banks in the EU. For an example, your home in Athens could have a loan denominated in Euros with a bank in Italy. If you look at what happened when the Swiss removed the currency peg with the Euro, the loans denominated in a different currency rapidly became more expensive to pay off. The exchange rate from drachmas to euros will take a **very** long time to improve so you won't be able to afford your mortgage.

As private debt defaults climb, banks will close unable to handle the losses or obtain loans themselves, businesses will close due to a lack of demand and high cost of borrowing, and the spiral continues. It is also important to remember that defaulting on the international debt does not in any way mean they don't owe it. It will just be a lot harder to pay back.

Why should they care? If Greece ever wants to borrow money again, the funds will have to be paid back in full. There is no sovereign bankruptcy for a country. 

&gt; You are not providing **any** compelling reasons for Greece to ""suck it up"".

It could be worse doesn't seem like a very good reason. It is though. The problems so far would be absolutely nothing compared to the financial hellscape of a return to the drachma without proper planning. If you want a look at it, look at the changeover in Crimeia and imagine a first world economy completely changing currencies all in one day from a valuable currency to one that no one on the international market wants. The exchange rate is going to be brutal and combined with the rest of the defaults, lack of access to loans, and economic fallout, it has the potential to set Greece back decades. 

&gt; Newsflash: Greece will become a more desirable tourist destination and shipping area when the Euro buys more Drachmas.

Newsflash: Greece imports energy, medicine, and manufactured goods. It produces tourism, agricultural goods, and lacks a diversified economy.

The new currency will make it vastly more expensive to import what they need from other countries.

&gt; Provide verifiable stats that this phenomenon is anywhere near the numbers of the traditional, male dominated sex tourism industry.

*Where did I even insinuate that?* I hope you're good enough with numbers to recognize that there's a lot of wiggle room between ~0% and 50%.

But yeah, female sex tourism is bound to be considerably lower than male sex tourism since your average woman will have a pretty good shot at having sex above her league if she's inclined to do so without travelling to countries far away; and get it without having to pay. But at some point (age, being overweight, having kids) getting sex and the mere illusion of romance from an attractive man is off the table, and that's where female sex-tourism grows.

&gt;verifiable stats

About that... [good luck with that:](http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life/ladies-your-holiday-romance-awaits-20130207-2dymx.html)

&gt;Female sex holidays are not a new phenomenon. In recent years the industry has grown in popularity, although the subject is still very much taboo and has provoked ongoing debate between filmmakers, writers and researchers. **Due to its secrecy, there are no reliable figures showing how many women have taken part in sex tourism since the 1980s,** but according to Reuters, approximately 80,000 North American and European romance-seeking women travel to Jamaica every year.

80k a year in Jamaica alone is a pretty decent amount for a country with less than 3 million inhabitants.

But I see where you're getting at - the mere existence of female sex tourism is already a challenge for the feminist assumption of women as better human beings. Or, to quote the best known feminist magazine in Germany ([translation courtesy of myself](http://www.emma.de/artikel/paradies-liebe-wenn-frauen-maenner-bezahlen-266200)), where the hypocrisy of that ideology is almost tangible:

&gt;**Paradise: Love - When women pay men**
&gt;
&gt;*Things aren't interchangeable after all. If men buy women, they want power - if women buy men, they're looking for love. The Austrian director Ulrich Seidl has already made several intense movies about the reality of prostitution, like ""Hundstage"" or ""Import-Export"". Now he approaches the inverse constellation.*
&gt;
&gt;His protagonist, viennese woman Teresa, early 50s, single mother - acted depressingly convincing by Margarethe Tiesel - goes on a vacation to Kenya. There she realizes that she can pay men for doing ""grabby grabby"". Pay. But not buy. Desire isn't for sale. Regardless which gender the payed person has. But women have learned to feign desire. Men never needed to do the same. Even if they're poor sods like those blacks who have to prosititute themselves for white women. These bought men despise their female buyers for that. Bought women are despised by their male buyers. 

Bullet dodged, girls! If men buy sex, men are the bad guys! If women buy sex... surprise! Men are the bad guys, too! 

And judging from your comment (it even has a gratuitous reference to child prostitution for additional indignation points!) ...

&gt;Provide any data that demonstrates women are visiting countries with rampant trafficking to - let's not put too fine a point on it - rape underage girls as young as 6.

...I am under the impression that you're feeling pretty much the same.

It fails to mention important joint projects like the EPR, where Siemens was heavily involved. Siemens decided to quit the nuclear technology development, while France decided to do not and now suffers even more of the financial losses, since the EPR projects is generating more and more financial problems.

There are some Areva activities on the German market, both nuclear and renewable.

But most important it fails to describe how such a 'team up' will look like. How would the German public view a team-up with French state-owned nuclear industry while at the same time everything is done to reduce nuclear power in Germany, with huge financial impact?

&gt; and the Germans scaled back their feed-in tariffs drastically last year.

Some. Germany did not scale back on renewable energy in general. 2014 and 2015 a lot of new capacity is coming online.

&gt; The ultimate goal is to get rid of fossil fuels

The German goal is to get rid of nuclear first and then fossil fuels. Getting rid of nuclear takes two decades. The main goal though, is to replace the old energy system (huge monopolistic utility companies providing nuclear and fossil fuel based electricity production) with a new renewable based one - market oriented, distributed and decentralized. The first goal of a power plant is not to reduce something, the first goal is to provide electricity in a safe and reliable way. Here with a fully new system which needs several decades to build up. Sure, France would like to sell electricity from their state-owned power plants on a liberalized German market. There really is a clash of systems and it takes more than wishful thinking to make them cooperate in a useful way. Then there is the EU who favors opening the local markets and the creation of a larger European market. That's another ongoing process. Germany is not opposed to work together with France, but helping them to keep their outdated state-owned system is not a German focus.

Unfortunately, the article does not give a hint how that 'team up' thing can look like.

The reason the ages of the character were chafed were because the show runners really wanted Dinklage and Bean.

At least, I am not aware of any clear legal basis for such a right and I think for such a right to exist it would need to be explicit.

Separately, even if such a complainant were able to win this kind of case against the Greek state, I'm not sure why they would bother trying, given their legal costs. How would they enforce their right? The kind of Greek state that happily defaults against the IMF is just going to add this obligation to its growing list of other unpaid debts.

There is no legal mechanism for Greece to create a new currency within the EU, but it does not follow from this (as a matter of law) that if it does it has to leave the EU. It will just create a new currency in breach of the law.

0,1,Kyle_Pq,t5_2tjcr,"Então - o FX 6300 é um processador bem medíocre, e fazer overclock poderia melhorar sua performance em algo em torno de 15%, o que não é suficiente para ser tão bom quanto um i3. 
  
Ademais, overclock exige custos tanto em uma boa placa mãe quanto em um bom cooler, com os quais você poderia, em vez disso, comprar um processador melhor (como um i3, e, principalmente, um i5) sem precisar de um overclock, e cuja um processador AMD na faixa de preço não poderia alcançar sequer com overclock. Por isso, comprar um processador AMD para jogar acaba sendo um *ruim* custo-benefício.  
  
O mito de que AMD tem o melhor ""custo-benefício"" não é de todo errado, mas bastante incompleto -- se for considerar a performance que o processador em termos de uso de todos os núcleos, sim, são os processadores de melhor CxB. Porém, essa afirmação cai por terra quando compara-se com a perfomance por núcleo, que é baixa em processadores AMD e *crucial* para a esmagadora maioria dos jogos atuais (isso mudará em alguns anos, mas não por enquanto). 
  
Nesse [benchmark](http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/cpu/display/fx-8350-8320-6300-4300_6.html#sect0), você pode ver que o i3 chega a superar o FX-8320 (imagine o FX-6300!) em jogos que precisam muito de performance por núcleo, que são a maioria atualmente. A seleção de jogos desse artigo possui jogos bem otimizados para múltiplos núcleos, por isso a performance entre ambos se mostra equilibrada. Mas, como eu disse, a esmagadora maioria dos jogos não é assim bem otimizada.  
  
Quanto à sua placa mãe, digo que não é um bom custo benefício.

0,2,Dark_Ethereal,t5_2sokd,"Greece borrowed the money. It is obligated to pay it back, but it has borrowed far too much and cannot afford to make the repayments and run it's country.

Everyone else who lends money knows that Greece is not a safe place to lend your money to any more, so they won't lend money at anything less than extortionate interest rates.

The IMF and the European Central Bank are the only people still prepared to lend money to Greece at rates it could actually hope to repay, money which it needs to pay keep it's head above the water, but they won't do it unless Greece is prepared to restructure how it runs it's self so it stops spending money on things that it cannot afford to pay. If they don't make the changes then they cannot be assured that they are going to get the money back and that greece isn't going to fail anyway. 
The changes they are demanding are to ensure Greece an actually keep operating.

The alternative for Greece is to not meet the demands, and not take the money. Greece is free to do that, but if it does, it WILL continue to default and may have to declare bankruptcy.

If they declare Bankruptcy, nobody will loan to them for a very long time.
Nobody is going to invade them and extract the debt by force. Nobody can force them to pay, but if they cannot pay, nobody will ever lend to them because there's no incentive to do so, since they have a history of not repaying debts.

There are only two options available. Agree to get another bailout loan to pay the debts, or don't pay the debts.

If we just agree that they don't have to pay the debts, it's just the same as them not repaying the debts, because creditors would know that whether through refusal or agreement, Greece did not pay it's debts.

Yes, Greece may be caught between a rock and a hard place, but their government played fast and loose with their economy and lost. They had a retirement age of 50!

You can't just pay for everything with debt. Shit happens eventually. The Greek government let shit happen.

I think the terminology is important, personally. Calling the persecution of the Jews ""racism"" projects a modern idea onto people who would neither understand nor accept it. The idea of ""race"" has a certain historical and political baggage that medieval Europeans just didn't carry, even if some aspects of their behavior resembled said baggage.

People definitely suffered oppression and discrimination based on broad categories prior to the early modern invention of race. There's no denying this.

That's good if you have DeGaulle or Suez, or don't have Europe Scoring.  If you don't have DeGaulle or Suez, or do have Europe Scoring, then I'd start 3 WG, 2 IT, 2 FR--you take immediate dominance of Europe and can fend off any Soviet attempt to equal in total country count because you'll place 1 in SP, GR, and TU with Marshall.

Just because someone doesn't have an obvious, logical connection to a team (like geographic proximity) doesn't necessarily mean their love and support for a club is any less.

It's hard to say that is inherently much different than living in England and being raised supporting a certain team (just because you can't make it down to the stadium). 

I think the reason you find foreigners (lets use us Americans for sake of conversation) supporting the big, successful clubs is because of access. When I got interested in soccer when I was much younger, there were only a handful of club soccer games broadcast on TV where I lived (the internet didn't really exist at this point, at least to the extent it does now). Unsurprisingly, the games broadcast were the ""big"" games, generally containing the top teams playing in CL. It is through this exposure that people find themselves supporting a team. I mean, no one is going to watch only games involving Real Madrid growing up and then find themselves being a Watford fan. It just doesn't make sense.

Those fields are part of equal opportunities, are optional and aren't shared with the interviewer (not supposed to be anyway). There is a ""Rather not say"" option on each of the questions and you're under no obligation to fill it in. If they demand you choose something other than ""rather not say"" they're breaking the law and you can take legal action against them, and you will win.

&gt; to meet some sort of divergence criteria

The Equal Rights act in draconian fashion dictates a percentage of your work force must be of a diverse origin. I'm not an employment lawyer and it's not my job to check the ethinicity or disability of my clients, but I recall a 2% figure floating about somewhere. You can be fined for not adhering to the equal rights act and those forms form part of saying ""Hey look, we're compliant"" to anyone who might want to inspect. They're nothing to do with the hiring process.

&gt; why would someone with a clear 'lack'(one that I imagine isn't on the same proficiency as born UK candidates)of the english languange be hired 'first'?

When I first began in recruitment, it was sort of at the bottom, not quite as I had experience in other sectors, but it was the bottom none the less. I recruited mass candidates for very low end jobs, warehouse needs 70 people to seal some boxes on a production line, I'd recruit 70 people to seal some boxes on a production line. A factory wants 50 people to make sandwiches on a production line, well you see the drill. The strong majority of candidates recruited (easily over 90% I'd say) were foreign born, and I imagine still are.

Just to make things clear, this is before the client has even seen some CV's (if for these jobs they even want CV's), the applicants I would be getting just weren't from British Nationals, minimum wage, 10-20 hours a week no guarantee the work will be there day to day. British people just didn't apply. Had nothing to do with the client, if barely any apply, how can I forward on their applications?

As I moved on the balance changed, I began hiring help desk IT roles with 1st and 2nd line support experience, some Unix administrators/Red Hat and Windows Server support. Whether the applicants were foreign born or not seemed to just depend on the area of the country the job was located. The clients always favoured people British born (I only sent CV's of people with the experience so all candidates were at similar levels) after interview. Excellent communication skills and being able to resolve issues and explain in an easy to understand way were key, and if they didn't have this because they didn't speak English well, they weren't hired.

Now I'm as far as you can go in IT and the applicants are more foreign born again. Any reason? There just aren't enough Brits with the skills to fill all the roles, I read somewhere we need 100,000 more people with IT skills to meet demand, and I couldn't agree more from what I've seen. If you can't fill a role at home, you seek candidates from afar, so there are a lot from the EU and India.

Financial experts in New York, London, and Brussels have tut-tutted Greece’s economic travails as Athens considers its future with the European Union. Why did they borrow so much money? How can they ever pay it back? Do they think that much debt is sustainable?

Instead of pointing fingers at the innumerates running Athens, they should consider our own situation. Jason Russell of the Washington Examiner shows how America’s debt projections look suspiciously like Greece’s recent history.

With all the chaos unravelling in Greece, Congress would be wise to do what it takes to avoid reaching Greek debt levels. But it’s not a matter of sticking to the status quo and avoiding bad decisions that would put the budget on a Greek-like path, because the budget is on that path already.

A quarter-century ago, Greek debt levels were roughly 75 percent of Greece’s economy — about equal to what the U.S. has now. As of 2014, Greek debt levels are about 177 percent of national GDP. Now, the country is considering defaulting on its loans and uncertainty is gripping the economy.

In 25 years, U.S. debt levels are projected to reach 156 percent of the economy, which Greece had in 2012. That projection comes from the Congressional Budget Office’s alternative scenario, which is more realistic than its standard fiscal projection about which spending programs Congress will extend into the future.

If Congress leaves the federal budget on autopilot, debt levels will soar. Instead, spending must be reined in to avoid a Greek-style meltdown.

While we’re right to be concerned about 2040, the U.S. is in deep trouble now. Yet if you mention the debt to most Americans, they’re either confused or indifferent. “But Obama lowered the deficit.” “Just print more money.“ “It’s Reagan’s fault!”

Since most graphs look like this, I created my own user-friendly debt chart focused on three big numbers: Deficit, revenue and debt. (My first version was published a couple of years ago. This one is updated with the most recent figures).

It’s an imperfect analogy, but imagine the green is your salary, the yellow is the amount you’re spending over your salary, and the red is your MasterCard statement.

The chart is brutally bipartisan. Debt increased under Republican presidents and Democrat presidents. It increased under Democrat congresses and Republican congresses. In war and in peace, in boom times and in busts, after tax hikes and tax cuts, the Potomac flowed ever deeper with red ink.

Our leaders like to talk about sustainability. Forget sustainable — how is this sane?

Yet when a conservative hesitates before increasing spending, he’s portrayed as a madman. When a Republican offers a thoughtful plan to reduce the debt over decades, he’s pushing grannies into the Grand Canyon and pantsing park rangers on the way out. While the press occasionally griped about spending under Bush, they implore Obama to spend even more.

When I posted the earlier version of this chart, the online reaction was intense. A few on the right thought I was too tough on the GOP while those on the left claimed it didn’t matter or it’s all a big lie. Others told me that I should have weighted for this variable or added lines for that trend. They are free to create their own charts to better fit their narrative and I’m sure they will. But the numbers shown above can’t be spun by either side.

All of the figures come from the U.S. Treasury and math doesn’t care about fairness or good intentions. Spending vastly more than you have, decade after decade, is foolish when done by a Republican or a Democrat. Two plus two doesn’t equal 33.2317 after you factor in a secret “Social Justice” multiplier.

If our current president accumulates debt at the rate of his first six-plus years, the national debt will be nearly $20 trillion by the time leaves office. That is almost double what it was when he was first inaugurated.

Like many Americans, I haven’t had the privilege of visiting Greece. Unfortunately, Greece will be visiting us unless we change things and fast.

1.European Turkey (Trakya) - The 

place where people are obsest with 

Rakı (fuck rakija) and Oil wrestling. 

And they can't pronounce the H's (no 

baguette) and finish their sentences 

with the word ""bea"" pronounced bey-

AH, funny people. (I am aslo a 

Thracian but not from Turkish Thrace 

[like you care]).

2.Istanbul aka Protestinopolis aka 

Center of the Universe. You already 

know about it.

3.To west. Marmara - place where most 

couples go on honneymoon.

4.A little bit down. Ege - The most 

europeanic and secular part of 

Turkey. Everyone hates Erdoğan and 

supports CHP. There are old grandmas 

who always gossip about everyone. For 

some reason they use olive oil with 

everything. Their favourite word: 

gari, rponounced GAH-ree. Also the 

Soma accident.

5.Turn to right. Antalya - The land 

of the sexiest tourists and the 

playboys with awful pick up lines. 

And up there, it's Konya - probably 

the countries' most religous place. 

Not that the women actually wear 

burkas it's just for the comic.

6.Adana - Adanalıyık, Allahın 

adamıyık koçum! The origin of the 

magnificent kebab, full of syrians 

and turanists. Most of the people 

support MHP.

7.South Eastearn Anatolia. BIJI HEWAL KUZI KERI 

8.Going up. Karadeniz. Funny fishers 

with dumb jokes. Love eating hamsi. 

Their favourite words: Uy da (ooy 

dah) NOT SLAVIC. Also Rize, where the 

bestest of best tea comes (fuc u 

britain)

9.Samsun. Turkey's Texas. All of the 

weird shit happens there.

10.Down again. Anadolu. AKP 

supporters, baklava, neo-ottomanists, 

Eskişehir, which is always between 

AKP and CHP and our tratidional

I was sitting in one of the business class lounges in the Hong Kong airport while waiting for my flight, when I had the strong feeling that I was being watched. I looked around and noticed an attractive woman staring at me. I had caught her staring, and she looked away quickly. She eventually turned back to me, and smiled. I smiled back, but since I was just married (and happily so), I did not get up to have a conversation. Instead, I read my book and occasionally looked in her direction. Every time I looked at her, she was looking at me. It was simultaneously flattering and creepy. 

My flight was called, and I boarded the plane to Tokyo. This was a Saturday morning, and by the time I arrived at my hotel it was late Saturday evening. On Sunday morning, some coworkers of mine from Tokyo met me at the hotel in order to take me around sight-seeing. We went ALL over Tokyo--we hit Akihabara, visited some of the open air markets, checked out temples, ate some fantastic Sushi for lunch, gawked at the mass of humanity in Shibuya, and generally did everything they could recommend as ""must do"". 

At the end of the day, just as it was getting dark, we hit the subway to go back to my hotel. I sat down on one of the benches and grabbed a pole to hang on. As I looked up, the hair on the back of my neck rose as I watched THAT VERY WOMAN from the Hong Kong airport walk onto the train and sit down right next to me. She was with two Japanese friends, both female. She turned to me with an expression of surprise on her face.  I looked back at her in utter shock. I said, ""What are the odds of seeing you again?!""  She spoke with an Eastern Europe accent, saying, ""Oh, I would love to see you again, where are you staying?""

At this point, I was very confused, and then realized my statement could be taken more than one way. It sounded like I was propositioning her, and my coworkers (who knew I had just recently married) were looking at me and at her with suspicion. I could hear their thoughts...is he really trying to hit on some lady in the subway? 

The rest of the interaction is something of a blur. She told me she was an exchange student from Poland, and was staying with a host family. She insisted on meeting me at a certain train stop the next day, and shortly thereafter she and her friends departed. I went back to my hotel and boggled over the whole thing. I did not meet her the next day.  I finished out my business in Tokyo and departed a few days later.

The US is much worse, they sent weapons directly and they ended up right in the hands of rebel fighters, no credible sources but how else do you explain modern US weapons in their hands?

0,4,iTomes,t5_2qh4j,"&gt; A more pragmatic way of thinking, that is spreaded widely especially in the anglo-worls (therefore especially the british/us-economist sayin it..) is that every government spending is also the income of a citizen who will spend more money himself and so on... so that the government can create demand and should make debts for that... as you can't make debts forever, the common sense is to act anticyclic and spend in time of crisis and to cut the spending programs when a boom is there.

This is how it is done on a very wide scale and how most nations averted the crisis. However, applying these measures actually requires the necessary funds to do so, hence, as you stated, it is applied in an anti-cyclical fashion. The issue with Greece is that it basically ran economic crisis/depression deficit spending during boom phases.

Basically, if Greece started heavy spending to fix their economic crisis their debt would escalate to the point where they would no longer be able to service it, in turn forcing a default and in doing so ruining whatever economic stimulus their spending provided and then some, making it an exercise in futility. As such Greece can not engage in such spending unless it is paid for by others.

This is ultimately at the heart of the issue: Greece wants to employ deficit spending, however, to do so they need monetary transfers (directly or indirectly) from the rest of the EU. However, the latter is not a transfer union and none of its member states desire it to become a proper one right now.

0,1,[deleted],t5_2y2sm,"&gt;What benefit do I get from maintaining a relationship with this woman that could possibly outweigh the risks?

How much time, on the average, do you spend maintaining those plates, including getting them, maintaining game, and so on? Because unless you are overflowing with money and have a chiseled body with a tan and a European accent, you still have to put in effort in to getting plates - going out, text game, arranging meetups and so on. 

Now consider that some guys, between all the self improvement shit that they are doing, simply don't have the time or energy to do this. Try working in a demanding career with 60 hour weeks (which is usually the high paying ones), but still wanting to do personal hobbies, as well as gym, and you will find that your free time to go out and work on plates is limited. 

In this case, having an LTR is often the preferred option, as you don't have to go out of your way to keep getting sex. 

Also, LTRs do not imply a track to marriage. Nobody is saying you have to sign papers or move in with the girl and split rent, or share finances in an LTR in preparation. LTRS are simply a transnational exchange of you not going for other girls in return of you getting sex and other benefits without putting in much effort. And if the girl breaks this transaction and stops giving you the sex you need, you don't have to do anything special, you just break it off and move on, since you did everything correctly. 

Also, some guys want kids and in this case you absolutely have to start working on an LTR and eventually get married.

In fact until the 1970s, if US parents wanted to subject a daughter to clitoridectomy (i.e., female genital mutilation), it was only a matter of finding a willing doctor. Here is one woman's story of her [US medical female genital mutilation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx3nGs7mQug) (13 min). Involuntary clitoridectomy like this grew unpopular by the 1980s but it was not criminalized until 1996. And (legal) voluntary adult female genital cutting, a popular trend in the 1970s, was not rebuked by any US medical organization until 2007 ([Rodriguez, 2014](http://books.google.com/books?id=-PMwBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;pg=PA124)). 

In 2010, the AAP actually recommended taking a step backwards in the fight against female genital cutting by recommending doctors perform non-excisive female genital cutting in order to placate parents who would prefer riskier and more severe surgeries. Their suggestion was quickly retracted due to massive criticism, but it shows how US medical authorities would prefer to lead the world toward medicalizing genital cutting for both sexes. By contrast, European doctors discourage nontherapeutic/cultural genital cutting for both sexes.

0,1,TheJorminator,t5_2qh1i,"Three stories come to mind:

1) A friend of mine works in a concert hall and every once in a while her job is to stay inside the hall and point people who show up late to concerts to their seats. This means that she gets to watch every concert held there, including one amazing opera she told me about that was apparently so beautiful that she started crying and had to go out of the hall for a while so she wouldn't disturb the guests. 

A few weeks later I'm having dinner at my uncle's house and a middle-aged couple (some friends of my uncle) are also there. The conversation turns to this particular opera and the woman (who I had never met before) says ""It was a beautiful opera, I even saw an employee near me working by the doors that started crying, she had to go out for a few minutes!"" 

I found it funny to hear this story from two different perspectives of people who have no clue about each other!

2) I was interrailing with my friend in Europe a few summers ago and was at one point in Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina. We only stopped there for one day and that evening we were at the main square in Sarajevo and suddenly I hear my language, Icelandic, being spoken. I think about what a funny coincidence that is and turn to the person speaking to greet them.  Turns out that not only was that an Icelander, but a guy I went to elementary school with and hadn't seen in years! We were really surprised and happy and then went on to eat and drink together that evening, our only evening in Bosnia.

3) My friend once met a girl in Mallorca and slept with her. Three years later he's travelling in Cambodia, goes to the beach and beside him there is a towel someone had left while going swimming. You can probably already guess who the towel owner was (hint: it was that girl he met in Mallorca).

&gt; That is how most armies in Europe use the standard 2 point slings in their weapons. :P

**Your example picture 1**:  Those guys are walking with the rifles in a casual carry position.  This is not an active combat situation, and I was talking about sling usage during ""actual combat"" like you used the phrase to say that sling are not useful in actual combat.

In this picture, these guys have their hands free but the sling keeps their gun ready in case they need it right away.  If they did not have a sling because they thought it's in the way of combat, then their hands are occupied by holding the gun the whole time.

**Your example picture 2**:  These guys are also not in an active combat situation.  Their guns are in a position slightly closer to ready if needed, so they have their slings very long and loose around the necks (not a good combat position) but this is not their normal position if they are in an active combat situation.  They are stuck here for their presence in front of this civilian crowd.

**Also**: These pictures show the Russian occupation/annexation in Crimea, this is probably not the best ""actual combat"" scenario to analyze.

I'm not a US Military member, so I cannot speak for any of those units.  Whatever opinions I have said about sling usage, I was trying to explain in reference to your discussion about slings being pretty much useless in ""actual combat"" (actual airsoft combat).

**I said ""one-point sling"" because that's what the airsofter in this video used in his demonstration.**  I never made any initial comments about 2-point slings but you brought that up when I talked about one-point sling with neck.

Traditional left-leaning countries such as France will probably have a population that is more sympathetic to those opposed to conservative policies.

0,15,Frostiken,t5_2sfmf,"The single biggest frustration is that people who really do support more gun laws do not seem to want to apply a cause -&gt; effect logic to their arguments. We all want fewer shootings, right? What sense does it make to take an approach to these issues that you think 'well if the shooter couldn't buy an AR-15, he wouldn't shoot people'?

I'm completely with the OP on this.

1) The public school curriculum needs to include gun education. I know a lot of people are salty about them, but the NRA's training programs are extremely high-quality and are, in fact, recognized by the government as being adequate. Introduce a 'tiered' system that is aimed at different age groups. Very young children are taught to stay away from guns and tell an adult if they find one. At around 13 years old, which is about when the Boy Scouts and youth hunting groups and such operate, introduce basic rifle safety and hell, you could even have airgun competitions inside the gym. High school seniors should go through a class that covers the laws, operation, disassembly, and cleaning of handguns and rifles, and basic marksmanship - because within a year most of the kids in that group will be legally adults, and able to own all the guns they want. 

Attending the course shouldn't be required before you can own a gun, nor should the class be only for 'future gun owners'.

A decent amount of firearm accidents are, unfortunately, not strictly preventable - they occur amongst a subset of people who really do know better, but think 'nothing bad could happen to me'. But a lot of them *do* occur in the hands of people who really might not know better. Teaching everyone - even those who never want to own a gun in their lives - would hopefully reach enough people that even in those stupid situations where a guy says 'check out my gun' and starts waving it around, people in the crowd can stop him, knowing that ""relax, it's not loaded"" is *not* safe.

2) Introduce incentives to buy gun safes. OP covered this pretty well. Gun safes are very expensive - a tax rebate would be a great way to get people to buy one.

3) Background checks on all sales, all the time. However, this should be done in a way similar to Switzerland, where you perform the check on yourself. This means removing FFLs as the middleman between the consumer and NICS, and removing the fees associated with it. Furthermore, there should be an easy system where you can simply type in a firearm serial number and find out if the gun was reported stolen or not.

4) A *tremendous* gutting of the more 'unusual' firearm laws on the federal level. Suppressors need to be completely deregulated, as they are a safety device and treated as such even in Europe (and we know how they feel about guns). Short-barreled rifles and shotguns as well - there's really no reason for these to be controlled. Short-barreled rifles especially, since they were originally regulated under the assumption that handguns would be banned. Handguns were not banned, but the SBR law remained on the books. Handguns make any possible 'threat' from an SBR completely moot. We also need to remove the 'sporting purpose' import restrictions (really all import restrictions), and scrub the concept of a 'destructive device'. If people aren't committing crimes with .50 BMG rifles, why should we really care if they want to buy a $12,000 20mm Anzio? Machine guns should be available for purchase again, and are about the only thing that should remain controlled under the National Firearms Act (with removal of the tax stamp). Mainly because getting the public to swallow a machine gun deregulation would be very hard.

5) Under the due process clause, the federal government needs to render state-level firearm restrictions unconstitutional.

0,1,encrusted,t5_2qhcv,"&gt;Then you acted like if my ancestors did or didn't personally feel a certain way, that was somehow related to the validity of the argument.

There was an analogy being made that you agreed to but, frankly, you didn't back it up.

As has already been pointed out we didn't *do* anything except descend from people who favoured their own, generation after generation. If we need to *do* something to morally deserve access to the UK's perks, we have undermined the process that created them. We do that not only at our own peril, but at everyone else's if we're expected to help pull them up. Morality defined in terms of duties often disagrees with morality defined in terms of consequences.

If you need it explained in terms of your analogy - no one would have put up any prize money for the lottery unless they knew it would go to the people who picked the right numbers.

That's why calling it all a lottery we just happened to win for no reason is a mischaracterization.

But if you're correct and we have no more right to this free stuff than anyone else on the planet then the right thing to do would be to open the borders entirely.

I don't know why you're using your argument to justify simply ""sharing wealth"" (which you are right, isn't necessarily pathologically altruistic) - the import of it is that they deserve the same access to our entire social, educational, and financial infrastructure. Because what we have isn't just ""free stuff"" - it wouldn't be the same as giving everyone in the Third World £10,000 cash. The only way to be equitable is to open the borders. Some actually advocate this. There are literally a billion Africans who would move to the UK today given the chance. Cue disaster for us *and* Africa. That's pathological altruism.

&gt;Right, but this doesn't answer in any way why there's some moral superiority, 'I totally deserve this' sentiment going. It's nice to get free stuff, but it's ridiculous to act so entitled.

Are regular working-class people, who pay the most tax, who make sacrifices for their kids, opposing mass immigration because they don't want to be squeezed even harder, acting so entitled?

But you think there's an an economic argument too?

&gt;And the better off other people are, the better off all of us become, morally and economically; overlarge inequality is bad for the national/global economy.

Are you sure? Immigrants send money abroad and therefore spend less domestically than natives. It's consumer spending in the developed world and relatively cheap wages elsewhere paid to people with no options that keeps this gravy train running. If I knew how to fix that...

&gt;The lazy benefits stereotype that often comes up is a bit odd – it’s not your average lazy person who makes the effort to make a new life, a new home, leave behind their family and friends to go some other country hundreds of miles away.

It's becoming more and more clear that many illegal economic migrants - not so much legal immigrants - are leaving because they've been told life at the bottom in the EU, getting benefits just for breathing, is still better.

&gt;have you any idea how to access the benefits systems in the Netherlands, or Spain or Germany?

Neither do they when they get on those boats. They get a nasty surprise when they find out the traffickers lied to them.

&gt;In fact, migrants on average access far fewer benefits than British-born people (with 6% of migrants claiming vs 16% of British-born) – and pay taxes that pay for those benefits (and often return home before they become elderly)

Which immigrants? STEM-educated Poles (that are causing wage compression)? Somalians without education who bypass the immigration process? Poles might be making nest-eggs to take back with them to a comfortably middle-class existence in a country that isn't the Third World. Do Somalians even have the means to return, and why would they want to? What if they're refugees? You can't just average all migrants together when making policy. That's mental.

What's the point of an argument that migrants are good for the reason that they're a less services-demanding subset of an entire society? Young, healthy, haven't had their childcare, healthcare and education starting out in life paid for by us. But in the long run, they - like us - will get old, have disabilities, have children who need education and healthcare, who have disabilities, and - especially important since as you say it's part of why we have an ageing population, the problem their immigration is supposed to solve - become less fertile as they rise the socioeconomic ladder. Those who take the most are the most likely to stay. What you're advocating is a Ponzi scheme.

&gt;In contrast, a greater number of migrants tend to be as males in their 20-30s, as these are people still relatively free from commitments to travel about (less likely to have family and a house elsewhere)

How do you know that's why? Third Worlders marry young and have large families. They're not single and infertile like us. They just get settled down before bringing them over.

&gt;and our entire pensions and healthcare system is predicated on taxpayers paying for both themselves and dependents such as the elderly.

How do non-contributing immigrants solve that and not make it worse? Half of Nigerians in Ireland are claiming unemployment benefit. That means they're not allowed to be working. Yet Nigerians as a whole are sending back to Nigeria an average of €26,000 per person per year - and that's even including children. Either they're scamming benefits or they're working under the table or both. That's €26,000 from every Nigerian man, woman and child, probably not being taxed to help pay for benefits they're probably claiming, and definitely not being invested in the local economy. [Edit: how much they're sending out could be inaccurate - more fact-checking required.]

&gt;As a final point on social services, there is also the fact that large parts of our social services are staffed by overseas workers, particularly the NHS. 

Unfortunately there's a corresponding drop in quality. See http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-04-18/news/49236988_1_niall-dickson-foreign-doctors-bapio and http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/10809221/Doctors-from-India-more-likely-to-be-struck-off.html.

&gt;&gt;Money should go into building those countries up 

&gt;I can potentially agree with you on this but there are some skills that are greatly enhanced in an efficient way by coming to a developed country, working in a first-rate environment, then returning home.

There's accepting genuine refugees (how about taking some from the camps of Syria's neighbours instead of the economic migrants at Calais?), there's accepting people with ability but no opportunity back home, there's educating people and then reversing the brain drain, and then there's inviting everyone over to the World's Soup Kitchen until the soup runs out.

Further, ""Why doesn'teveryone do this and fix their economies?""
Well, because of the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, they sort of...can't. Imposed upon the European Union were policies that ended Greece's ability to snap back from a harsh recession, and it shows in the negative returns on bonds in Germany, the poor inflation and growth in France and England, the rise of psuedo-nationalist political groups, and a general economic malaise across the entire European Union. The fact is, they -can- do this, but where the US has the Federal Reserve, the EU has the European Central Bank, and -they- call the shots over there.
What was wrong with Japan is that they were in a deflationary spiral. This resulting in business closures, unemployment, weirdly irrational prices for even consumption goods and services, and loss of export business via the Chinese. Due to a shortfall of aggregate demand, investments were no longer made. Businesses and would-be entrepreneurs saved their money instead of investing said money, and nobody borrowed, because the price of debt rose over time, as opposed to being devalued mostly by inflation. This caused a disincentive to borrow, a disincentive to lend, meaning few businesses expanded to hire more, forcing them to make due with the pool of workers they had, halting growth, and leading to stagnation, which further forced more work onto the Japanese people, further lowered aggregate demand as fewer were actually working... 20 years ago, they had an aging population that was going to be good for a little while. Now? Not so much. Quantitative easing, it's important to note, is the absolute last stand we have against long-term depression. If the Federal Reserve did not enact these policies, or if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too soon, we could just as easily slip backward and wind up at the end of the line. As it is, an entire generation is going to lose half of what they otherwise would've earned because of terrible economic policy that caused the crash, during the crash, before the Federal Reserve acted, after the Federal Reserve acted, and even today. 
You cannot save your way out of a recession once you're already in it. However, when you're -not- in a recession, THAT is when you save. Unfortunately, instead of saving during the good times, we ended up lowering taxes and going to war, increasing spending across the board, and banking on some fool's gold of a plan (that tax breaks encourage growth, or worse, that cutting taxes increases tax revenue) to make up for it. This left us categorically ill-positioned to deal with the aftermath of a deregulation-caused housing disaster.

However, what I feel that this article, and those personalities fail to recognize however is that as teams are getting better, and the game is evolving the 'snowball' strategies are becoming less optimal. It is no longer an optimal play to take risks tower diving the enemy mid, blowing summoners offensively etc for what I'd call a 'low percentage play'. 

The reason I believe teams are favoring more utility and control style mids is because it is a safe bet. It is far, far less risky to use viktor/azir/cassiopeia/ziggs to safely rack up massive cs numbers using their laning strengths and scale into a strong lategame than it is to go for flashy assassin plays. For example - bjergsen was heavily criticised after MSI for playing cho'gath, ziggs and cassiopeia and being unable to 'carry' games despite gaining a massive cs lead. Naturally, there were problems within TSM and this cs lead wasn't enough to tip the game in their favor, however if the teams were more even (or more importantly IF TSM WERE THE BETTER TEAM) then this would have been a completely risk-free earlygame lead. 


I also believe this is one of the reasons TSM early this year were intent on learning other styles other than mid priority and a hard scaling botlane. It's because they realised that although it's possible for bjerg to dumpster NA midlaners, it wasn't possible to consistently recreate against better teams and thus wasn't reliable. 

TLDR - Provided you are actually the better team and don't need to cheese or snowball, it is more optimal to play safe, farm oriented, consistent dps mids and then win the game through rotations/wave management/objective control.

You've acknowledged that nobody but Putin knows what his end goals are or why he's doing what he's doing, but you go on to make declarative statements about why he's doing things.  That's fine for internet conversation, but it's not the kind of thing that sets global policy - and that is why you see NATO taking this seriously.

It's beyond premature to think that Putin is smart, so he won't let this go too far, and therefore it won't go too far, and therefore we don't have anything to worry about.  There *is* a conflict happening right now - a cold war.  There are times where the very competent and intelligent leaders of the USA and the USSR very nearly started actual global warfare over issues not much (if any) larger than Ukraine.

I don't believe Putin wants a puppet nation - that's never going to happen because Ukraine is never going to fall into his hands.  Everything that isn't the far East is pretty solidly pro-European, so it can't and won't become a buffer.

Rather, I think what Putin is doing is attempting to gain influence, control, territory and advance Russia's agenda which is largely at odds with the West.  It's not like Putin is going to stop if Russia were to get Donetsk and Lugansk - and it's not like the west or Kiev could ever accept Russia slicing off such a huge part of their country.  Putting and end to it might not necessarily be pretty, and just as much as these tit-for-tat games can lead to gradual de-escalation as one side realizes they've got all they are going to get, these situations can also escalate and turn into war.  Often over things nobody would ever have expected.

This is all a very dangerous game, and there are a lot of people (not civilians, but people in the military.. analysts, senior officials, NATO officials, european politicians) who are genuinely concerned that this  very well may escalate.

I went to India in December for a wedding but had really just started the whole thing in November. India also for some reason was kind to me. I didn't gain any weight and actually dropped a couple pounds. I think it was the high heat and so much walking that did it. I was also exposed to mostly vegetarian food (which I'm not a big fan of) so I wouldn't eat THAT much. Still, I felt like I was eating so much food but when I came back and weighed myself I was glad I wasn't set back. Also went on a road trip to Pittsburgh a couple weekends ago but that was only 2 days. 

As for Europe, I am a little worried and expecting to gain some weight. The food is going to be great and I plan to eat out with the rest of the people I'm going with. However I do still plan to log in everything to MFP (bonus is that I keep my logging streak alive :p). I figured that since my TDEE is 2500 calories, and if I eat 3500 calories a day (1000 over) during my 21 day trip, I'll gain 6 pounds. While it's not good, I also don't think it's a crazy big amount and of course I'm overestimating with 3500/day. I know some days will be less and I'll also be walking a lot which gives me back some more calories.

0,2,lesserstuff,t5_30hhs,"Keep in mind Yatsenyuk and Tyrchinov were not trusted, and the speech is just promises with no judicial base.

So the main point is that he together with President Turchynov will not pass the suggestion of removal of the [2012 law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language_in_Ukraine#Russian_language_in_Ukrainian_politics) which made Russian a ""regional language"" which passed the parliament (the removal of the law passed the parliament). He says this will keep Russian as de facto official in relevant regions. And there will not be any removal of rights for Russian speakers. This is more damage control than an offer, it wasn't more than status-quo. The people got really angry when the [first thing](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26312008) the interim government did was to vote through the limitations of the rights of the Russian language as well as clearing the parliament of the opposition. And with presidential election coming this promise wasn't very solid. The demand was to make Russian co-official language. 

He also talks about decentralization, how it will allow questions of history and culture be decided on regional level and control of finances. This will be in a new constitution. The problem with this is they never went through with it. [One month](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/ukraine-to-adopt-laws-on-decentralization-of-power-within-three-months-343388.html) after the speech (a bit late) they gave the order to make a draft about decentralization to be complete within three months. 

[One month](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-agrees-to-decentralization-talks-but-without-insurgents-1.2642274) later they are against decentralization and have to be coerced by the EU and OSCE. But they gave no indication of being interested in decentralization anyway: ""Even as Yatsenyuk launched the talks he was dismissive of them, thanking the OSCE for its efforts but saying Ukraine has its own plan to end the crisis. He gave no details of that plan"". Kiev also demanded that the separatist not attend the talks.

The reason for not wanting to talk to the separatists is [possibly](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/05/ukraine-agrees-decentralisation-talks-201451413613392256.html): ""Opening the talks [with OSCE about decentralization] on Wednesday, Turchynov said, ""Those with weapons in hand who are waging a war against their own country and dictating the will of a neighboring country will answer before the law. We will not yield to blackmail."" So they seem to acknowledge that these are citizens of Ukraine but they don't like that they have occupied government buildings (btw this happened in western Ukraine before Yanukovych stepped down, they stole at least anti tank guns and BTR, also happened in Kiev). ""....Dictating the will of a neighboring country"" seems like they now blame Russia for separatists demand for decentralization which might be why they ignored OSCE and started their own plan. Here they already completely ignore the speech and the previous order for a draft.

Lets say the request to not talk to the separatists is valid. They still were against an EU and OSCE plan of decentralization (which EU still supports and have given Ukraine money for). And I guess didn't want the support of the Donbass and south-east population who were for decentralization, aka the people he addressed in his speech.

Finally on April 6th 2015 more than one year after Yatsenyuk nice speech. Poroshenko is now president and he lifts [his objections to a referendum that could give more powers to the regions](http://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-leader-lifts-objections-vote-regional-power-094037913.html). Now they have gone from decentralization draft within three months to ""I'm ready to launch a referendum on the issue of state governance if you [parliamentary commission] decide it is necessary, he said"". Again separatists are not invited. 

Today the only thing that has forced the issue of decentralization is the Minsk agreements. And you could argue that these where forced upon the government because the agreements where signed after big defeats of the Ukrainian army (signed after defeat at Amvrosiivka and encirclement of Debaltseve), together with EU pressure. 

You could also argue that they didn't go on with the decentralization in 2014 because the separatists started and escalated an armed conflict. But this makes Ukraine forget about the civilians of Donbass, who according to the government where occupied against their wishes. This also gives the current decentralization effort a weird angle. When now even more Ukrainian soldiers have died who fought against this and the region is less likely to return to Ukrainian control. If the government didn't want it when the armed hostilities started why would they want it now etc.

There also talk of other stuff. Like they won't allow any illegal armed groups (on Ukraine's side) and that anyone who wants to defend Ukraine should join the army. Today there are still illegal armed groups fighting for Ukraine, for example OUN. 

They say east shouldn't fear any ""banderovtsi"", (the fear was that [these guys ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fKIq8fE1CE) would come to the east and do the same thing that they did in Kiev).
[They](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/in-kharkiv-ukraines-biggest-pro-russian-city-a-question-of-who-is-in-charge/2014/02/27/8baca598-9fd2-11e3-a050-dc3322a94fa7_story.html) came and the government didn't try to stop it.

People arguing for guns remaining legal too often tout self defense as a primary reason. Thing is that it is a primary reason, but only in those places with high criminal gun use. Defense against wild animals is primary in low population places with large predators. 

And you seem to be entirely discounting the value in target practice (which actually reduces unintended deaths), but has other reasons as well.

I have to inform you that most of the pro-EU center-right of Greece right now are convinced that SYRIZA has a plan to secede from the EU. They believe it has created an elaborate plan to bring us to this horrible point so that we will hate foreigners and willingly say no to the EU. 

I will not claim I consider it 100% certain. However, I will say that I can not discount it.

Why? Because there are indications it might be true. The SYRIZA party has purely Communist factions. Look up the MPs Lafazanis and Lapavitsas for example, they have a purely Communist background or/and they are anti-Euro and anti-EU. Even Tsipras has a purely Communist background.

I believe there is a real chance this planning might be true making them really dangerous if it unfolds.

Furthermore various of their moves the past few days indicate towards that. The most blatant one is that they waited for the very last moment to call the referendum. They now attack foreigners for closing the banks. However, the banks had to close anyway because 5 Parliaments would have to ratify an extension of the old program for that to not happen [there was no time at all, there were only 4-5 hours left to find the 5 approvals, something ridiculously impossible]. Did they not know that? Of course they did. Why did they do the referendum at the very last moment and not a week before? I can't see another explanation, it is planned, by SYRIZA. The banks close and blame the 'bad foreigners'.

This goes hand-in-hand perfectly with the blatant loaded question of that ridiculous referendum question. Notice that it doesn't ask the people to accept the SYRIZA proposal which was approximately equally harsh, it only asks ""do you want the proposal of those foreigners?"". It seems it was all a ploy to instill negativity towards the 'no' that they want. Even the KKE party exposed them for that hypocrisy with the use of that loaded question, and at a referendum at that.

Again, I do not discount it's just megalomania and incompetence but there is also a good chance of a plan. Or a combination.

But they didn’t make an offer because it didn’t have high speed Internet.

“We wouldn’t choose a house that didn’t have electricity,” Ms. Burke, 26 years old, said as she explained why. “It’s right on par with those things.”

As the Internet becomes central to the way Americans work and live, the digital divide is taking on greater economic significance. Students without Internet access at home may struggle to keep up with school assignments. Towns with less access find themselves falling behind economically, researchers say. Now, the availability of speedy Internet service is starting to affect Americans’ biggest purchase: their homes.

Real-estate agents across the country say more buyers like Ms. Burke and Mr. Cairns are turning their noses up at homes without fast Web access. Some studies suggest those buyers are having a keen effect on home prices. A nationwide study released on Monday by researchers at the University of Colorado and Carnegie Mellon University finds fiber-optic connections, the fastest type of high speed Internet available, can add $5,437 to the price of a $175,000 home—about as much as a fireplace, or half the value of a bathroom.

David Mans, a real-estate agent outside Boulder, Colo., said after he started noting in his online listings whether properties had Internet availability, he got fewer calls about properties that didn’t have it. “I have situations where people won’t even look at it if it doesn’t have broadband,” Mr. Mans said.

What people want in a home can vary a lot, and values can depend heavily on broader market forces. But real estate professionals say there are certain features that can be a deciding factor—like an extra bathroom or pool. And broadband is starting to figure into that same calculus.

Telecom companies by law are required to make telephone service available to every residence in their service areas, but the same isn’t true for all high speed Internet providers. Phone lines can deliver DSL service, typically slower than 10 megabits a second. Satellite service is usually even slower. Fiber and some cable can deliver speeds of up to 1,000 megabits a second.

University of Colorado researchers compared more than 520,000 home sales between 2011 and 2013 against government data on the type of Internet access available. It built on a 2013 study by the same researchers that found a similar effect on home prices in New York state. The researchers expanded their study with funding from The Fiber to the Home Council Americas, a group made up of municipalities, small telecom companies, and others like Google Inc. that support the expansion of fiber networks.

The results mirrored the findings of a 2014 study by the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater that found access to the Internet could add $11,815 to the value of a $439,000 vacation house in Door County, Wis.

The impact is most acute in rural areas, where Internet speeds tend to drop dramatically. As of 2013, 92% of urban areas had high speed Internet, compared with 47% of rural areas, according to the most recent data from the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC defines high speed as 25 megabits per second or more.

John Wilczak was getting wireless high speed Internet via Verizon’s cell towers at his home in Santa Ynez, Calif., a town of about 4,400 near Santa Barbara. Cable and phone companies sell high speed Internet downtown, but they hadn’t built along his street. Mr. Wilczak’s Verizon service worked like a cellphone plan. Once when friends brought their children for a week-long visit, the children blew past his 50 gigabyte monthly cap and he was hit with a more than $900 bill.

Mr. Wilczak recently moved to a new house and dropped Verizon in favor of a local wireless Internet company without data caps. He said at least half of the 40 people who considered buying his old house weren’t interested in part because it lacked reliable Internet

Unreliable Internet almost derailed Adam Frost’s online business selling wooden toys made in European workshops. Mr. Frost tried using satellite Internet when he first moved to New Salem, Mass., about seven years ago from a New York City suburb, where he was paying about $60 a month for high speed Internet.

“We were told there was adequate Internet access when we got up here, and then discovered there really isn’t,” Mr. Frost said. The satellite service would go down during bad weather, and he consistently went over his monthly data limit.

Mr. Frost decided to pay Verizon $600 a month to install a dedicated copper wire to his house for more reliable service. But it still isn’t fast enough, especially as online services grow more data intensive. Last year it took him 24 hours to download a software update for his computer, and just as the download was nearly finished, his connection crashed and he had to start all over.

In Western Massachusetts, where Mr. Frost lives, local officials are trying to solve the problem by building their own high speed networks. To accomplish that they’re borrowing a tactic developed a century ago when the region was struggling to gain access to electricity. More than 40 towns have formed a cooperative of Municipal Lighting Plants, a type of public utility first invented to build electricity infrastructure, and are raising funds to build out fiber connections.

Monica Webb is the chairwoman of the cooperative, called WiredWest. So far this year, 19 of those towns have passed bond measures to fund construction. More than 40% of residents in 14 of those towns have already paid a deposit for service.

“Some might call us a coalition of the desperate,” Ms. Webb said. “We’re already feeling the negative impacts of not having adequate broadband.”

Ms. Burke and Mr. Cairns, who passed on the yellow three-bedroom house in May, decided not to make any offers until they see which towns commit to the project.

“After we looked at I think maybe 10 houses we were like, ‘It doesn’t really matter. We can’t pick a house because we don’t know which towns are doing this,’ ” Ms. Burke said. “The towns that don’t pass it we absolutely will rule out. It’s not a question.”",t1_cspeci1,t3_3bsgd1,0,,,,70,False,,1437510574,technology,False,False,0,1435801089,t1_cspa5ub,cspeci1

Korea was going from a 2-team league to a 1-team league, meaning an organization that had two really good teams (SKT, Samsung, etc.) now had 5 players they had to release. When a few top names got signed to China for big money, the rest of them immediately left as well.

But there is also more money in China for different reasons. China has multiple big-name streaming websites, meaning they pay exceptionally good wages to get the next ""best"" streamer on their site instead of the others. And of course there's the fact that China's eSports is backed by Tencent instead of Riot Games, who have more money.

So Korean players didn't just go to China for bigger team contracts, but because the *entire* scene (streaming, prize pools, etc.) are all higher than Korea.

I have to inform you that most of the pro-EU center-right of Greece right now are convinced that SYRIZA has a plan to secede from the EU. They believe it has created an elaborate plan to bring us to this horrible point so that we will hate foreigners and willingly say no to the EU. 

I will not claim I consider it 100% certain. However, I will say that I can not discount it.

Why? Because there are indications it might be true. The SYRIZA party has purely Communist factions. Look up the MPs Lafazanis and Lapavitsas for example, they have a purely Communist background or/and they are anti-Euro and anti-EU. Even Tsipras has a purely Communist background.

I believe there is a real chance this planning might be true making them really dangerous if it unfolds.

Furthermore various of their moves the past few days indicate towards that. The most blatant one is that they waited for the very last moment to call the referendum. They now attack foreigners for closing the banks. However, the banks had to close anyway because 5 Parliaments would have to ratify an extension of the old program for that to not happen [there was no time at all, there were only 4-5 hours left to find the 5 approvals, something ridiculously impossible]. Did they not know that? Of course they did. Why did they do the referendum at the very last moment and not a week before? I can't see another explanation, it is planned, by SYRIZA. The banks close and blame the 'bad foreigners'.

This goes hand-in-hand perfectly with the blatant loaded question of that ridiculous referendum question. Notice that it doesn't ask the people to accept the SYRIZA proposal which was approximately equally harsh, it only asks ""do you want the proposal of those foreigners?"". It seems it was all a ploy to instill negativity towards the 'no' that they want. Even the KKE party exposed them for that hypocrisy with the use of that loaded question, and at a referendum at that.

Again, I do not discount it's just megalomania and incompetence but there is also a good chance of a plan. Or a combination.

&gt;TLDR if you don't want to wade through the 8 paradox simulator franchises that are the exact same game but focus on different things: nope.

&gt;In EUIV, you are supposed to play the Colonizer to get the full effect, not the colonized. You aren't even meant to go beyond 1821. For this reason USA, Mexico, and all formable nations from colonies are unfinished and no mods flesh them out on the level of other nations.

&gt;EUIV is more war oriented, and Victoria II is basically EUIV but with way more focus on diplomacy and politics. Neither allow you to talk anyone into the Union. EUIV because its war oriented, and Victoria II simulates the racism and political differences that America had to Mexico, stonewalling any sort of Union between the two countries.

Detailed explanation of the 2 copy paste simulators that Paradox sell to capture both markets:

In the normal game, hell no. Not even in Victoria II, the more politically oriented variant of EUIV/EUIII from the same company meant for people who want politics in their simulator, does that become an option. All you have is the Manifest Destiny decision which declares war on anyone holding any sort of land in North America.

Even though you can't talk people into the union in Victoria, if you fuck up during the civil war, the Mexican American war, or piss off some states that belong to another political party off the Union falls apart and you can't put it back together again. America can decline into 3 separate nations, the Confederates, the Union, and the free states. Once the free states declare independence you most likely lost. Especially if you JUST declared Manifest destiny before the civil war and Mexico decides to take revenge on your attempt to steal their land from them.

In Europa IV however, the timeline is so short that unless you decide to fire off the independence early you have less than 50 years left of being America as the game ends in 1821, the end of the Colonial era marked by Mexico's victory over spain. Which means you have zero time to actually play as America and Mexico.

The independent colonies are almost always short playthroughs, and the colonies are all unfinished nations with zero depth. The only country you could POSSIBLY play for a long time is Mexico due to New Spain being available first, which you can declare war on spain and turn into Mexico but you still end up in the game pretty damn late with nothing to do beyond that point. The only way to play ""Mexico"" for any real amount of time for the full length of the game in the vanilla game is to play the Aztecs, which new patches and expansions have nerfed them so hard that by the time the 1500s roll around they are pretty much destined to lose against Spain unless you are some sort of genius level player. Even if you survive, the tech tree system means you will always be running older tech due to the 250% penalty you get for research that gets applied to every new world nation. Every nation that isn't europe gets a huge research penalty. So that means any sort of Northern Native American nation trying to turn into the United States of America also gets the same penalty except there is no way in hell they can raise more than a small army stack since they can't expand their borders fast enough.

So you get screwed as a new world player regardless. New world nations are not meant to be played seriously, and are all unfinished in EU IV.",t1_cspfnkr,t3_3bt4l5,0,,,,80,False,,1437511534,gaming,False,1435821851,0,1435803587,t1_csp8xdf,cspfnkr

Non touristy places are interesting, but also depressing. 

Eventually many cities look all the same, because they share the same history: small village not long ago, then massive construction in the 20th century. The same old 6 story residential blocks built 30 years ago, the same 25 story apartment towers built 15 years ago, the same ramshackle buildings of the old days which will soon be demolished, and which are not even worth saving from a European's perspective. Don't expect any European style ""old towns"" in most places. And even if there are ""old towns"" the concept of preservation is often not well understood - i.e. it's not ""leave things original"" but rather ""use modern means to make things look like they once did"", like the rebuilt sections of the Great Wall, which aren't really very old.

Anyway, non-touristy places: Taiyuan - the capital of dust. Any city between Xiamen and the tulous - welcome to the home of depressing factory towns in the middle of nowhere.

West Ham begins Europa League qualification with a home leg against the Andorran league runners-up, Lusitanos. The Hammers will be without their newly appointed manager, Slaven Bilic, who is away on vacation.  West Ham’s starting XI, which was named earlier today, features a mixture of new faces and experienced club regulars. The lineup includes Diafra Sakho and Mauro Zarate who are decent enough Premiere League strikers. I would expect both to score multiple goals in this match. 


Lusitanos have played in 4 European qualifying competitions in the past 5 years. The away legs went something like this:


* L 5-1 @ EB/Streymur (2013 Champions League Qualifying)

* L 8-0 @ Valetta (2012 Champions League Qualifying)

* L 5-1 @ Varteks (2011 Europa League Qualifying)

* L 5-0 @ Rabotnicki (2010 Europa League Qualifying)


Lusitanos lost badly to clubs who play in the Faroe Islands, Macedonia, Croatia and Malta. They have never seen a team with depth and quality like West Ham. Pre-season rust, playing without their new coach and playing with a B/C team should all be non-factors. 

My pick: **West Ham United: Wins By 6+ Goals**

There is a good conference that explains this entitled [Is Mercantilism Doomed to Fail?](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLudkhivEgRdhBEyh0mrv-E9v5Y7yAhnOh). If you look at the CIA factbook Germany has a GDP of $3.915 trillion and a whopping $1.511 trillion of exports. Germany has a very unbalanced mercantilist economy compared to the rest of the world highly dependant on exports, with a very weak domestic demand. 

When Germany suppressed wages artificially by having a long wage freeze and even cutting wages, it artificially improved German ""kompetitiveness"". especially in the EU and eurozone with reduced trade barriers and a single currency. Germany looked and looks at the EU to ruthlessly allow German companies to expand at the expense of the rest of the Eurozone. But for economies that do not have almost 40% of their GDP expressed in exports, such measures are outright suicidal. In Spain and Italy two large Eurozone economies, exports are 20+% of GDP. When you impose austerity, you kill their economies. 
I would highly recommend the talk of the non-chauvnist German economist at that conference:

Laws in western countries varied over the past couple centuries regarding at what age a child could consent to marriage - many of the laws pertaining to which dealt with various women's rights and laws against rape. The age of consent was originally set as early as 10-12 years of age and then was moved to 14 given that's the average age young girls will start their menstrual cycles. This, of course, varies widely from woman to woman; eventually the age of consent was raised to 16 and then raised again to 18 due to protests from reformers in the US - Brittish and European groups followed suit.

It basically comes down to, as /u/HollowBlades mentioned, a balance between what's considered an appropriate physiological and psychological maturity level. There were other debate factors in deciding what should be the appropriate age of consent, and age of consent still varies depending on which country you live in. [Kind of a brief history on the matter.](http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/case-studies/230) It's also about human rights. Children shouldn't be forced into such relationships before they're ready for that situation and responsibility.

There are still plenty of places in the world (particularly in impoverished countries) where child marriages are still common - some of which include two children being married to each other while others include a child (typically a girl) being married to a much older husband. In these types of arrangements, the [child wives are usually prevented from earning any substantial education, are restricted from receiving proper medical care, are generally dis-empowered and forced to live completely dependent on their husbands. These child brides are neither physically or emotional ready to become wives or mothers (some being as young as eight or nine) and thus suffer more significantly from childbirth complications, contracting HIV/AIDS and suffering from domestic violence. Child pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading cause of death in 15-19 year old in low income countries; for those girls who survive the childbirth at such young ages, they may live the rest of their lives being permanently disfigured in such ways that they become banned from their communities.](http://www.girlsnotbrides.org/about-child-marriage/)

There was a powerful PBS NOVA documentary called *Walk to Beautiful* that showed the stories of several women in cultures where they were child brides and suffered childbirth complications (obstetric fistula - you can look it up if you so want the details). These women were pretty much disowned by their husbands and communities - forced to live on the outskirts and fend for themselves without any feasible resources. The young women were brought to a rural hospital that practices in surgically fixing these injuries so the women may return to their villages, find their own empowerment, and become active members again. It's a heartbreaking story, but these are the lives women who are thrown into child marriages often suffer. It's no way to live.

Spicy Olive Pasta: Canned Tomato again (whole actually goes well here, you break it up in the pan but diced is also good) a Jar of whole pitted kalamata olives (depends but you can get this for about $3 usually), some chilli flakes (if you don't have these then you can get them for cheap). Cook up the olives in some oil and the chilli flakes just until they get hot. Then pour in a bit of the olive brine (not too much).

What to buy

(Somebody please continue/contribute to this with suggestions for the smaller sizes with shallow shapes &lt;3. I also welcome any suggestions you might have, I would especially be interested in info for 28/26/24 bandsizes.)

Just found out your size? Here is how to shop for it. 

The size you got from the calculator is just a starting point. For about 50% of women the calculator is spot on, +/- one cupsize or one bandsize. For others there is more variation. You might need larger or smaller depending upon size, shape, firmness of tissue, root width and a gazillion other factors.  Only way to find out which size you need is to try on bras in several sizes. 

To figure out your size, it is a good idea to order a few beginner bras. These are regular bras that run true to size and fit a wide range of women well, they also allow you to nail your size even if the fit is completely off. (You find a list at the bottom of the page.)

Order 1-3 beginner bras in 2-4 sizes. If you try a bra in 3 sizes and neither size works, you know it is the bra and not the size that is wrong. Trying a few bras that way helps you determine your bra size - if there is one size that is consistenly the best, that is your size.

Don't worry too much about breast shape at this point. One important disctintion is shallow /not shallow because it determines which beginner bras will suit you. But apart from that beginner bras are also meant to help you work out shape, not just size, so don't fret if you don't know at this stage. 

Once you found your size, you can order more bras in that size. 

Be prepared to order and return 25+ bras until you find ""the one"". For this reason it is important to order from a shop with free shipping and free returns initially, even if the bras costs more. It will save you money in the long run. In the US, Amazon and Nordstrom offer free shipping and free returns, in Canada Butterflycollection.ca.  

Keep track of what you tried. It helps you work out what works and does not work. An account with Bratabase.com is great for this. Especially if you measure and enter the bras you order you quickly learn what you need. But you can also use pen and paper. 

If you buy bras from ebay, braswap, zulily and other places where you cannot return them, research the bras before you commit yourself. Seach the ABTF subreddit, Bratabase, use search engines to find bra blogs with reviews of this bra. Buying bras cheap from places with no returns is a gamble, you can end up with a lot of bras that don't fit right that way and risk spending more money on 5 ill-fitting bras than one really good one. 

When you are trying on things in a store, taking photos of the tags is quick and really useful. It also helps to take pictures of yourself in the bra. You don't have to show these photos to anybody, but they help you remember what you did not like about a certain bra several months later. 

Many bra brands are made with a certain breastshape in mind. For this reason many women tend to get consistently good results with a certain brand and cut of that brand. It can also be that none of the bras of a certain brand work for you. Only way to find out is by trial and error and research. 

Good beginner bras for larger cupsizes and more projected shapes:

Panache/Cleo:

- Panache Andorra

- Panache Envy

- Panache Jasmine 

- Panache Tango II Balc. (works best in 32-42 GG/H/HH)

- Cleo Lucy/Kali (28-38 D-J)

- Cleo Marcie, Cleo Lily (28-38 D-J)

Andorra, Envy and Jasmine are based upon the same cut, Andorra fits almost everybody, Envy is a wider, more full-on-bottom shape, Jasmine is more projected and with less volume in the bottom, if one is close but no cigar one of the other two will usually be perfect.

For Cleo Marcie/Lily and Cleo Lucy similar applies. Marcie and Lily are based upon the same cut, Lucy is a different cut, but usually one of the three is a decent fit. Please also look up the other bras based upon Cleo George/Marcie and Cleo Alexa/Lily on bratabase. 

Fantasie and Freya:

- Fantasie Jana Side Support, Fantasie Lois Side Support

- Fantasie Elodie (UK 30-38 D-H, 40DD-FF)

- Freya Oh La La 

- Freya Rio (UK 28-38 D-H)

Note that above 32H/34GG/36G/38FF the wires of Freya and Fantasie become too soft for good support and get unstable. While some models are available up to UK 36K with Freya and UK 40K with Fantasie these bras work best in the E-GG range. If you find Freya/Fantasie a good fit yet need a larger size, consider switching out the wires for harder, more durable ones. 

Curvy Kate:

- Curvy Kate Princess 

- Curvy Kate Portia

- Curvy Kate Bardot

- Curvy Kate Dreamcatcher 

Curvy Kate (especially older cuts like Princess) work best for a full-on-top 3+4 shape.  If you get a funny upside-down seven shape in Curvy Kate Princess, try some of the newer cuts like Dreamcatcher or the more full-on-bottom friendly Portia. If the problem persists, this brand is not for you. 

Bras and brands with larger bandsizes: 

- Goddess Keira/Kayla/Adelaide (US 34 i-N, 36 DD-N)

- Goddess Alice, Goddess Clara (US 34-44 G-N, 46 G-M, 48 G-L)

- Elomi Caitlyn (UK 34F-K, 36-42DD-K, 44-46 DD-HH)

- Elomi Rita (UK 34 G-K, 36-40 E-K, 42HH, 44H, 46FF)

- Elila 2311 (US 36-46 DD-K)

- Elila 1305 (US 34-52 F-N, their 52N is the largest cupsize-bandsize combo bra you can buy that is not custom-made)

- Panache Sculptresse ChiChi (36-46 D-H, same cut as Panache Jasmine) 

If you are in the UK, the EU or can get them cheap, Bravissimo housebrand and Gorgeous by Debenhams (the Debenhams housebrand) is really good. Sadly the shipping from the UK to the US and back makes ordering them impractical for many people in the US.

I am hoping this will happen so EU come into senses and finds a compromise. Unfortunately, its not happening.

&gt;That's what Tsipras is saying.... that doesn't mean it's credible. He's been offered a deal, he recommends that the Greek people reject it and despite promising no referendum he's called a referendum and encouraged them to reject it.

I see him sending more and more offers. Just three versions the last 10 days. How many the EU send again?

&gt;If you read/listen to his most recent speech it's quite clear he's now just lying.

**LCS EU W6 D1**

Current Blue Side/Red Side Stats: 29-21

Current LCS Poll Fan Vote Stats: 35-15

&amp;nbsp;

* All odds based on https://nitrogensports.eu/r/414
* Boring lineup today 

&amp;nbsp;

* **ROCCAT** over SK Gaming @2.03 - ROCCAT blue side/fan vote.  Both teams need this win.  Both teams have underperformed all season.  Both teams had decent weeks last week.  This is a straight 50/50 and the odds are accurate.  Due to this, I am skipping it.  If I had to bet, I'd go ROCCAT as there is a little value and blue side/fan vote edge. **Skip**  

&amp;nbsp;

* **Gambit** over Copenhagen Wolves @ 1.33 - Gambit blue side/fan vote.  Not much to say here.  CW is in a sad state.  Losing three members due to unrest within the team, they have resorted to challenger players from the ladder.  These two players aren't even on current challenger series teams.  Gambit will exploit the new players, particularly Lenny in the top lane.  Safe to go big here.  **10 units**.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Fnatic** over Giants @ 1.19 - Giants blue side/Fnatic fan vote.  Fnatic is 10-0, soon to be 12-0.  People can say the Giants had a good start to the season but honestly they've just been lucky/mediocre.  The last time these teams played, Fnatic rolled them over.  Giants did not even try, swapping positions for fun.  This is another safe bet and good game to parlay with Gambit.  **10 units**  

&amp;nbsp;

* **Fnatic+Gambit** parlay @ 1.6 **5 units**
* **Fnatic+Gambit+H2K** parlay @ 2.1 **4 units**

&amp;nbsp;

* **Unicorns of Love** over Origen @ 3.3 - Unicorns blue/Origen fan vote.  Yes, Origen will most likely win this.  It is 70/30 in favor of Origen in my opinion.  This makes the odds very accurate.  **2 units** on Unicorns as I believe they are due for their typical mid season upset and their playstyle is one that can throw Origen off.  If Unicorns can get ahead early through a cheesy pick/ban or aggression, Origen is still shaky playing from behind. **2 units** Unicorns.

&amp;nbsp;

* **H2K** over Elements @ 1.36 - Elements blue side/H2K fan vote.  H2K should come into this match looking to redeem themselves for last week.  That being said, I believe they are a bit too favored here.  Elements showed a spark last week with Nyph leading them from the botlane.  If Elements can keep Kasing off Thresh, it will be a close game.  Kasing has yet to show a good game on any champion besides Thresh this split.  I am skipping this one.  **Skip**

If I don't mind waiting up to 180 days, I can get any fully automatic or select-fire weapon plus two cases of ammunition starting around $3,000.

If you want to start a militia, you can create a trust for the militia and get it a class 2 or 3 firearms license. With that license, you'd then be able to acquire any firearms without paying federal taxes on them provided that every individual who joins the trust (militia) can pass a federal background check (no felony convictions or if you have a felony conviction, you must have your rights restored by a court).

Or you know, I can go grab a gun and hunt some deer with a $15 hunting license.

On a more serious note, we hate government getting involved where they don't belong. Most Americans think that universal healthcare isn't actually that bad of an idea but the Republicans keep shouting about the terrors of it (there aren't many compared to our current system) and the Democrats would rather sell out to insurance companies in exchange for more campaign donations. Most Americans think that the government should be involved in education, many even argue that they should pay for all education including college and university. Most Americans want the government staying out of the bedroom, living room, house, and really any private area. They also want the right to say whatever the fuck they want. They want the right to defend themselves.

Did you know in some states it's illegal to fire warning shots? According to most states and people, the only reason you should EVER fire a gun is if you intend to kill something or are training at a range. And legally, the only time outside of hunting or shooting at a range you can ever discharge a weapon is in self-defense. Most gun related crimes are cases of self-defense. The largest portion of the population receiving concealed carry weapon (CCW) permits are women.

Guns eliminate the differences in power between people. A gun can be the difference between a man or woman ending up in the hospital, dead, or raped and going on with their life with mild to severe PTSD from killing someone. A gun can allow someone to protect their family in case of a home invasion. In Oklahoma, there was a woman who's ex-husband was breaking into her house with an axe. The only weapon she had was a shotgun. She killed him as soon as he broke through her door. In any other nation, she'd most likely be dead.

Cases like the one I just described happen all the time. In Europe, people die and are seriously injured in attacks. Few people manage to successfully defend themselves. In the US, most people manage to defend themselves in some capacity if attacked because they are allowed to carry a gun or a knife or some other defensive weapon like OC spray (pepper spray in layman's terms).

Weapons are nothing to be afraid of. Weapons do not hurt people. People hurt people. Legal weapons allow people to defend themselves. Making weapons illegal makes it so that only the criminals are armed.

Sorry if I wrote a lot, I'm very passionate about this. I do not personally own a gun, but I do own several knives that are illegal in most developed nations and I have extensive gun and weapon training for self-defense and hunting. I personally think that people should be required to complete gun safety courses before being allowed to acquire their first gun. But I believe that anyone should be able to own and possess a gun to use in the defense of self and others.",t1_csphnzr,t3_3bq85n,0,IntelRadeon,,,3,False,,1437513336,pcgaming,False,False,0,1435807542,t1_csph3id,csphnzr

It's pretty awful, but I guess they think it's a small price to pay to get people to take drunk driving seriously; I have no idea if it's actually effective.  You're correct, drunk driving is a big problem.  Personally, I would venture that part of the problem is the high drinking age (21).  IMO, it creates a taboo around alcohol (making it more desirable) and a bunch of kids who can't hold their liquor and don't know their limits.  Kids are afraid to call their parents for a ride home, and since they're generally drinking at private homes and not bars downtown, cabs are tough to come by (and expensive).  The cops will arrest you if they catch you drinking in a public place (or possibly even at a private home, but that's less common).

Davis doesn't mention Schauble, but it is the powerful German voice on all the relevant European bodies that prevents more being done to help Greece -- unfortunately, the formative experience for German economics was not the Great Depression, as in the US and UK, but Weimar-era hyperinflation, and so German macroeconomists have rather a perverse slant compared to the otherwise-globally-dominant Anglo-Saxon perspective.

Juncker is a figurehead and far out of his depth; he has no power and most likely no future.  Draghi has probably been about as helpful to Greece as his role allows.  And Lagarde's hands are tied; the IMF is already accused of being heavily biased towards Europe and the US.

Make no mistake: the ongoing crisis in the Eurozone is not due to the unelected, unaccountable trio Davis picks out.  The reality is far more tragic: it is the democratic nature of the eurozone that is dragging it apart.  Committees composed of technocrats would have reached a sensible, moderate decision long ago, but with politicians at the helm we have instead the reality that it is in every politician's interest to appear to be getting his or her country (and hence electorate) the best deal without the 'weakness' of compromise -- thus, brinksmanship.

This is a subject ripe for criticism, but is left well alone because it appeals neither to ideological Eurosceptics, who hardly wish to provide an argument for a modified EU with a lesser role for elected member-state-politicians, nor to Europhiles who seek to portray the EU as a successful and functionally-democratic institution.  So it is left to those without skin in the game to state the obvious: if European integration is ever to work, European politicians must be beholden to a Europen electorate, not merely a domestic electorate.

Whilst he does utilize ancient Greek Sources, he also makes it a point of referring to archaeological and pictorial evidence from Persia itself, such as the surviving bas-reliefs as Persepolis. He is also fairly balanced in that he objectively describes both the strengths and weaknesses of the Achaemenid army, especially in regards to Greece. Whilst he does advocate the idea that Indo-Europeans originated in the middle-east (which has been disproven with the confirmation that the Yamna Culture as the source of the original migration, I believe), in all other areas he is quite accurate.

Another book in relation to Persian military history is the Achaemenid Persian Army, by Duncan Head. It was published by Montvert, a company that is now out of business, so there are no copyright issues from reading it online here:

https://www.google.com.au/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=HbWUVby3FbDu8weA85awAQ&amp;gws_rd=ssl#q=Achaemenid+Persian+Army+Duncan+Head

In regards to a general political, economic, legal and social examination of the empire, I would suggest Ancient Persia: A Concise History of the Achaemenid Empire, 550-330 B, by Matt Waters:

http://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Persia-Concise-History-Achaemenid/dp/0521253691/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435809619&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Achaemenid+Empire&amp;pebp=1435809624170&amp;perid=1RHRG4ZDSMKK1K15G52T

I similarly have that book and I can assure you it is incredibly informative and very well written, and makes use of a wide range of primary courses from the Iraq/Iran region rather than just relying on Greek authors.",t1_cspioqs,t3_3btynd,0,europe,Ancient and Medieval Warfare | Byzantine History,,3,False,,1437514210,AskHistorians,False,False,0,1435809687,t3_3btynd,cspioqs

0,1,xiipaoc,t5_2w2s8,"I'm going to talk specifically about women in politics, but it applies in general.

The issue here is diversity -- a lack of diversity is *bad*.  It's bad for many reasons, but the main one is that, when it comes to making decisions, your background and who you are affect your choices.  A female legislator is likely to vote differently on, say, reproductive rights (abortion, birth control, etc.) than a male legislator *simply by virtue of having experience being a woman*, which the male legislator has not had (unless he's trans, but that would improve the diversity even more).  An adult woman has spent her entire life dealing with women's reproductive issues, and an adult man probably hasn't.  Reproductive issues are just one set of issues that affects men and woman differently and therefore require women's voices to legislate them.  If you're choosing between two equally qualified candidates and one is a man and the other is a woman, which should you pick?  If your chamber/workplace/whatever is 95% male, you're going to want to go with the woman because that point of view is actually a qualification.  If your chamber is 95% female, you're going to want to go with the man for the same reason.

There's a similar thing going on with minorities in college admissions.  A few years ago, when I was in college (OK, not so few, but not very many either), this was a big deal.  There was a Supreme Court case where my school filed an amicus brief (I think the dean of the Law School did it; I wonder what she's up to now...  Her name was Dean Elena Kagan) saying that diversity is important in admissions.  If I recall correctly, there was some school, possibly in the Midwest, that scored applications using points and awarded points for the applicant's background, and they were sued for discrimination on the basis of race.  I don't remember the outcome of the case.  But the idea was that diversity actually counted for something.  And you know what?  It does.  I got to meet a lot of different people.  I knew people from many countries.  I had friends who were Chinese immigrants.  I had friends who were Southern African-Americans.  I had friends from the Middle East.  I had friends from all over America.  South America.  Europe.  I had a girlfriend for a while who was from Mexico.  Through her, I met people from other parts of Mexico.  I had friends who were conservative.  I had friends who were social justice warrior types (though they weren't called that at the time).  I had friends who wouldn't touch Wagner with a 10-foot pole.  I had friends who played Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries out of their subwoofers at full volume at 2 AM during finals.  I had athlete friends.  I had musician friends.  I had clarinet player friends.  I had violin player friends.  I had percussionist friends.  I had tubist friends...  OK, that one's a lie.  If there's one thing my school failed at, it was recruiting tuba players.  They were in very short supply.  And that's why we need diversity.

(For the record, no, I don't talk to any of those people anymore.  Whoops.)

It's really not about whether they're qualified to do well, take the classes, etc.  It's because meeting a diverse group of people is one of the school's selling points.  It's one of the main reasons why I went there.  (It actually is.)  If the top 2000 applicants are all rich white guys who went to a Northeastern boarding school, why the fuck would *I*, a non-rich Jewish guy who isn't from the Northeast and didn't go to boarding school, want to go there?  A diverse group of students enriches *my* experience.

In any kind of enterprise, we need to recognize that a pure meritocracy isn't actually the best solution to picking people.  You're picking people, entire people, not just test scores.  In a race, the winners are just the ones who finish first.  In a company or a legislature, there's more to it than that.",t1_cspisql,t3_3bqwex,0,points ,5∆,,1,False,,1437514290,changemyview,False,False,0,1435809923,t3_3bqwex,cspisql

LOL.  Sure.  

Buy it using local bitcoins, or an ATM, or use a mixer if you're super paranoid.  But now that you mention it, I'm curious if you can use any pre-paid cards with coinbase or circle to buy coin.  I'll have to try.

As for the fees.  Sure.  Whatever...  

I can buy on Coinbase right now for $260.98, and the lowest spot price per bitcoinwisdom.com right now is 258.29 on BTC-e (a russian site).  I can buy via LocalBitcoin.com and hook me up with somebody near by if I wanted to go that route.  In my area people are asking $265-270 right now.  


 It doesn't cost me anything to send those bitcoin out to my local wallet (except the BTC transaction fee of about a penny).  I've transferred thousands of $USD of BTC purchased on coinbase out to cold storage for long-term speculation and  I haven't paid a dime (well, maybe about a dime, as I transferred to multiple addresses).  How much is a money order going to cost you? Or the fee on a pre-paid Visa card?

When I transferred BTC into AmericasCardRoom I got 100% of my BTC deposited into my account (no fees on their end).  I (sigh) haven't had the chance yet to withdraw BTC from them, but [according to their site there is no withdraw fee using BTC](http://www.americascardroom.eu/play-poker-for-real-money/cashing-out-your-winnings/)

&gt;The __Fairey Swordfish__ was a [torpedo bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo_bomber) [biplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biplane) designed by the [Fairey Aviation Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairey_Aviation_Company) and W.S. Hunt used by the [Fleet Air Arm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_Air_Arm) of the [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy) during the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II). Originating in the 1930s, the Swordfish, nicknamed ""Stringbag"", was an outdated design by the start of the war in 1939, but remained in front-line service until [VE Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day), outliving several types intended to replace it. It was initially operated primarily as a fleet attack aircraft; during its later years it was used as an [anti-submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-submarine_warfare) and [training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainer_(aircraft\)) craft.

&gt; I'd argue that at the point where there's consistently more

&gt; and secondly that as transactions start outright failing (which will

&gt; happen with enough transactions backlogged) the network is

&gt; considered unreliable, the currency illiquid, and there's a virtual

&gt; ""bank rush"" to get into a more usable currency.



The supply and demand fee market means that there is a range of

reliability levels depending on what fee you pay; regardless of how high

demand is if you pay a sufficiently high fee that outbids less

important/lower fee transactions you'll get reliable transaction

confirmaiton.



The perceived lack of reliability is a function of the poor state of

wallet software, not an inherent problem with the system. Fixing that

software is much easier and much less risky than any hard-fork ever will

be.



From my article on transaction fees during the CoinWallet.eu flood:



What needs to be done

=====================



Transaction fees aren't going away, blocksize increase or not. CoinWallet.eu is

only spending $5k flooding the network; even an 8MB blocksize increase can only

raise the cost of that attack to $40k, which is still very affordable. For

instance an attacker looking to manipulate the Bitcoin price could probably

afford to spend $40k doing it with the right trading strategy; let alone

governments, banks, big businesses, criminal enterprises, etc. to whom $40k is

chump-change. Wallets need to become smarter about fees, as does the rest of

the Bitcoin community.



What we need to do:



* Add fee/KB displays to block explorers.



* Change wallets to calculate and set fees in fee/KB rather than fixed fees regardless of tx size.



* Make websites with easy to understand displays of what the current mempool

  backlog is, and what fee/KB is needed to get to the front of the queue. We've

  done a great job for Bitcoin price charts, let's extend that to transaction

  fees.



* Add the ability to set any fee/KB to wallets, rather than be stuck with

  predefined options that may not be high enough.



* Add support for fee-bumping via (FSS)-RBF to wallets and Bitcoin Core.



Capacity limits are just a fact of life in the design of the Bitcoin protocol,

but that doesn't mean we can't give users the tools to deal with them

intelligently.

Hi /r/netsec we are [Include Security](http://www.includesecurity.com/), an expert app assessment consulting shop operated out of NYC with consultants across six countries in North America, EU, and South America.

We're a small shop with a relaxed remote working environment who serve big name clients like large websites, software companies, hardware companies, and also start-ups you've heard of. We do our best to put a different spin on the InfoSec/AppSec consulting game as we put our consultants and clients first and foremost! That means work on your own schedule, work from wherever you want(we've had people submit RCE findings while camping in the French Alps), and we only work with self-directed and responsible senior consultants who consistently show professional results (pay is based on that kind of experience.)

You're right up our ally if you're currently doing security app assessments at another consulting shop and want a better work/life balance, with less client interaction (management handles that), skip all the BS parts of reporting, no sales/marketing/PMs that don't know what they're doing and cause you grief, no multiple layers of management, no bureaucracy, no ""I just broke the Internet and I'm better than you"" egos/attitudes, and more time to hack on stuff during engagements or do whatever you want to do in your down time (yes paid research time is included for our full-time folks.)

Right now we're looking for full-time app hacking experts, and we do mean experts. Experience in finding awesome vulns during web app code reviews is a must, but we also end up doing a fair number of mobile apps, client apps, server apps, APIs, and embedded devices/IoT as well. If your well-researched advisories or bug bounties show up around the web that's a really good sign. That being said, public advisories/bounties are not a requirement, we know there are plenty of good folks in the world who prefer not to publish any of their findings and we'd love to talk to all of you folks as well. We also do a bit of Reversing every now and then and we've had a great experience working with contractors who frequently post on RE and vuln topics on reddit.


If any of this sounds interesting please hit us up with a resume and links to any of your work that might be public or a description of any private research you feel like sharing.

**Pay:** Can vary greatly (skills/experience/etc.), but we are competitive with the better consulting shops.

**Telecommuting:** Yes, almost exclusively.

**Contracting/Full-time:** Our preference is Full-time, if you're awesome and don't want to be a FTE email us anyways.

**Location:** We're looking for folks in -8 GMT through +1 GMT timezones (i.e. N. America, EU, or S. America)

**Clearance:** Nope, we don't work in that field.

**Company Future:** 1) Do cool work with awesome clients 2) Have fun doing it 3) Reinvest profits to GOTO #1. We have no plans to be the next ""small consulting company who used to be awesome and is now ruined by large company bureaucracy"". We love the small consulting company vibe, it suites us well and we plan on keeping that shit up.

**Contact email:** jobs (at) includesecurity [dot] com

And if you're not looking for a new gig right now, no worries. Give us a shout anyways we're always looking to meet-up with hackers at Blackhat/Defcon for a drink.

They also clamour anyone that asks a question on the more realistic scenario of ""What happens if the creditors are not bluffing and will cease negotiating"" they are called fearmongers, germanophiles, pherophone of other interests or the simple response of ""That is not possible.

It plans no nationalizations, its programs aren't even really about reducing inequalities but just keeping them from growing further, it opposes complete destruction of remaining social safety net and at best strengthening it a bit. That is a moderate left. However, as for decades the centre parties across Europe (both so called left and right) consistently stuck to very liberal economic policies, and in fact excluded economic policy from democratic process, now anything a bit left is designated as extreme. If Syriza is extreme left, what were Bolsheviks? Communist parties proper? Hell, even social democrats before 1970s?

Varuifakis does openly declare himself as a Marxist. At the same time, he proclaims his goals as saving capitalism from itself, and consistently acts, or tries to, in that manner. Rational, stemming from his Marxist analysis is that as there is no real left, and it would likely take decades to re-establish it, a crash of capitalism left to its own devices would likely lead to far right (think Orban, Le Pen, BNP and the like) or even extreme right (Golden Dawn, NPD, etc.)

It seems Europe has shifted very much to the right. Not so long ago American political spectrum was shifted significantly to the right compared to Europe. But in less than a decade we caught up.

Now we mostly accept the ""naturalness"" and ""scientificity"" of markets as gospel. Any proposals to reintroduce political economy and political checks on their function is termed populism, while meaningless elections between centre and centre we call democracy. Any, even so slight attempt to preserve the remnants of welfare state is extreme left (to strengthen it would be outright revolution, I guess).

People are not disinterested in politics. On the contrary, it seems that people are getting quite political due to economic crisis. If we exclude arguably the largest influence on our daily life from politics and democratic decision making, we can hardly call what we have democratic except on some symbolic level.

* Right-wingers / neoliberals say the Greeks are lazy and living on other people's money and, as such, deserve the austerity and misery. (for instance, Lucian Mîndruță, Moise Guran)
* Left-wingers say the Greeks are collectively punished and this is destroying the solidarity within the EU. (Vasile Ernu, Claudiu Crăciun)

Nations will slowly lose autonomy as they become increasingly integrated and the treaties between them result in entities larger than a nation. You can see a number of these entities already emerging or emerged over the last century; the USSR and the EU, for example. Just like the formation of nations was full of conflict and many nations fall apart or get redistributed, the rise of these entities is full of conflict, and some of them have already fallen apart, and others probably will in the future.

Will there ever be a single top-level entity? Hard to say.

0,2,Renorei,t5_2qqjc,"While it is true that *too much* of a bottleneck can be harmful, this doesn't at all mean that ""humanity needs more mixing.""  More mixing doesn't always create healthier children, and most human populations are genetically diverse enough that they could continue to mate only within their own population with no adverse effects.     

Take Iceland, for example.  The population of Iceland is *extremely* homogenous.  The founding population had fewer than 50,000 people I believe, and as a result, all modern-day Icelanders are related.  However, Icelanders are a very healthy population on average and have a long life expectancy.  Due to Iceland's history there has also been very thorough genealogy records and lots of cousin marriage.  Icelandic researchers did a study not too long ago in which they determined that the *healthiest* children did *not* come from unions of Icelanders who were the most distantly related.  As a matter of fact, children of third cousins were healthy than the children of more distantly related parents, and also healthier than more closely related parents.     

Also, another interesting tidbit:  European people often carry a gene that predisposes towards heart attack.  However, most European people *also* carry another gene that protects from heart attack, effectively canceling out the harmful gene.  Mixed children from black/white couples often inherit the European heart attack gene, without necessarily inheriting the European protective gene.  As a result, they experience much higher rates of heart attack.  If both parents were white, the child might inherit the heart attack gene, but would almost certainly inherit the protective gene as well.   

So, the claim that ""humans need to mix more"" is just simply not true.  Human populations that already have defects due to inbreeding should make an effort to do some more mixing to reduce their health problems.  But generally healthy populations (which is the case for most populations of humans) have no particular need to do any mixing, and in fact can have healthier children if they don't.

When I got back to the states I had one year left of college and so fate has it my house burned down that I was living in....I lost literally all of my shit and I had to move back on campus...the only space left in student housing was with the international students...most of them were honestly scared an american was going to be living near them...most of them had been there at least 1 year and still had no american friends or ever really talked to any americans...I thought it was really strange so I made it a point to talk to them as much as possible...invite them to parties etc....well one day I got really drunk and went into somebodys room whos door was open...a french girl started yelling at me, telling me to get out and what is wrong w/ me etc....well one thing led to another and we started dating and have been ever since then....

After college ended I wanted to live abroad and be able to be with her but the problem was I received a really good job during my final year in school and I was going to continue working even after graduation which would make it impossible for us to be together...However after a few months my bosses brother came from India and said something terrible had happened and he needed a visa to live in the USA and a job...so since I was on the bottom of the totem pole she told me I should leave....that night I went home and literally had no idea what I should do with my life...so I went on google and typed in what should I do with my life...and I kept seeing teach english abroad...so I looked a little into it and it seemed the Czech Republic was the easiest place for an american to get a visa....so that night I bought a plane ticket there....and 2 weeks later I landed in Prague and have not left since then...

Since being in Prague...I started as an English teacher....then moved onto an office job...and recently got promoted within my job...all this has happened in 2 years....I even just got my 5 year European Union work/living visa last week...I can now live/work anywhere in the EU (except for non-schengen countries)

FA is an European based A3 community, that takes pride in it's ''no-frills'' approach. FA doesn't require you to have mods or you to attend every session. But there are some optional mods that benefit you, like SThud.

Sessions are ran on Sundays and Tuesdays at 20.20 GMT +1. And in our sessions we run 4 or 5 missions, that are mainly infantry based and they last ~30 minutes each, so if you miss the start, you can still jump in the next mission, or if you want to call it a day earlier, there are no obligations to stay for all the missions.

What's more, we are all equal, if you decide to take a leadership role, go ahead, if you just want to be a ground-pounder, then be my guest, before each mission we have a slotting phase when we decide who will be who and after that there is the briefing, where the commander will decide how will we approach the mission. We like to play organized, not lone-wolfing through the thing. And if you don't know something, just ask, people will be happy to explain.

Positive:

+ battery life is as good or better .. but not worse for me
+ performance  is as good as before
+ you can remove finder and quick connect  from the notifications  although  I like it
+ you can disable the background  effect of the wallpaper 
+ in auto  mode of the camera you can now much  easier adjust the exposure (big plus)
+ better camera api 2 and raw support with third party camera apps

Negative:

- it removed my 3rd party icons from the Homescreen.  Maybe I should have switched to the standard theme before updating. But I did an odin update so this problem might not happen when you do an ota update

For me the camera part is the big deal in this update",t1_cspoetl,t3_3bu59x,0,,,,2,False,,1437518359,GalaxyS6,False,False,0,1435826125,t3_3bu59x,cspoetl

&gt;

&gt;The __varicella vaccine__ is a [live (attenuated) virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_vaccine) administered to protect against the viral disease commonly known as [chickenpox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenpox) caused by the [varicella zoster virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_zoster_virus) (VZV). Another vaccine that is known as [zoster vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoster_vaccine) is simply a larger-than-normal dose of the same vaccine used against chickenpox, and is used in older adults to reduce the risk of [shingles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_zoster) (also called herpes zoster) and [postherpetic neuralgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postherpetic_neuralgia), which are caused by the same virus.

&gt;The chickenpox vaccine was developed in 1995. The varicella vaccine is marketed as __Varivax__ in the U.S. by [Merck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_%26_Co.) and globally as __Varilrix__ by [GlaxoSmithKline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline). It is on the [World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization%27s_List_of_Essential_Medicines), a list of the most important medication needed in a basic [health system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system).  In the United States, the [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_Committee_on_Immunization_Practices) (ACIP) issued a recommendation in 2006 for two doses of varicella vaccine to be given universally to children, and it is part of the routine immunization schedule set by the [Centers for Disease Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control) in the US.  Most European countries include it as part of universal vaccinations in children,  but not all countries provide the vaccine due to its cost.  In the UK, the vaccine is currently only recommended in people who are particularly vulnerable to chickenpox.

People are as crazy about borrowing here as anywhere. People with decent incomes will borrow $10 for lunch and cannot pay back because of their massive loans on stuff they don't need.

If you want to protect full time shop staff, then there are many ways you can do that which does not require you to shut on Sundays: Legislate extra pay; legislate maximum working hours; give strong protections for staff to designate off days and give full time employees preferential access to demand Sunday and/or Saturday off.

0,1,Blahallon,t5_2qh4j,"&gt; Plus, I wouldn't have to pay property sale or inheritance taxes

We have a property fee (that was just raised rather substantially here in Stockholm btw)  which is similar to property taxes. Also, all the time when you didn't pay taxes, up until 2009, we had higher taxes. And we had property and inheritance tax in the 70's, 80's and 90's. Removed in 2002 I believe. While Greece were receiving money from the EU - *we* were selling our childhood homes..

&gt;If I were to earn more than 50000 my income would get taxed by 33% rather than 26%, but I would still pay the same fixed amount in business taxes and social security

We would pay 58 % taxes then........And - why have you built a system that does that then?  

&gt;Also: Shipping companies are taxed by 0%

Yes, I know. It is **idiotic**. Who in their fucking right mind vote for a system like that? At some point the Greeks voted for it. Why did you Greek people create a system like that? And, btw, we are taxing our industry. So, your industry should not be taxed according to the Greeks but ours shall? Is that fair? 

Why did you? Why did you, since 1973, vote for a system like that? Why didn't you build up a proper taxing system, and why did you take our money with no problems why we paid more taxes?

The Baltic states didn't exist when Greece got their freedom, and when they joined the EU. They however are now paying towards you!. And, they pay taxes and have taken a steel bath. They are not overly impressed either with paying towards Greece. They earn less btw, but are far better at tax paying. 

The Greeks want more money but you haven't bothered to improve your system which is admittedly, a clusterfuck and you have received money for *decades* from us. Decades.  It pisses me off, frankly. Can't you see that? 

&gt;So poor people pay way more taxes than affluent people. Isn't that degrading

No, it isn't. It depends on the levels. It is the case in the US for example. Usually in a lot of system the middle class is the most heavily taxed. I belive that might be the case in Spain and Ireland for example, and Canada.  And if you don't like **your** tax system - change it! It is up to you.  But the fact is that you have a nutty system and the EU have been trying to get you to simplify it, and have less tax evasion - for decades! Why haven't you? You can't claim that the EU created your tax system.


You Greeks created this system, with tax evasion, no land registry, no tax for shipping, rampant corruption, pension, low VAT -all this shit. You Greeks did it against advice of the EU, even. All the while receiving our high taxed money. And then you say it is *degrading* to pay taxes to the level (or actually not, still lower) that we do. Dear God, that is rich. I think it is degrading that you have used and abused our money for all those years. 

And - what more.If we look forward.  Why should we trust you guys now?  Tax evasion is still rampant and it is clear that you do not want to pay taxes on our level and Greece is still corrupt. The Greeks do not trust Greece. My money would just go into a black hole, wouldn't it? If you guys generally evade taxes, and wont tax your industry - why should our tax money go to Greece? Even if I belive in you personally - do you think my money would be wisely spent? I doubt it. 


&gt;The Greek government proposed an additional temporary tax (8%) for corporate incomes over 500000 euros, and Eurogroup refused.

Stupid. They Eurogroup has done many mistakes and the Euro is not correctly constructed. I certainly will not defend them. They are in many ways idiots. 


&gt; And what Europe chooses to debate on is whether VAT will be raised by two percentage points or not? That's the problem

12 %, on the islands, Eurogroup wanted the same everywhere (22 % I belive, we have 25 %) Btw, Sweden have around 200 000 islands (all along the coast, thank you latest ice age) and over 1000 of them are inhibited. We do not have lower taxes for them, or the people there. And, it can be hard living there in the winter, trust me. 


And, I personally belive it is bad for Greece to be in the Euro. I think Greece have a much better shot at a decent recovery with the drachma. We do know about the low pension and the unemployment you know. Our papers write about that all the time. And about lower wages. I understand it is not easy. But you did create this mess. It is not like we did. The only thing we did was give you money. 

But, maybe you have a shot at fixing your system with the drachma. Also, you will not have debt, the one you have right now is unsustainable. Everyone know that, but again, it is not exactly OK to go to the northern Europeans and say ""Gee, pay off Greece's debt so they have a far lower one than you do, while we raise the taxes a bit more to pay off theirs and ours"". Do you guys realise what Greece looks like sometimes? 

So - I wish you the best of luck, honestly, in the vote, and if you go for the drachma. 

But I am personally tired of contributing to the Greeks. Solidarity is a two way street. If we pay towards you - then improve and fix things. And  I don't see that, I am sorry.  I really don't think most of you realise how bad it looks to the rest of Europe, and what we feel when we realise what our money have been subsidising. So, maybe this will be a new start, a clean slate for you. Good luck, I really mean that.

Albania was annexed in 1917, then lost in '20. They ceded the Dodecanese to Greece in exchange for a chunk of British East Africa in 1925. They took another shot at Ethiopia and annexed it in '36, Albania in '39. The various colonies were largely occupied by the Allies before Italy switched sides in WW2 in 1943 and they formally lost them in 1947.

As to why they didn't have a colonial empire before that, Italy didn't exist at all before 1861, and still had a ways to go to achieve their stated goal of uniting all of ""Italy,"" a rather larger area than the modern country of that name.

Well, first and foremost I'd say if you think you might fit-in here, your best bet would be just to join up.... it's not like we can force you to stay if you decide we're not the corp for you!

 I've become reluctant to bombard people with walls of text about how super awesome we are, because at the end of the day words are cheap, and if i'm honest most corps offer much of a muchness in terms of actual features. we've got an srp, voice comms, loot buyback program etc all checkboxed.... just like anywhere else. 

Also, the thing i find that makes the most difference between a ""good"" corp vs a ""bad"" one is the social interactions. Which is something that you can't really sell when you're trying to recruit someone unless you've known them for a long time.  

That said, if you're looking for the sales pitch, the most common things i get asked about are:

* We don't particularly have any activity requirements (if you don't log in for months you might get booted, but there's nothing to stop you rejoining) 
* We have people from all over the globe, but are strongest in the us and eu timezones
* We are first and foremost an exploration corp, that said plenty of people do other odds and ends aswell
* The corp is nominally based in thera, but you don't have to relocate there if you don't want to. 
* There's no mandatory mining ops etc, the corp is funded via an (optional) look buyback program which pays (iirc) jita -10% rates, aswell as from generous donations from people who support what we do.
* If you're looking for any meaningful kind of pvp, i'd suggest looking elsewhere. The section on the about us page of the website about not hating pvp is filled with lies .... we totally hate pvp!

Look at this situation from global point of wiev. Some guy break down because of trobles at work, he did not think straigth, but he could be helped. Instead he riddled with bullets, his family ruined, and everyone fine with that.
He doesn't even have a real gun. He doesn't do violent rampages through city. He just sick man, and need help.

You should watch documentary series ""Norden"" about norvegian prisons and police (english). They point out difference in views on this issue. In Europe police/prisons try to help people, if you done something wrong, its not the end, everyone make mistakes. It is not a reason to end this person life. In US, in contrast, if you break the law, you put it on youself, and you will suffer.

0,1,upvotesthenrages,t5_2qh13,"&gt; 35% of US Debt is owned by Foreign Countries. Of the 65% remaining, over 50% is held by Multinational Companies which, to be honest, have no real allegiance to nation-states. American Exceptionalism is a thin argument.

Simply not true. over 45% is owned by US government institutions (Social Security, Federal Reserve, &amp; other federal entities).

But other than that, you just proved my point. So while the vast majority of Greek debt is owned by foreigners, it's the minority of the US debt.

&gt;The EU is about the same as the US. In fact, the potential economy is about 70% larger than the US on account of the population. Currently it is the same sort of size in market terms.

The EU is not a country. The US has 100% control over the dollar and the US economy, the EU doesn't have 100% control over the Euro - only the Euro nations have control over it, and each nation doesn't control the financial policy of other nations, despite having the same currency.

&gt;Those devaluations generally happened as a consequence of Banking Crises or in response to aggressive Banking practices. The Euro could be devalued in proportion to any one of the Member States - which is part of the mechanism of convergence. The US Dollar is as unstable as the Euro for the same reason: it ranges across a huge variety of different state economies.

The US dollar is one of the most stable currencies on the planet, which is caused because it's so big. The same thing is close to happening with the Euro.

It's huge size is one of the factors that cause it's stability. The big problem is when it actually destabilizes, since it's so big that there is nobody to ask for help.

But they have been devaluing for a very long time, you can't blame it all on banking.

&gt;The point of the Bailout was that it was not a bailout of Greece. In 2008 Greece was being instructed to privatise everything not nailed down and give the capital to the Banks. Quite sensibly the Greeks said, we do not need to do that. Who would sell assets at rock bottom prices (remember: Banks had no capital because of their liquidity crisis)? It is no excuse - lame or otherwise.

I completely agree. But if they weren't going to sell, and they weren't going to cut down expenses, and increase tax revenue, then the people they borrowed money off of won't get their money - and Greece goes bankrupt.

&gt;The Greeks were given 10% of the bailout funds they asked for. The other 90% was given to Banks. Essentially to recapitalise the banks. The Capital given to Greece was immediately extracted from the Economy by those same Banks.

Again... If I borrow money from you, and I don't have money to repay you - when I then borrow money to repay you, that's not the same as ""giving away my money"". I'm giving back money that I borrowed, willingly....

&gt;The largest deficit ratio in 70 years? Not really. The UK Deficit ratio was higher.

No it wasn't, not over a longer period. If what you are saying were true, then the UK would also owe 170% of it's GDP to mainly foreign interests - which it doesn't. Same with the US. You are partially correct with Ireland, which is *exactly* why they were one of the economies who were also hit extremely hard.

&gt;The money owed by the Greek Banks was owed to the Greek People. The Money owed by the Greek People was owed to other Greek People. The European Investment Fund and European Central Bank money was - before the bailout of the Banks - investment money not some kind of magical party cash.

Simply not true. The Greek banks owed huge amounts of money to other European banks. When you borrow money, you have to pay that money back, that's how it works.

&gt;The truth is that the only reason 90% of the 2010-2012 Bailout went to the Banks is because drumroll the Banks were insolvent and needed to charge extortionate rates to even break even. Yet, they still managed to pay dividends. Greece cut 60% of the economy to obtain that Bailout.

I'm sure that Greece said ""ok"" to pay money that it never borrowed. Your arguments are so impeccably true, that an entire nation chose to bankrupt itself for absolutely no reason, other than the benefit of foreign banks.

&gt;20 October 2009 – Greece's budget deficit reached 12.5%. Still less than the US Budget Deficit. 23 December 2010 – Greece’s parliament approved the 2011 (Fourth) Austerity Budget. 12 February 2012 – The Fifth austerity package is passed. Greeces budget deficit is now 135%. In three years of Austerity, the Economy failed. They did not borrow too much money. They cut too much of the economy for it to be sustainable.

Those are extreme numbers when you have already run a deficit for 2 decades. Look at the [stats](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=teina200), and Google for previous numbers.

All the nations that are having huge issues, except for the UK, have had huge deficits.

You can't borrow money forever, and when shit hits the fan, expect the people you borrowed money from to sit and hope for the best, when they themselves are now on the verge of bankruptcy.

&gt;The only reason each of the Austerity packages (five in three years) were approved was because Greece managed to create a budget surplus.

No they didn't. Their deficit was ~10% every year. I think you need to look up the definition of the word surplus.

&gt;If you owe me $90 and the Bank lends you $100 - you now owe $190 Dollars. Why the hell did you think borrowing money would get you out of debt? If you then give me the $90 then only 10% of the money went to your pocket. You still owe $100.

Yes, that is very true. The big difference being that if I borrow money and promise to pay you back after 1 year, then you expect that money. When I then borrow the $100 so I can repay you, I get another 1 year extension.

You are of course hoping that when it's time to pay back the borrowed money, times will have changed, and now you make more money - this isn't the case with Greece, which has had huge issues collecting tax revenue, fighting corruption, and running a huge deficit for decades.",t1_cspq57j,t3_3bomts,0,,,,1,False,,1437519753,worldnews,False,False,0,1435833558,t1_csor26n,cspq57j

0,8,TheJoshider10,t5_30cz1,"Then we need Rocket League: The Movie!

I could see that working incredibly well as well. We get some world building going on with how people in the world live their life, and it's a mix between Blade Runner, Deus Ex and Avatar in aesthetic and how people live. 

We follow a guy with skill who's been playing Rocket League (which is a big worldwide sport with it's own merchandise) toys, games and even driving a Rocket League car with his dad, all his life. 

His dad then dies but his final words are for his son to go pursue his dream to go to the Rocket League. He couldn't do so before as he had to stay at home to look after his dad, working long hours to afford to live. His dad saved up so much money over the years that now he can live for a while without work in order to pursue his dream. 

He then goes to Rocket League Trials, absolutely slaying it, before he gets into the top 20 of the Trials for the year, allowing him to be selected in a draft where the 20 Rocket League teams pick who to have. 

Despite being one of the most talented, he ends up being selected for the team dead last. The member that he's replacing was the most talented and left the club for one of the top teams, destroying the morale of the team. He's a bit let down this is what he has, but we get to know the 3 teammates as the film goes on and ultimately the 4 of them form a great bond (with him having a thing for his teammate, but can't progress this because they're focused on Rocket League). A cheesy 80s training montage is here showing how the team progress and get better as the film goes on. 

Ultimately we see that they win some, lose some, but they always remain a unit. Their aim is to get top 10 as that takes you to the Rocket League world championships in Europe, which truly decides who is the best. The domestic league is seen as a way to get the best teams ready for the world championships, but to teams like the one the main guy is in, it's vital and boosts the squad massively. 

Ultimately final game of the season against the best team in the league (and of course, it cliche cheesy fashion the teammate who left them is with the leaders). The team need to hold out for a draw against these fuckers in order to gain top 10 status and make it to the world championships. We see a full 5 minute battle where in the final seconds the worst player on the team makes a key save which grants the team a solid draw and takes them up. Celebrations ensue, and the protagonist smiles as he realises he's made his father proud by becoming a pro Rocket League player. 

What's next for these guys, well, that's for Rocket World to decide;)

The film would have 3 full battles, one to kick off the film (the team the protagonist supports), one in the middle (the team lose) and one at the end (the draw). Plenty of goals and saves with many references to the game (maybe a little joke about how the PS4 exclusive vehicle got destroyed because exclusivity rights ran out or something, as the film will obviously be available to everyone and not just a console fanbase).

Canada pretty much mooches security, too.  They know if any nation seriously harmed their populace we'd slaughter whoever did it.  

The real problem with the free ridership isn't the capability.  

It's the fundamental resentment it builds politically.  The US voting populace that factors in security issues into their decision making looks very critically at Europe. 

On peacekeeping outside Europe, every NATO country voted yes for a Libya mission (with Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, and SA Total clearly influencing a war for oil in a way Iraq never was), followed by *half* of the alliance not participating.  

Not because they weren't willing; the capability just *wasn't there*.

Totally impotent - no way to logistically get together a *tiny* naval-air operation against *northern Africa*, right on the doorstep, against a technologically obsolete force so close that boat-people can make it by the thousands with good weather. 

EU NATO members straight up ran out of munitions.

It's not like they were fighting against Russia to maintain territorial integrity in a doomsday situation.  This was a 'stomp on Islamists who barely have 21at century hardware' style fight.  


Romania, Poland, Estonia, etc.  They don't look to the powerful economies and technological abilities of their German (or other large European) neighbors.  They look to *us*, a world away when the Russians threaten them.  

So when news breaks that the NSA spies on European leaders and industry, or that we ask for newer entrants to host detention facilities, the US public basically says ""so fucking what?"" 

When our Congress pushes trade bills that seek to make your nations' leaders capitulate to our interests, the US public basically thinks ""good, it's not like they manage their own transnational finances and trade well anyway"" 

And frankly, if in the next 20-30 years there is a confrontation with China, can the US rely on Europe to do anything? To be *able* to do anything?  

That we constantly have to subsidize European security makes us callous to espionage against it, economic bullying against it, and deprioritizes cooperation in favor of unilateral approaches.  



When we constantly look out for EU interests via NATO we get the feeling those interests aren't just alligned with US ones - we feel like we should *make them US interests*.

But that was not enough for me, I want to become one of the best players in this game. Also I really enjoy the strategic part of MOBAs, so I started to watch competetive tournaments, analyse my own aswell as pro replays, learn all the heroes and their skills, teamcomps etc.
I've also played with people who got a lot of experince already so I improved through that aswell. I basically have enough knowledge about the game by now and also the needed mechanics to compete at the highest level.

**What I'm looking for:** I'm looking for a team/people who take the game as serious as I do and also want to be competetive and play in tournaments/cups consistently, improve and become a top team eventually.",t1_cspqh3y,t3_3buwm3,0,,,,1,True,,1437520043,CompetitiveHotS,False,1436394435,0,1435834894,t3_3buwm3,cspqh3y

0,1,nomanoid,t5_2qh9i,"A contradição, pra mim, é muito clara. Ela diz que não segue nenhuma tendência. Segundo ela, compra as roupas porque gosta, ou precisa. Mas, logo em seguida, afirma que deixa de comprar determinados produtos quando eles se popularizam demais. Querendo ou não, mesmo que seja uma espécie de contra-tendência, por assim dizer, isso não deixa de ser uma tendência, no sentido de que não é apenas o gosto pessoal dela que pesa na balança no momento da compra. 

Aí eu comecei a pensar sobre os motivos que levam ela a seguir essa tendência, que não se admite como tal. Concordo com você, quem gosta de moda e leva o vestuário mais a sério, procura sempre se expressar de alguma maneira através das roupas que adquire e usa no dia a dia. O meu problema com a entrevistada não é que ela queira fazer um fashion statement qualquer, até porque os próprio rolezeiros também estão nessa mesma onda, assim como qualquer outra tribo, como você bem disse. O meu problema é o statement que ela quer fazer. 

Na minha opinião, se ela deixa de comprar as roupas apenas porque os produtos estão se tornando populares, é porque ela quer passar uma ideia de superioridade, que normalmente as pessoas eufemizam como ""exclusividade"". Acho natural, quando se têm bastante dinheiro, querer adquirir produtos de luxo. Da mesma forma que eu acho natural, quando não se têm bastante dinheiro, querer adquirir produtos de luxo. 

Sabe aqueles caras da África, que usam só os [melhores ternos do mundo](https://www.google.com.br/search?q=sapeur&amp;rlz=1C1VASM_enBR531BR531&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=941&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hR2VVZSbL4SoNv2rgogN&amp;ved=0CB8QsAQ)? Pois então, pra mim, essa jornalista age como se nenhum outro homem pudesse mais usá-los, a partir do momento em que essa tendência caísse no gosto popular, porque os ternos teriam, neste momento, ""caído um pouco de nível"". 

Na visão dela, um homem realmente ""chique"", teria de procurar produtos menos populares e passar a comprar outras marcas, ainda mais luxuosas, para manter o quê exatamente? A conclusão que eu chego é: o senso de superioridade. É isso que eu acho nojento. 

Mas, você tem razão. Não sei se é isso mesmo que ela quis dizer. É que eu acho válido criticar mesmo assim, porque se não ela, a gente sabe que existem outras trocentas pessoas que pensam dessa maneira. E eu acho esse raciocínio muito distorcido. Mesmo que ela não tenha ""pobrefobia"", no mínimo ela deixou escapar ali uma contradição, quando disse que não segue nenhuma tendência. E a conclusão a que eu cheguei, juntando os pontos (apesar de que eu admito que foi um tanto quanto especulativa) é que ela precisa dizer que não segue tendência nenhuma, porque se fosse instada a explicar qual tendência exatamente ela segue, ia pegar mal pra caralho.

However, megashub beat me to this by 3 hours (that's what I get for sleeping instead of staying on reddit).

So instead my unique answer will be **High Frontier** - which I am watching kickstarter for the 3rd Edition launch - or **Origins: How We Became Human** or **Bios: Megafauna** (okay, I really like Sierra Madre Games).

I'm not a fan of app-driven games, but I could see a High Frontier deluxe edition with a ""High Frontier Travel App"" that would be akin to google maps or the like.  Instead, you could put in your cards in your rocket stack, start location, destination, waypoints in order, and select one way or round trip then get the optimal path with a few alternate paths and possible suggestions with higher and lower risk (radiation die roll/airbrake) paths.  With it I'd love to see flags (to represent claims), clear or player color coded stands to put most models on (so you can see the board underneath), rocket models based on thrusters (or maybe even some ""click together"" models where you can assemble a series of parts into your ship), a large laminated poster map in a tube and a smaller mounted map (I know some people really like mounted boards, but I have all the cracks and irregular surfaces of almost all folded boards), and so on.

Origins could equally be interesting, with custom sculpts of your people on the board instead of cubes (okay, I don't own this one yet - really need to sink some money into acquiring this soon).

Bios Megafauna?  Sculps of dinosaurs and mammal archetypes for each player (4 x 4 = 16 different sculpts), bases like in Mansions of Madness for sculpts of invasive species drawn, a larger map, a nice drawbag or two (for mesozoic and cenezoic era), two boards (well, four - a game board with Africa and Europe zones that slide away to emphasize they become separated by an ocean and a roadrunner gene/size board), octagonal tiles (which would then have built into them a predator trapezoid and then maybe a rooter trapezoid zone clearly market on the tile), basic land/ocean octagonal tiles (which would fill the empty spaces and could be flipped based on CO2 levels), translucent glacier/desert octagonal tiles (to lay over red and blue star tiles when CO2 levels are too low/high), and so much more.  Oh, and definitely hire artists to render fairly realistic full color art (along the lines of Evolution and Flight for their colorfulness and quality).

The stability of the currency is not a problem. In fact, the optimal path is to devalue the currency to make Greece more competitive in international markets and reduce the cost of running the government. They are unable to do this with the euro. They would be in just as bad shape with the dollar. With their own currency, they can devalue it, take a hit to GDP, and then undercut on trade prices pretty much everybody in the Eurozone which will jumpstart their economy (after all, the human capital hasn't changed and their infrastructure hasn't changed--only their credit has changed). Continuing with the Euro, their only option is to continue to cut back on the government and watch unemployment soar as they try to make debt payments with an overall economy that continues to shrink and which requires larger social services benefits.

Contrast what the US did in 2008 and 2009. The US took a massive amount of debt and stopped the recession in about half the time as most of Europe. Now the US economy has recovered and is growing strong. Unemployment is nearly at pre-recession levels. This was because the US controlled its currency. Greece couldn't do this. Italy couldn't do this. Spain could do this. And these countries are suffering still.

&gt; Approval of a fresh tranche from an existing bailout is relatively easy. It requires a single sign-off by eurozone governments. But a new bailout requires two separate decisions — each of which trigger parliamentary votes in several eurozone countries, including Germany.
First, the European Commission needs to evaluate the bailout request. Officials said an evaluation was under way. One of the criteria the commission must consider is whether there is “a risk to the financial stability of the euro area as a whole, or of its member states”.
Once the commission completes its evaluation, eurozone finance ministers must decide whether to start negotiations. For Germany, this requires a Bundestag vote. Eurozone officials said any such decision was unlikely until after Sunday’s Greek referendum.
If the eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers agree to start talks, another round of approvals is needed to sign off on the programme’s terms — the so-called “conditionality” that has held up negotiations over the last bailout for nearly a year. For Germany and others, this would require another parliamentary vote.  
&gt; ...  
&gt; But senior EU leaders have put the vote in much starker terms, saying a No vote would mean Greek exit from the eurozone. That may sound like overheated political rhetoric but given the time and difficulty in negotiating a bailout, many officials believe a No will make it impossible to complete before July 20 — the date Greece is due to pay €3.5bn to the European Central Bank.
A default could force the central bank to cut all emergency funding to Greek lenders, bankrupting them. They would be unable to reopen without a new currency.

1. Make your ruler a military leader.
2. Take mission ""Improve our Prestige!"".
3. Rival the Ottomans.
4. Break vassalization of Athens.
5. Delete two of your infantry regiments in Constantinople.
6. Fabricate a claim on Burgas.
7. Start building galleys in each of your three provinces.
8. Unpause.
9. Send one of your infantry regiments in your capital to Achaea with your fleet.
10. You have one (1) barque. Send it to the straits of Otranto.
11. Send your main fleet back to Constantinople.
12. Order your main fleet to patrol between Constantinople and the Sea of Marmara.
11. Attack Albania with the Reconquest CB.
12. Wait a couple of months until your war score allows you to vassalize Albania. Do it.
13. The next years are going to be very tough for the Albanians. Apologize to them.
14. You are now the war leader against the Ottomans. Scorch earth in Achaea and Constantinople.
15. Invade Anatolia with your stack consisting of 1k infantry and 1k cavalry. The Ottomans may still have a leaderless 1k cavalry regiment in Anatolia. Destroy it. Once Anatolia is free of Turkish troops, split your 2k stack and send the infantry regiment back to Constantinople.
16. Loot Anatolia with your horse and use the money to build more galleys in all your provinces. Keep building galleys until your total fleet numbers at least 20 ships; up to 25 are preferable.
17. When the Ottomans are done sieging Albania, they'll send their 17k fleet to the Ionian Sea to blockade Achaea. Normally, the Ottomans would send their fleet to the Bosporus; however, since a single looting regiment like yours in Turkey isn't interpreted as a danger by the AI - which is true, as one regiment is not enough to siege a province - they are perfectly content with blockading the nearest port.
18. The two main stacks of the Ottomans are now patiently waiting in Epirus, Athens, Silistra and/or Edirne for the Scorched Earth modifier to end. If you had more than one regiment stationed in Constantinople or Achaea, they would attack without second thought. However, the Ai doesn't consider killing 1 regiment worth entering a province that has been scorched. Keep an eye on the Scorched Earth modifier and immediately re-scorch the two provinces as soon as it disappears.
19. Repeat step 16 and 18 until you have enough galleys to challenge the Ottoman fleet.
20. Equip your galleys in Achaea with an admiral. Recruit a naval reformer if you have one available.
21. Send your galleys in Morea to Constantinople and merge them with your main fleet.
22. Send your main fleet to the Ionian Sea to stomp the Ottoman ships. As soon as your fleet enters the Sea of Crete, the Ottoman ships will retreat. Use your galleys in Achaea to intercept them until your main fleet comes to the rescue a couple of days later.
23. Victory (despite their likely god-like naval leader)! Rebuild galleys if you suffered big losses.
24. Blockade all Ottoman ports. Be careful though - the AI tend to rebuild ships too.
25. Build four (4) infantry regiments in Constantinople. Send them to Anatolia one by one. Don't forget to keep an infantry unit in your capital for scorching duties.
26. Use your four infantry units to siege two provinces at a time. Do not siege Kutahya. Continue looting with your horse for good measure.
27. Peasant revolts will sooner or later emerge in the provinces you just occupied. Open the diplomacy window and use ""Support rebels"" to, well support them. Give them as little money as possible. They are now on your side and will refuse to siege the provinces occupied by you. Let them have Kutahya. If the Ottomans discover your rebel support, support them again.
28. With their armies trapped in Europe, there's little the Ottomans can do. The same is true for you too - you can't enter Europe just yet. Keep sieging provinces and Wait for their war exhaustion rise. With half of their country occupied and 100% blockaded ports, WE should accumulate fairly quickly.
29. Keep an eye on the military ledger. With their country in such a disastrous state, the Ottomans won't be able to sustain their economy forever, eventually leading to bankruptcy. Their entire army will be disbanded when they go bankrupt. Now's your time to strike!
20. Enter the Balkans with your units. The AI knows how to use harsh treatment, so there's a good chance there are no Greek/Orthodox rebels yet. However, harsh treatment gets nullified if the harshly treated province gets occupied by somebody else. Siege Edirne and when you're done with it, wait for rebels to appear there and let them do the dirty work for you.
21. Meanwhile, you can reconquer Athens.
22. Do not, under any circumstances, retake Albania. Lifting the occupation of Albania will make the nasty ""Call for Peace!"" modifier appear. Be patient and wait for rebels to spawn and your provinces to defect to you.
23. If Albanian patriots or orthodox zealots spawn in Albania, you're out of luck since they are considered friendly troops so you can't fight them. If the ""Call for Peace!"" modifier appears and turns into a problem and Greek patriots still haven't shown up, siege Greece yourself and take what's yours in the peace deal.
 
In any case, the Turks are now devastated and with your new strength you should have an easy time restoring the Roman Empire.
 
Pro tips:
Rhodes might defect to you all by itself. If the Mamluks snatch Cyprus - and they usually do - they'll probably fabricate a claim on Rhodes and attack you. Make sure your fleet is large enough to counter theirs. This is an easy war that will allow you to reconquer your core Cyprus.
Remember how we fabricated a claim on Burgas? If Bulgarian nationalists appear and free Bulgaria from the shackles of the Ottoman Empire, attack and vassalize them ASAP. Return their cores in the peace deal with the Ottomans should the war score allow it.
The Anatolian beyliks are very likely to fabricate tons claims on the Ottomans.

Look at how massive the effects of this crisis are on Greece, relative to Germany. Greece is the party that is being driven by desperation, and that will probably have to swallow a deal in the end that will hurt a great amount, simply because they are being left with no other option. German public opinion doesn't like the idea of spending money on Greece, but that's a vague dislike, not a question of economic survival. From an outside perspective (much closer to Germany than Greece, by the way), the extortion looks like it's going the opposite way. Merkel has much more room to make concessions than Tsipras, but her government is insisting on policies that are absolutely unacceptable to Greece.

Imagine this: Tsipras has already given in on almost every major point, but all he wants are some window-dressing concessions from Germany on small technicalities (like the timeline of pension cuts) so that he doesn't have to go back home empty handed. His government came to power with a mandate to fundamentally change the paradigm from one of austerity to one of investment coupled to reform. But Tsipras has completely given up on that mandate, and is now simply haggling over the terms of further austerity. Merkel has already won, from that standpoint. But her government is still unwilling to make even the minor alterations to the new austerity program that Tsipras needs to make it palatable to his domestic political constituency. The inescapable conclusion is that the German government wants to humiliate Syriza, and thus bring about a change in the Greek government.

That's the context of the events that are playing out now.

0,9,Naurgul,t5_2qh4j,"&gt; If [Prime Minister Alexis] Tsipras had set out in January to take Greece out of the eurozone, it is very hard to think of anything he would have done differently

I can think of a few things. He met the creditors' demands all the way by proposing 8 billion euros of austerity measures and in return they only asked that the measures are somewhat redistributive and they get some debt relief assurances. 

Does that sound like the proposition of people hell bent on exiting the euro? 

&gt; not realizing that he's already won.

They have won what exactly? They have put all their political capital at stake supporting the referendum option that is the most likely to lose. They have given the creditors an easy way to kick them out. All the creditors need to do is put enough pressure on Greeks to vote yes and then Syriza is gone and they can return to business as usual. 

If Syriza truly wanted to exit the euro, they would never have done that. 

Also, what about Varoufakis? He has been saying the same things for the past 5 years: adopt a confrontational negotiation stance until Greece gets a reasonable deal but try not to exit the euro. His connection to Syriza started years after he had started saying those things. 

For this particular conspiracy theory to work, Varoufakis must have been playing an extremely long con. 

&gt; Suppose senior government officials in Greece had concluded that the euro was a failed experiment, that the rest of the continent would never extend reasonable terms to their country and would instead doom it to perpetual recession, and that the only way to save Greece from disaster -- and Europe, too -- was to begin the process of unwinding the common currency.

There is some truth in that, but I think it's a bit backwards. The officials in Greece have indeed concluded that the euro is a failed experiment. That is true. So they think that courageous policy change is needed to fix that. They have also concluded that under normal circumstances the rest of the continent would not extend reasonable terms to their country and would instead doom it to perpetual recession. That is also true. 

So what is the plan? To begin the process of unwinding the common currency. Yes. But to what end? The Syriza logic here, right or wrong I can't tell, is that when the process of unwinding the common currency starts, the politicians of Europe would be jolted by a heavy dose of reality and that would induce them to stop kicking the can down the road and instead actually sit down and start solving the Eurozone's problems. 

To put it another way, they bet that if they removed the option to kick the can down the road and confronted the others with a dilemma - allow the Eurozone to start disintegrating or push forward in a genuine attempt to fix the Eurozone - the creditors would choose the latter. 

What we're now learning is that the other Eurozone countries may well choose the former. ",t1_cspvgt4,t3_3bvecx,0,,,,9,False,,1437524060,europe,False,False,0,1435847382,t3_3bvecx,cspvgt4

What makes you think that the South would be any different?

&gt; Second, the South is motivated, and the North is not. If the South were to break away, it would be because the population has a great desire for their own independence. People in the north have no great motivation to keep the union together. I doubt that there would even be a fight.

Considering the absence of any polls asking: ""would you allow another part of the country to secede""? I have no way to argue this. I suspect its not true, though.

&gt; Third, if there was a fight, the outcome would be totally different than the first time. The South is in a much better position to defend itself than it was in the 1800's.

Based on what, their numbers in the military? Number of armed citizens? I would counter by arguing that all of America's defense manufacturing infrastructure is located outside of the South. Our aerospace stuff is largely in Southern California, armored vehicles are made in Ohio, and most of our domestic gun manufacturers are located in New England.

&gt; he large population centers of the North would be more of a disadvantage than an advantage in a modern war.

Why?

&gt; Fourth, the only plausible way that the North could ""attack"" the South would be economically, but that could leave both countries in an economic ruin. There is just simply too much to lose to risk starting an economic war.

The South has a few strong industries, (oil and gas, manufacturing) but the North has a far more diverse economy. I think they would last longer.

You're also ignoring the international relations angle. Our allies in Europe have issues with their own separatist movements, for that reason alone they would do everything they could to avoid supporting the new country (trade embargoes, sanctions, etc.). Hell, this may even allow the U.S. government to invoke NATO's mutual defense clause and bring their militaries into the fight.

**Weapons**
--------------------------

**Katana**

The common curved blade katana you will see in movies/art today are produced through a method of primarily folding and differentially heating layers of steel – these katana were first really seen during the end of the Heian period or start of the Kamakura. I could expand on the actual method of creating these blades, but for now just understand that through differential heating, the blade was able to retain a sharp edge whilst being flexible enough to not break on impact. The steel itself, through the differential heating, formed two materials of different densities (due to the speed of the cooling), giving the blade its famous curve and hamon, the wavy bit you see in the middle of the blade. Bear in mind that this broad technique of quenching the steel at different speeds was not invented and used for the first time by Japanese swordsmiths – it has been seen elsewhere in the world, notably in Damascus/wootz steel. 

The earlier, pre-Kamakura period swords were called chokuto, and were [straight, one-handed swords]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Japanese_straight_swords_6th_7th_century_Kofun_period.jpg), however it was soon discovered that blades with a curve were faster to be drawn, and when slicing or slashing, especially from horseback, and so new swords were designed to incorporate a larger angle of curvature in the blade. These pre-katana-esque swords however proved to be rather brittle, demonstrated first in the Mongol invasions of Japan. The Japanese found out that more often than not they would have to dismount and resort to melee than to use arrows, however due to the earlier techniques of swordsmithing (remember the different types of steel in the blade), the wider overall blade of the pre-katanas chipped soon after bashing on armour. I can’t seem to find a decent picture anywhere, however it’s important to know that the pre-katanas had much wider edges in comparison to their European contemporaries, and so they broke often, and in many places.

To compensate for the fragility, as well as the development of better technologies, smiths and warriors both began to adapt to better use these weapons. They made thinner edges whilst retaining the sharpness and hardness, at the same time maintaining the soft body of the blade to allow it to bend instead of break. From this point onwards (think 13th century onwards), these katanas were essentially the only ‘sword’ that was produced by Japan. 

Following the Sengoku Jidai and Tokugawa Ieyasu’s unification of Japan and establishment of the Edo period, swords were more status symbols than anything else (however, it is important to note that swords were still never a staple of the Japanese army or samurai). Increasingly elaborate techniques were used to make the swords beautiful, decorative, but in terms of an actual sword, more useless. This isn’t all due to the fact that the swords were a status symbol – it’s also due to the fact that, throughout most of the Sengoku Jidai, katana weren’t widespread in usage, and following that, there were regulations imposed upon who could own and wield one, as well as the simple fact that for most of the Edo period there were no large-scale wars of the kind seen during the Sengoku period.

However, that being said, during the Tokugawa shogunate (following the Sengoku period), a different type of weapon rose to the forefront – the [**wakizashi**](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wakizashi_2.JPG). Think longer than a dagger/dirk, but shorter than a true sword/katana. During the Edo, regulations imposed upon katana meant that, if it ever came to combat, it was too short to be effective against cavalry, and yet in melee the wakizashi was better. The wakizashi thus became the primary self-defense weapon, and the katana essentially made into a decoration, or used in rituals.

And then, the arrival of Matthew Perry and the following Meiji Restoration spelled the end for these swords. Rapid modernisation and Haitorei, or Sword Abolishment Edict, of 1876, essentially created a blanket ban on the wielding of swords in public. 
Returning to the question on the development of weapons though – swords, katana, whatever, were **never widespread in Japanese warfare**. Before the Sengoku period, bows were more common, or otherwise the naginata, a large polearm, both of which could be used on horseback. Other swords such as nodachi, large (read: very large) swords were also seen, though were still relegated to specialised units rather than an entire army.

**Naginata and various other weapons**

The naginata rose to the occasion during the Gempei war of the late 12th century, seen as a good way to knock other riders of horses. During the Sengoku period, these naginata soon became replaced with the yari due to the changing of battlefield tactics, then in the Edo, it was more commonly seen as a woman’s weapon, and finally it fell out, similar to the katana, during the Meiji Restoration. Similarly, larger swords such as the nodachi are pushed into the role of decorations or rituals, rather than actual combat.

**Sengoku Era weapons**

Now to address the elephant in the room, which I’ve tried to avoid talking too much about so far – the Sengoku era, the Warring States period (not to be confused with the identically named period in China) which lasted throughout most of the 15th and 16th centuries of Japan. This was a time of political upheaval, with daimyo (similar to lords) all around the country vying for supremacy. All sides felt the need to field larger and larger armies, and it came to the point where numbers were better than the quality of warrior (more on this again in relation to firearms).

Ashigaru were conscripted peasants, and received the bare minimum amount of training, handed a yari (spear) or yumi (bow), and packed off to fight. Ashigaru and their weapons and armour were cheap – you didn’t need to spend years to train them to be master sharpshooters, or to best others in duels, you just needed them because the more numbers, the better. Imagine if you were a significantly superior fighter – if you saw hundreds of spears poking out at you, you would never engage them (unless all was lost, however this still supports the point that ashigaru were superior in numbers).

**Firearms**

However, with the first contact with the West in the form of the Portuguese, the Japanese discovered the true power of gunpowder. Whilst firearms have been said to have reached Japan previously from China, they were never widely used. The matchlock, however, was. The smiths began to develop and adapt the gun, and soon enough daimyo were fielding matchlock ashigaru alongside their armies. So much so that, in 1567, Takeda Shingen, a prominent daimyo of the Sengoku, stated that

&gt; Hereafter, the guns will be the most important arms. Therefore decrease the number of spears per unit, and have your most capable men carry guns.

Yet again however, we see during the Edo that firearms, like swords, were reduced in numbers. Like swords, in small numbers they were produced, however unlike swords, their use increased again during the Meiji Restoration and reinstated contact with the West.

&gt;'*Suppose senior government officials in Greece had concluded that the euro was a failed experiment, that the rest of the continent would never extend reasonable terms to their country and would instead doom it to perpetual recession, and that the only way to save Greece from disaster -- and Europe, too -- was to begin the process of unwinding the common currency.*'

Seriously? I've seen Conspiracy Theory rags with less idiotic analyses. The hard part for me was to try and *suppose* that the author (Max Ehrenfreund) is neither a complete imbecile nor a shill. 

The subject matter of his article is ... *yet another speculative opinion piece*, itself with no content whatsoever  ... a grotesque Simon Nixon character assassination against Varoufakis (weasel words and all):

&gt;'*... the rest of the world is busily calling Tsipras and his advisers naïve and incompetent etc*'. 

Oh, so it's '*the rest of the world*', not you, who's trying to give an impression of naivete and incompetence ... riiight! :D

0,73,kieslowskifan,t5_2ssp3,"The P-38's service in the ETO has not necessarily been overlooked, it tended to serve in an earlier period of the air war and in areas like the Mediterranean that tend to receive less press. It also was not an enormously popular plane for pilots, especially those flying the escort missions over Europe from the UK. Hub Zemke, who flew P-38s, -51s, and 47s, has a very good dissection of the P-38's vices and virtues: 

&gt;-38--Though this aircraft had virtues, for me it was the poorest of the three US Army fighters in the European Theater. The fact that the extreme cold at altitude affected its performance hardly endears the machine. The turbosuperchargers were controlled by an oil regulator. At altitude the oil had a tendancy to congeal, which cause serious problems. On two occasions I recall, when entering combat with enemy single seaters it was a case of life and death to get away and survive, though I had started with the advantage.

&gt;On both occasions the engines either cut out completely or overran rpm limitations as the throttles were cut or advanced. It was enough just to regulate the engines and control the aircraft without entering combat.

&gt;The second serious limiting factor that detracted form the P-38's combat capability was its steep diving restriction--estimated at about 375 mph. A common tactic of the Luftwaffe single seaters was to split-S for the clouds or the deck. Oftentimes their head-on attacks on the bomber formations saw them roll over and dive for the deck to confuse and outdistance the flexible machine gunners. P-38s had little chance to pursue. When on defense, it can be easily understood that a dive to safety was the best maneuver for longevity.

&gt;Another factor to degrade the P-38's combat capability was the identification factor. The eyes of a pilot often picked up specks in the distance that could not be immediately identified as friend or foe. These were reported in as ""bogies."" Appropriate tactical maneuvers were taken to prevent bogies from having the advantage of a subsequent attack. In the case of the P-38 the twin booms and slab elevator gave this aircraft's identity away- as far as the eye could see.

&gt;It was also necessary for the P-38 pilot to do much more weaving to look down over the two engines that lay on each side of the cockpit. A better cockpit heating system could have been provided as my feet always froze at altitude.

&gt;Taken alone, the above statements would conclude that the P-38 had no outstanding features... it did! As a gun platform, it was steady as a shooting stand. With two engines there was no torque. With a little trim for buildup of speed (in a dive) a pilot could ride directly into a target.

&gt;As to the armament installation, I have seen no better. Four machine guns and one cannon in a tight pocket directly in front of the pilot. This armament being so closely aligned to the sight of plane of the gunsight required no convergence of fire as necessitated in fighters having their guns placed in the wings.

&gt;Though the P-38 had a wheel instead of the proverbial stick, this was no handicap- controls were light and response was excellent.

&gt;Relative load carrying capacity, the aircraft could take off with just about anything. I've taken off with a thousand-pound bomb under each wing and cruised with ease. On fuel consumption, the P-38 enabled us to cruise out to combat areas deep in Germany without the anguish of not having enough ""petrol"" to return home.

&gt;A tricycle landing gear made it much easier for a junior pilot to ""spike the kite"" on the runway and chalk up another landing. This was also an advantage in taxiing- a large engine and cowling did not deter from forward vision.

Note that a lot of the virtues Zemke lists of the P-38- range, load-carrying, heavy armament, good-low and medium altitude performance- were excellent virtues for a fighter operating in the Pacific theater. Even something as ergonomically mundane as a wheel instead of a stick helped aid the pilot in long Pacific sorties by lessening the pilot workload. Nor could the Japanese emulate some of the same tactics as the Luftwaffe. The lighter Japanese aircraft like the A6M did not dive terribly well. The October 1944 US technical report on the  A6M5 noted that ""the 'Zeke' is a most unpleasant aircraft in a dive due to heavy stick forces and excessive vibrations.""   

Overall, the P-38 has been given its due. The P-38 certainly receives more respectful treatment from historians than some other twin-engined fighters such as the Bf-110/410, Ki-45, J1N, or Fokker G.I.  It was an excellent performer in some areas, but unfortunately for its vices were most evident in the one theater in Europe that receives most attention- high-altitude 8th AF escort.

It would be easy to sell it if EZ politicians weren't so damn stubborn about it. All they would have to do is offer piecemeal debt relief in exchange for reforms. Obviously the debt relief would not be in the nominal amount of debt, it would be offered in ways that would obscure it.

There was already an agreement on future debt relief in the [2012 bailout programme which was supposed to be activated in 2013-2014](http://www.euractiv.com/sections/euro-finance/budget-surplus-earns-greece-debt-relief-eu-301708) but it never was so it's not as controversial as you make it out to be. 

&gt; Everyone knows the debt is not sustainable...but the interest payments is not making much difference as are the lowest possible.

The problem is that there are obvious financing gaps in the debt repayment schedule, particularly in about 5 years from now.

0,2,TomBombadildozer,t5_2qh0y,"Separate branches on distinct servers will give you good results with relatively low effort.

I would start by introducing the tooling (if you don't already have it) to record the metrics you care about. It doesn't have to be sophisticated--throw up Graphite, Prometheus, InfluxDB, or whatever to record raw metrics. Where you need more detail than time series data can provide, log the relevant information somewhere (this is actually a good application of MongoDB). Make sure that when you're recording this information, it's somehow qualified by which system/application/environment/whatever produced it.

Once you're recording the information you care about, make branches for your new UI components. Deploy them to distinct systems. Choose a strategy for diverting traffic to your experimental UI--it could be something as simple as sending users with even-numbered IDs to one side and odds to the other, diverting the most or least active users, or even a random selection. What's important here is developing a strategy that makes sense in the context of the changes you want to test.

With that done, store the (ideally, simple) data you're going to use for routing traffic in a cookie. Configure your front-end load balancers to route based on the cookie presented by clients. At this point, you've got traffic flowing to both mainline and experimental versions of the application and you can observe the effect on your metrics. If you want to test on a grander scale--for example, suppose you believe Europeans use your application much differently from how Americans do and you want to confirm experimentally--you could substitute GLB for cookie-based routing. 

In principle, you could run as many experimental instances of the application as you like to see how it impacts your outcomes. Just take care to only change one or two variables at a time (say, the layout of a single form, or the style of a common UI element) so you can be confident in the independence of your observations.",t1_cspxj40,t3_3bv6le,0,,,,2,False,,1440504281,Python,False,False,0,1435850813,t3_3bv6le,cspxj40

The original border between the two continents [came across the Phasis/Rioni river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rioni_River), which even further south than the current divide, below the Caucasus range. Though the Don river has been considered the border for most of recorded history, dissenting voices that put the boundary at the Causasus generally came from western Europe:

&gt; Philip Johan von Strahlenberg in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the Volga, following the Volga north until the Samara Bend, along Obshchy Syrt (the drainage divide between Volga and Ural) and then north along Ural Mountains.[8][9] The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The 1745 atlas published by the Russian Academy of Sciences has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as Serafimovich before cutting north towards Arkhangelsk, while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as John Cary followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the Kuma–Manych Depression was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,[9][10] and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.

&gt; By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the Volga–Don Canal and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the Greater Caucasus watershed to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a ""controversy"" in geographical literature of the 1860s, with Douglas Freshfield advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the ""best possible"", citing support from various ""modern geographers"".[11]

Note how official Russian and Soviet policy generally subscribed to using the northern, Don River border rather than the Caucasus line.

&gt; In Russia and the Soviet Union, the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.[12] In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from Baydaratskaya Bay, on the Kara Sea, along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the Ural River until the Mugodzhar Hills, and then the Emba River; and Kuma–Manych Depression,[13] thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.[14] However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest[15] and this became the standard convention in the latter 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.",t1_cspy40d,t3_3btmea,0,,,,2,False,,1437525402,MapPorn,False,1435852604,0,1435851734,t1_cspxoiw,cspy40d

You want to know what else was basic?  The idea that neurons cannot change.  Oh how fundamentally wrong *that* was.  You know how it was proven wrong?

As for your claims regarding oxytocin, I will now attempt to disprove those, but I don't think you are going to listen to me.  Let's look again at what you said, just for context, with emphasis added.

&gt;For example, studies show females release oxytocin after intercourse and child birth for the purpose of creating neurological pathways that bind them to the other person. It's a really cool design and it's **completely missing with two men**. With two women we are finding out it is **overly exictatory** due to the effects of **estrogen amplifying oxytocin** and cause **neuro pathways to become too downtrodden**, so to speak. None of it is fulfilling the biological purpose God designed for human beings and therefore systems go haywire as is expected.

First claim: The oxytocin bonding system is completely missing in men.

- Increased oxytocin release during sexual activity in both women **and men**

* http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9361803
- Describing oxytocin as a vital part of the male reproductive system, including locations of production

Not to mention, oxytocin is not only released during things like sexual activity and childbirth, as you claim.  Rather, [this](http://news.softpedia.com/news/Petting-Pets-Releases-039-Love-Hormone-039-101965.shtml) is only one example of how oxytocin can be released from very mundane activities.

Also, I want to make it clear I am not debating whether or not testosterone is an antagonist to oxytocin.  I will make that clearer in a minute, but first, I want to point out one other antagonist to oxytocin.  That's right.  Progesterone.  http://www.biolreprod.org/content/67/1/184.full

Oxytocin is also not all about sex.  That is taking one hormone and saying that it has this singular very direct function, which is frequently not true.  Hormones are a complex interaction, just like neurotransmitters.  http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1820828,00.html http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2009/aug/13/oxytocin-pair-bonding-social

Additionally, oxytocin is not always even linked to pair bonding!  http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/oxytocin-hormone/ shows that it can *also* lead to increased feelings of envy. 

&gt;Here's my running list of when and where oxytocin has been found or suggested to surge in study done in humans and/or other mammals: For people with a uterus, during labor (a synthetic version of Oxytocin, Pitocin, is often used to induce labor), birth (vaginal delivery) and/or breastfeeding when men snuggle babies when we pet or look at our dogs during massage (from anyone, but found to elevate more in the massage therapist than the massage-ee) when we sing together in groups when we compete, play games or gamble kissing (though this apparently raises men's levels more than women's hugging acupuncture talking intimately with your friends, apparently especially between female friends yoga, meditation or prayer some foods: like chili peppers, which contain a compound called capsaicin, which has been shown to prompt a surge of oxytocin

&gt;Neuropsychologist Dr. Rick Hanson suggests that, ""Probably, oxytocin can also be released just by imagining – the more vividly, the better – the activities just mentioned.""

So if oxytocin is really ""surging and downtrodding neural pathways"" as you suggest, we would not be able to form bonds at all and we would **all** be suffering from lesbian bed death.  Not only that, but mothers who give birth to or breast feed multiple children will not be able to bond with their children because there is too much oxytocin.  Obviously, this is not true.

&gt;Though the central oxytocin studies often used for some of these claims were with voles, not humans, if we're going to talk about them and talk about oxytocin, we also have to talk about vasopressin, another very similar neuropeptide. And if we're going to talk about orgasm or sex and hormones, we can't really pull one ingredient out from the whole soup: our bodies can't and don't, after all. That'd be like suggesting that a three-layer-cake and flour, just one ingredient of that cake, are the same thing. On a chemical level alone, there are a host of chemicals that can be or are involved with sex and sexual response: androgens, estrogens, prolactin, cortisol, neurochemical almost always inextricably linked to oxytocin — serotonin, phenylethylamine and others, for people of all genders: not just women, not just men, and not just in interactions between women and men.

&gt;Where does a lot of this stuff come from that suggests that oxytocin, in the context of love or sex, is SO different for men and for women? As far as I can tell, a lot of it comes from sex and gender essentialism, much of which flies in the face of science. Oxytocin has also been studied far more in females than males, most likely because the most important role it has seemed to have so far is with labor, delivery, lactation and maternal behaviour.

&gt;Testosterone is known to suppress oxytocin. People might be able to get away with some generalizations about men and women because of that...but only if testosterone was exclusive to men. 'Cept it's not. Not only do we all have it, it plays some part in all sexual response. Certainly, most XY people have more testosterone, or higher levels, than most XX people, most of the time. That can be as little as two times as much to twenty times as much. When people are sexually aroused, all of our testosterone levels are elevated, whatever our sex or gender. Additionally — estrogen may increase — not create, increase — the effects of oxytocin. But men have estrogen, too, even though most women have more. And as we've already talked about, sex and sexuality is not merely chemical.

&gt;Looking at that list up there of situations in which oxytocin can purportedly rear it's oxytociny head, let's apply the same kind of logic some do with statements about sex and oxytocin to some of these other situations. Let's also use the same broad brush and total certainty in making them.

&gt;If we did, we might say things like: Mothers who deliver by C-section or who do not breastfeed will not be able to bond to their children. Post-menopausal women have a decreasing ability to bond with other people. (Grannies are gonna love that one.) Massage therapists can't pair-bond because they touch too many people. Mothers who deliver or breastfeed more than one child will be less and less able to bond to subsequent children. Because birth apparently creates the biggest oxytocin surges we know of, women may bond with anyone involved in their birth. Good news for obstetricians! People who have and care for pets will be less able to bond with other pets or people. People who sing in choirs or bands may as well be having orgies for all the oxytocin they're hurling around. People with autism may not be able to bond to anyone, ever.

&gt;Everything I've read on oxytocin from scientists has this funny thing where they tend to use the word ""may"" with claims, or where they talk about how their study makes suggestions which should lead to further study. The scientists doing the studies that are then cited by so many others are not making the kinds of definitive statements about oxytocin those folks are, and some are increasingly critical of the ways studies are both being conducted and used around neurochemistry and human behavior, particularly when evolutionary psychology is involved. If those scientists aren't making conclusive statements about their own work, no one else can really justify doing so. Scientists tend to understand the difference between hypothesis, theory and fact: those referencing science, or looking to support their own theses with it, could stand to be reminded of that.

Now, let this be a lesson to you.  Don't argue psychology with a psychology major.

0,4,geerussell,t5_2qh1s,"&gt;The surge in Monetarist thought within macroeconomics in the 1970s, first within the US academy, then in policy making and central banking domains around the globe, quickly morphed into an insular Groupthink, which trapped policy makers in the thrall of the self regulating, free market myth. [...] Across Europe, unemployment became a policy tool aimed at maintaining price stability rather than a policy target, as it had been during the Keynesian era up until the mid 1970s. Unemployment rose sharply as national governments, infested with Monetarist thought, began their long-lived love affair with austerity.

&gt;The Delors Report (1989), which informed the Maastricht conference, disregarded the conclusions of the Werner and MacDougall Reports about the need for a strong federal fiscal function because they represented ‘old fashioned’ Keynesian thinking, which was no longer tolerable within the Monetarist Groupthink that had taken over European debate.

&gt;The new breed of financial elites, who stood to gain massively from the deregulation that they demanded, promoted the re-emergence of the free market ideology that had been discredited during the Great Depression.

&gt;The shift from a Keynesian collective vision of full employment and equity to this new individualistic mob rule was driven by ideological bullying and narrow sectional interests rather than insights arising from a superior appeal to evidential authority and a concern for societal prosperity.

&gt;The Monetarist (neo-liberal) disdain for government intervention meant that the EMU would suppress the capacity of fiscal policy and no amount of argument or evidence, which indicated that such a choice would lead to crisis, would distract Delors and his team from that aim.

&gt;Delors knew that he could appease the French political need to avoid handing over policy discretion to Brussels by shrouding that aim in the retention of national responsibility for economic policy making. He also knew that the harsh fiscal rules he proposed that restricted the latitude of the national governments would satisfy the Germans.

&gt;Monetarism had bridged the two camps.

&gt;[...]But there is, of course, one thing that the Europeans failed to grasp as they soaked up American monetarism like illiterate sponges thirsty for anything that they could parade as ‘sophistication’ – such has been the inferiority of Europeans that goes back to the debates that we discussed earlier (Technology Gaps etc).

&gt;They failed to grasp that the US President floated the US dollar and abandoned any notion of convertibility – that is, in August 1971 the US dollar became a true fiat currency and the US government inherited significant federal capacity to maintain economic growth and low unemployment.

&gt;The European embrace of Monetarism led to the Maastricht Treaty and frightening fiscal rules that have created the crisis throughout Europe and the Depression in Greece.",t1_cspyryt,t3_3bvujk,0,,,,4,False,,1437525867,Economics,False,False,0,1435852757,t3_3bvujk,cspyryt

Relative values about the importance of work etc. differ among countries, but to make the European project work, they must converge towards a common standard AND social democracy in general has to be scaled back everywhere.
 
Larger economies in Europe (yes even Germany) went through a lot of painful reforms to reduce or rebalance the social-democratic components of the state, in the past two decades. Greece lied about its liabilities (pensions etc.) when joining the Eurozone.

Before the financial crises, Greece was buffeted by the purchasing power of the Euro and went longer without making these reforms. However, the outstanding debts now are not only larger than the Greek economy and denominated in Euros as opposed to Drachmas, but the austerity demands of creditors reduce growth, making repayment even more impossible. 

Because of nationalism, the EU can't just do what the US does: use tax transfers etc to pay off debts of weaker economies (ex. NY subsidizes Mississippi). As a result, we get this farce, where both Greece and Germany play victim.

http://forum.teratoday.com/topic/567-tera-dps-meter-release-thread/
http://forum.teratoday.com/topic/611-elitist-meter-the-premier-tera-dps-meter/

I really liked the first one but it no longer works. However, when it first came out, a LOT of people did a LOT of testing. In the EU forums a lot of people started comparing their e-peens using dps meter results if you're interested.

http://board.tera.gameforge.com/board2-tera-en/board58-general/board76-discussions-about-tera/209834-dps-meter/

I myself have done extensive testing using the DPS meters and have my own vague idea of the ranking of the DPS classes. So at the very least, I can claim that i know that zerk &gt; slayer &gt; warrior &gt; sorc in terms of dps. And yes I say that even though sorc is my main, I have cutting edge sorcerer title on it and over 100 days game time on it. 

As for evidence, I have elitist meter screenshots of SCHM second and last boss. I lost all of my other dps meter reading results though. Only one I still have is this one because of the youtube video it's associated with http://i.imgur.com/28t9SGM.png

I'll upload the SCHM dps meter results if you're interested though. I'll preface this by saying we're not the best tera players ever, but we did SCHM in full discovery, and did the 10 minute achievement to kill darkan on our first attempt after we got our generation weapons +14.

TLDR: Yes there isn't as much evidence as I would like but it isn't as lacking as you make it out to be. There's enough to give you a ROUGH idea of the rankings atleast. Yes, people who have no idea what they're talking about do spout out nonsense but don't use that to dismiss the opinions of people that do know what they're talking about.",t1_cspyzh5,t3_3br70h,0,,,,1,False,,1437525981,TeraOnline,False,False,0,1435853080,t3_3br70h,cspyzh5

I spent about 10 hours on this project to do a little something different. My wife and I made up a design in Illustrator and then I spent a few days putting it together. It was fun/different project but it definitely isn't perfect. I think I learned a lot from it and probably won't be making one of these again for awhile.

####Leathers

* Back Panel/Flap: Orange Baby Calf
* Front Panel: Light Tan Baby Calf
* Front Pocket: Royal Blue Baby Calf
* Gussets: Light Tan Baby Calf
* Lining: Tan Kidskin (Reversed)
* Edges: Painted Brown


####Learnings

* Gussets need to be more substantial.
* Need a better system for lining so it doesn't get the terrible wrinkly look.
* Figure out *everything* (where holes are going, etc) beforehand and don't improvise along the way.

I have had some [Nile Crocodile and American Alligator](http://imgur.com/a/7LE1f) for awhile and just haven't had a chance to make anything out of it yet. I got caught up to a good point on orders a few days ago and decided to just make *something* out of it.

It is genuine Nile Crocodile lined with European Royal Blue Baby Calf. All the edges are painted black and heat treated/sealed with beeswax. 

Thread is a waxed linen thread.

Very happy with how the edges turned out.

Sure you could zoom around in an Inty getting those sweet nullsec skill training bonuses, but you wouldn't be doing anything else. You would get the same bonuses for flying in a fleet, or solo, or whatever.

Edit: Additional thoughts below

On a gameplay basis, the biggest problem I see is it will disproportionally reward people who spend all day flying around in an instawarping interceptor and don't interact otherwise. I'm not so sure literally impossible to catch ships (unless you live in Europe) should even exist, but that's a different discussion. But when they're doing that, they are at least actively playing (space tag, I guess). I specified uncloaked because obviously cloaking forever in low or npc null is trivial (after the new sov decloak structures are implemented). Anyone who stayed permanently logged in and decloaked can be found^1, and I think the idea of combat probing for AFK skill trainers in null is hilarious.

I have been looking through for the past year, reading various articles, watching various footage.

None proofed anything. 

As my point I state [this](http://i.imgur.com/1vft3xL.jpg) picture. If you don't speak Russian - I'll translate it for you.

In the first one, it says, in Ukrainian, that ""Russians attacked the peaceful citizens of Donbass"". Some trivia - Donbass is the place where Ukrainians are sending military to kill citizens that protect the city. Fun fact - they attack their own men, kill them, slay them. 

Second one shows the Russian news footage - ""Ukrainian avengers attack their own citizens"". Might not be true as well, as to ""why the fuck kill your own people""? But hey, let's look at the third one.

No comment. Guess why.

As I was browsing the web I watched a lot of footage from the perspective of the Donbass citizens. As you might not know, most of the population in Donbass is Russian-speaking.

While watching it, I saw a lot of dead Ukrainians. Locals, from Donbass, killed by the Ukrainian military.

In fact, currently the so-called war is just a civil war. Ukrainians kill Ukrainians, people from Europe help the Ukrainian military side to fight, assault the city, the airports. Ex-USSR side (excluding current EU members) mostly support the civil Ukrainian side, the citizens of Donbass that are currently defending their ground.


My favourite fact - Wikipedia info on who's in charge of the Donbass ""civil army"".

If you look at it, you'll see that 85% of them are pure ukrainians. I actually found a single Russian there that spent most of his life as a mercenary. War is a work for him, and it's obvious that he's just earning his cash.

I've never seen good evidence that Russian army is in there. As I said before, citizens of most ex-ussr countries come as freelancers, and not more. If there'd be Russian army - it wouldn't last long. Think about the potential of a country with the world's one of the most massive nuclear potentials, forced army for every 18-~30 male that has no kids and isn't studying. 

Some men mean nothing. They can, and most probably are freelancers.

The moment more than 50% of the army of Donbass isn't from Ukraine - call me. Else it's just a civil war, and nothing more.

The malaysian airplane is a good example. Happened almost a year ago, yet everyone was calling it on Russians. After a year of investigation they can't proof a thing. All their consensus came to a fact that it wasn't Russians, and they stopped after it to not show Ukraine in a bad light, sadly.

Well for one, it would fit better in your own 'Fairness Doctrine'. You want to be inclusive, but you don't need to include anyone from Cobalt, because Miller is also EU? For real? As if we're not competing with Miller? We might even be adversaries. How is it fair that one of the servers has 3 admins, and the other has none? 

On top of that, we clearly think more along the lines of Emerald, than we do with Miller. I don't see how 'both being from EU' is a reason to not include Cobalt in your pool of admins.

What if a problem comes up, and you form a committee of admins to make a ruling? There won't be anyone from Cobalt, but there will probably be several from Miller. And the problem they have to rule on, will always affect their server, even if it's just indirectly. 'Fairness', nice word. 'Inclusive' is lovely too. How about applying it to your own organisation? Ever heard of 'leading by example'?

And how would changing the rules and Cobalts selection process make things better? We now have a perfect mix of elitists and casuals. There is not a single outfit on Cobalt complaining about our selection, because it's fair. So how would it make things better to take away the FC or committee's right to chose, and give it to the reps? Why can't you tell the people from Cobalt who put in their time and effort to make ServerSmash a great event, that they're doing a fine job and that you're happy with their contribution? 

Because unlike what PSB might think, while they do organise the games, it's not because of them that SS is popular on Cobalt. It's thanks to people like Halo &amp; Blckjck.

 [**Munich Agreement**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich%20Agreement): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __Munich Agreement__ was a settlement permitting [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany)'s [annexation of portions of Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Czechoslovakia) along the country's borders mainly inhabited by German speakers, for which a new territorial designation ""[Sudetenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudetenland)"" was coined. The agreement was negotiated at a conference held in [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich), Germany, among the major powers of Europe, excluding the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) and Czechoslovakia. Today, it is widely regarded as a failed act of [appeasement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement) toward Germany. The agreement was signed in the early hours of 30 September 1938 (but dated 29 September). The purpose of the conference was to discuss the future of the Sudetenland in the face of ethnic demands made by [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler). The agreement was signed by Germany, [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic), the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), and [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861-1946\)). Sudetenland was of immense strategic importance to [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia), as most of its border defenses were situated there, and many of its banks [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] and heavy industries were located there as well.

Paris, Rome, Venice, Florence : Food, history&amp;culture &amp; lots of romance - also all cities are beautiful and perfect to just walk around

In addition, Barcelona is just great. You can go to the beach, have culture, great tapas food and really relaxed people. Also the architecture is stunning and the atmosphere is great. Here you could add in a fancy cocktail bar / beach club (e.g. carpe diem on the beach) to have a bit of going out :)

2 weeks are already more than full with that but just in case you would also like to go to Eastern Europe, I would recommend Prague and Budapest: here 2 hotel recommendations http://karateandcaviar.com/budapest-where-to-stay-and-what-to-do/

0,21,spin0,t5_2qh4j,"&gt; In retrospect, Europe’s first mistake was letting Greece into the euro zone in 2001. 

Yes. It indeed was. 

I remember how Germany opposed. Also the Netherlands. And Finland (*. And how France was pushing for it (France: ""Surely we not only let but also need the cradle of democracy in the Euro."")

Yet, however obvious it may seem to some now, at the time it really was inconceivable that a country would willingly shoot itself in the foot and lie it's way into Euro for its own detriment. Still hard to compute that. Never mind the part where Greece, once accepted into the Eurozone, started it's membership by insisting that also Cyprus should be allowed as a member ASAP or Greece would start using its new veto on any other future memberships. So, enter Cyprus. Too soon. And they did kinda okay until banks getting ruined by the Greek debt. I don't know what the great idea was in doing that.

&gt; Germans wagered correctly that Greek accession would enlarge the market for their exports. 

We're talking about a market about the size of a peanut when compared to the big picture (Sorry Greece. Okay, size of a calamata). But as Greece was already a member of the EU, let's not get ahead of ourselves with ridiculous claims of a new export market which actually was already available to all EU members even without the Greek EZ membership.

&gt; But they were wrong in thinking that Greece would be inspired or forced to fix its rickety economy.  Corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency went unabated. 

Yeah, we all were wrong about that despite the opposite promises. (The 2001-2009 in a nutshell: the Eurogroup/Commission every year: ""Greece, here's a list of your vulnerabilities, please do fix your economy."" Greece: ""Yes, first thing in the morning!"")

The big problem was that the Eurogroup had 1) no mechanism nor authority to audit Greece's books and 2) no mechanism nor authority to make Greece to actually reform its economy.

And that is also why the Eurogroup wanted the IMF as a partner in the bailouts. Because the IMF has the muscle that the Eurogroup does not. And on the flipside, that is the reason the new Greek government is doing everything they can to get the IMF out and to deal with their Eurogroup partners only.

&gt; The second mistake was allowing Greeks to overborrow; optimistic investors accepted yields on sovereign debt nearly as low as those Germany paid. 

That was not a mistake of others as there was absolutely no way to prevent Greece from doing it. All there was was giving advice not to do it. It was the Greeks borrowing and no-one else but Greeks could have stopped it. Except the markets. And eventually they did just that. And as they did that and Greece was shut out of markets with the -16% deficit Greece asked for a bailout from their Euro partners instead of defaulting.

&gt; The third mistake was to treat the problem by piling on official loans rather than by restructuring the private-sector debt.

Actually most of the private debt got restructured with about €100 bn haircut on capital, and swaps with longer maturity and lower yield bonds. The rest was swapped to long maturity low interest loans from the partner institutions. Only a very small amount of private debt remained at face value after that (pretty much only the small amounts that vulture funds such as *Dart* had managed to buy). (** 


*) In polandball universe:  
Finland: ""I don't think it's entirely credible that Greece has actually fixed their economy in mere two years.""  
Greece: ""You call me a liar? Huh? Prove it!""   
Finland: ""Well I'm not allowed to access your economic data.""   
Greece:""So there. You don't even know what you're talking about.""   
Finland: ""Well, that's exactly the probl..""  
France: ""And as that discussion has been concluded let's move on to the next item on the list.

In any case, whiteness in America is slowly bestowed on those who can pass. [Here's Benjamin Franklin's view on whiteness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observations_Concerning_the_Increase_of_Mankind,_Peopling_of_Countries,_etc.):

&gt; All Africa is black or tawny. Asia chiefly tawny. America (exclusive of the new Comers) wholly so. And in Europe, the Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians and Swedes, are generally of what we call a swarthy Complexion; as are the Germans also, the Saxons only excepted, who with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth.

So starting from English and Saxons being the only ""real"" white people, later that was extended to many of those European peoples he first names as ""swarthy"" (plus the Irish, in time). It's generally based on very few physical characteristics, chiefly skin color.

0,5,OgerBox,t5_2u29i,"The first half of the Major League Soccer season has brought plenty of excitement.

There hasn't been a game this season anyone has been able to predict with any reliability, making nearly every game a must-watch. And some of the league's marquee players are living up to the hype.

Orlando City's Kaká has scored in six of his past eight games and is beginning to look more like the player everyone thought he could be in this league. Not coincidentally, the Lions are 6-1-2 during that span.

New York City FC's David Villa has four goals and an assist in his last five league games, with NYCFC rebounding from an awful start to go 3-1-1 in that span.


Toronto FC's Sebastian Giovinco is the league's halfway MVP. The Italian is third in the league in both goals (8) and assists (7) and appears to be the catalyst that will finally get Toronto to the playoffs.

None of those players lead the league in any category — Columbus' Kei Kamara leads in goals (12), while his teammates Ethan Finlay leads in assists (10). And the likes of Octavio Rivero, Clint Dempsey, Chris Wondolowski and Fabian Castillo are all providing plenty of fireworks.

Sporting KC's Benny Feilhaber is a close second in the MVP race, with nine assists to go along with five goals for a Sporting team that sits third in the league in points per game.


But here's where things get crazy. The second half of the season could be a completely different look for MLS.


Three of the world's biggest stars are jumping into the fray this month. Former Chelsea and Juventus greats Frank Lampard and Andrea Pirlo are joining NYCFC, while Liverpool icon Steven Gerrard will play for L.A. Galaxy. All three are game-changing, league-altering players who have competed on the world's biggest stages and won some of the most important trophies in soccer.

All three sell jerseys. All three fill stadiums. All three should immediately prove to be among the best players in MLS.

MLS is a growing league, so much so that even in the midst of a season the league can up its star status significantly and reinforce its aspirations to become one of the top leagues in the world. If the first half of the season was about how far the league has come in 20 years, the second half is about where it wants to go in the next decade.

It's going to take time — signing players like Lampard (37) and Pirlo (36), have short-term, not necessarily long-term impact — but this is more about the league's owners showing a commitment to spend on a grander scale.

Of course, that commitment can't have tunnel-vision, focusing solely on aging European stars.

The spending must include the infrastructure of MLS academies and USL affiliates, which will provide the future American stars. And it especially must include paying the bright, young American stars like Bill Hamid, Wil Trapp, Jose Villareal, Gyasi Zardes, Dillon Powers and Luis Gil.

Yes, an exciting second half to 2015 is just starting, but if MLS makes the right steps, it could be an even bigger second half to the decade.

MLS power rankings

While D.C. United has put some good distance between itself and every other team in the East, the West remains a wide-open race and everyone else in the East probably still feels it has a shot at the playoffs.
That doesn't even include a potential change to MLS player acquisition rules that could lead to the signing of Mexican stars Giovani Dos Santos, who has been linked to the Galaxy, and Javier ""Chicharito"" Hernandez, who could wind up right here in Orlando.",t1_csq8skk,t3_3bw321,0,,,,5,False,,1440503646,OCLions,False,False,0,1435868061,t3_3bw321,csq8skk
