0,6,atenirp,t5_2qhmg,"I just enrolled in a 2-year Master's of Marketing program at a school in Europe, starting in September. I was debating for over a year if it was a good idea or not since most of the people in this sub from previous similar threads seem to think that it's unnecessary. I've lurked on this topic on /r/marketing for a while here's what i've gathered. 

Everyone will tell you experience is the most important thing in the field of marketing. Some people go as far as saying that if you have a master's you'll appear overqualified and it will actually hurt your chances of getting a job. Some people say that you don't even need a degree at all to get good marketing jobs. 

Many people say that pursuing a masters is only a good if you do it at a top school for networking purposes. I see where they're coming from, but I find it hard to believe that the benefits gained from networking would really pay off in the long run considering the tuition costs. Others say it's only good if you want to work at a big corporation as a manager of some sort, and if you're wanting to work at a small agency it's useless. I don't really want to work at a corporation but I could see myself doing it if the brand stood for something I believe in, so i guess it's good to have the degree.

Most people will tell you that it's best to get 2-3 years of work experience before going to MBA or Msc Marketing. I think they're absolutely right. I got my bachelors in psychology in 2010, I've been working in marketing for a couple years now. I would definitely not want to go into the master's program without the working experience that I have now. I plan to continue working at least part-time online for this company while I'm doing the masters so I can try to apply anything I'm learning in school to the business i'm working for. 

With all that said, my school is tuition free so it made it a lot easier for me to decide on going for the master's since it wont cost me a ton of money in the end and it's a good life experience. If I had to take out a fuck-ton of student loans I'd probably skip it altogether and wouldn't go back to school unless the employer paid for it. 

If you're not going to grad school you can still also just get various marketing qualifications online that will add a bit to your resume.

I'm 28 years old now and the way I look at it, If I don't go back to school by the time I'm 30, I never will. I'd hate to look back when I'm 40 and wish I would've just gotten the degree while I had the opportunity. 
 
I hope that helps.

First, thank you to both you and Hermann and others for the praise. Not sure it's deserved - like at least 80% of the time I'm just a rote shitposter. That Hermann fellow, however, knows an inordinate amount more rayciss history than I; pressuring him into writing an ebook is my pet project on this sub. Admittedly, we're not gaining a lot of traction...

Anyhow,

&gt;I've just skimmed over the article and the responses down bellow, there was quite a bit of criticism that seemed perfectly valid to me, taking that into account and following the general rule that one ""groundbreaking"" work doesn't necessarily imply that the postulations there exposed must be right, no matter how well argumented, I think that saying it blows the HBD-sphere is going a bit overboard. Granted, I don't even know what this sphere is about, but whatever.

I immediately wish I had written *blown up in* in lieu of *blown up*, because I did not mean to imply that the whole of HBD has been invalidated by Chisala's study. You're quite right that there are valid arguments to call into question his findings, not the least of which is the state-created selective pressure put on Igbo immigrants trying to escape to Europe and America. [Anatoly Karlin, another Unz.com columnist, wrote his own response to the kerfuffle](http://www.unz.com/akarlin/africa-and-cognitive-colonialism/); admittedly, its less than intuitive, but presents a fascinating attempt to try and calm the waters while explaining the ramifications of Chisala's study. I'm not sure Karlin is correct either; his assertion that environmental depression of IQs in Africa accounts for a full standard deviation or more between the macro-races is particularly questionable, to my mind. Still, informative.

Whether or not Chisala is ultimately correct about the death of the white-black IQ gap, however, the Igbo people have historically been high achievers, and, yes, they are definitely Africans (more on that in a moment). My point is not to throw my hands in the air and proclaim ""Academic racial realism is kaput!"" so much as it is to demonstrate that blanket-labeling all black-skins as low IQ wastrels is - while understandable given the odds - not intellectually honest, which goes to the OP's point that raycissm is about more than race, paradoxically. 

Finally, human biodiversity is (paraphrasing), according to hbd chick (basically our capitalization-challenged female messiah), a multi-disciplined approach to studying the differences and similarities in genetic and phenotypic output inherent in every person, family, clan, tribe, population, and, importantly, race. [I'd encourage you to read her introduction here](https://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2014/08/21/what-is-human-biodiversity-hbd/), as she is wantonly more eloquent than I, and probably has a much better handle on the geneticist-specific aspects of the field (I'm just a guy who likes numbers and silly racist internet memes, after all). It truly is a fascinating little niche of non-PC science, sadly maligned as rayciss more often than not. If you want to dive into the studies that comprise the whole of the rayciss kernel of HBD, the sidebar has a pretty swell link (""Human Biological Diversity Resources"").

0,9,PotvinSux,t5_2r2ad,"Even as a gay person, some of the parade stuff upsets me as well. Mostly, I've found that this is cultural - parades in general are not traditional to Eastern European culture outside of religious processions in Tsarist times and then the military parades of the USSR. On the contrary, parading in Western and Southern Europe is historically linked with the flamboyance of *carnival*, which was all about celebrating deviation (per Bakhtin, it originated and served as the safety valve for all the pressures of an otherwise regimented and conservative medieval society). This has been embraced by broader Western culture because, hey, parades are fun. Consequently, parades of all sorts are common. [Here is a list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Parades_in_New_York_City) of all the parades commonly held annually in New York. So, I think you're kind of misunderstanding the idea that gays consider themselves particularly special to have a parade - many minorities do in the West, and half of these parades have people in skimpy clothing. Gay pride parades in the West are about as sexual as the typical carnival parade. The difference is instead of half-naked women, you have half-naked men. It's weird to me, but I don't think it actually hurts anyone so I've just accepted that it's my problem not theirs. There is none of this background in the East, and, as a consequence, when activists try to import the ""gay pride parade"" idea into Orthodox Europe as a protest for gay rights, it doesn't quite fit and just ends up upsetting people. On your other point, I would hope you support gay adoption. The sociological literature is essentially unanimous that, all other things being equal, children fare as well with gay parents as with straight parents. 

Finally, the rainbow thing... I mean c'mon. What a silly thing to resent. The main reason not to wear ""rainbowy clothes"" is that the colors will clash and it'll look bad. You can still love rainbows. That doesn't make you gay, and anyone who says it does is an idiot. Bigots are your problem, not gay people.

While I consider myself a socialist, I am not so misguided to think that the USA is anywhere near a potential socialist revolution. I really think it never will be because of the extreme apathy of most of the citizens and more physical restrictions. 

Lets be real here. Bernie Sanders is no socialist. He does not advocate for workers control over the means of production. He also never seems to mention the lower class and is constantly refering to the classes as if he thinks we should have them. That the rich should actually exist, but just be more regulated. He is essentially a typical european social democrat. In europe he would be regarded as a normal politician with fluffy hair. The US is so far behind the rest of the world at this point, that we really do need him just to get caught up. 

Cons. I have a few besides the fact that he is not actually a socialist. He does not seem to have a very anti Israel stance which is something I would appreciate. However no one does, so we don't have a better alternative that still advocates for what Bernie advocates for (correct me if i'm wrong). He also said in an interview that he would continue very limited drone strikes which is something I am VERY against. 

Bottom line: He really isn't a dream candidate. I am much more radical than him. However we are talking about US politics. In that context, he is an extremely rare case. He is honest with what he says and actively challenges the 1%. We need that. Most of what he proposes makes all the sense in the world to me. Just not far enough. I don't think he's the lesser of evils, just the absolute best we have, and probably the best we will have for a long time.

There's nothing inherently wrong with that, until they start trying to pass legislation by the justification of biblical foundations. On the Left Wing though, the Democrats play to very liberal ideas, such as socialism, government regulation, stronger unions, all of which are not necessarily bad things, until a liberal tries to implement them and screws it up. Yes, that was sarcasm reddit, put down the pitchfork.

I don't think that the Democrats are nearly as good at garnering popular opinion in America as most liberals think, after all the Republicans now have a majority in both the House and the Senate (and IMO the Republicans have a good shot at winning the presidency too). Also keep in mind that Europe =/= abroad, there are plenty of places like China, Russia, Indonesia, where the liberal views of our Left Wing are not so popular. But I agree that popularity is not necessarily a good thing.

I was raised in a very atheist family, where traditional values weren't actually held in very high esteem, and I went to a private school in Baltimore which was ludicrously liberal, then a high school in Pennsylvania which was also very very liberal (but also a bit more level-headed).

Oh and I couldn't agree more about the extremism of some ""Republicans"" (RINOs if you ask me), it's a little absurd sometimes.

0,3,mcapello,t5_2sfmf,"&gt;But why does the State recognize this and offer tax benefits and special privileges to people who decide to go this route? This punishes people based on a lifestyle choice to remain ""single."" Really, we are all single people who should be entitled to the same rights and responsibilities as anyone.

First of all, this tendency is not universal. There is such a thing as a ""marriage penalty"" for cases where filing as a joint household actually obligates you to pay more in taxes. 

Second of all, it seems rather silly to say that the state should not recognize marriages at all simply because *some* of the benefits which accrue to married couples are unfair or inconsistent. It seems like it would be much more logical to simply eliminate those benefits if they were perceived as unfair. Secondly, the government already subsidizes a whole variety of life choices, from having children to buying a home. It doesn't seem entirely inconsistent for it to subsidize marriage if it deems that doing so could benefit society (whether it does or not is another question -- the point is that providing tax benefits for desirable behaviors is nothing new, nor exclusive to marriage).

&gt;I am not a religious person, but I can see how faiths that celebrate marriage would be upset about not only gay marriage, but any marriage granted to parties that are not a part of the religion. In a childish sense, this was ""their thing,"" and it has been hijacked by others outside the religion who disrespect the sanctity of the marriage through adultery, divorce, and now homosexual relationships. It undermines the sacred meaning of the religious ritual.

Actually, you have it backwards. Marriage was originally a civil institution and (in the West) only became the ""business"" of religion about 1,000 years after Christianity got going, and it only became exclusively religious as late as 1566.

&gt;And it is just that: a religious ritual. It is a conflict of Church and State for our government to hand out licenses so that people may practice parts of their religion. It is also a conflict of Church and State for our government to force that religious group to include groups in their rituals that are outside of their religion. The third is that our government offers special privileges to people who decide to be a part of that group and perform that ritual.

No, it really isn't. Marriage existed for thousands of years before the Church. Hell, it existed for over a thousand years independent of the Church even when it started butting its nose in peoples' business. In the European tradition, marriage was fundamentally a publicly celebrated contract between two families.

The roman armies were very impressive in their own right. The mongols armies were impressive in their own right. And the US military obviously is impressive in its own right.

It's better to ask which army's achievements were most impressive or which army is the most impressive. 

As for achievements, personally, I think the mongol achievements were the most impressive. They took out two of the preeminent centers of the world ( china, persia/middle east ), conquered central asia, siberia, russia and drove all the way to western europe. They battled from vietnam to egypt to japan to austria and everything in between. And they won far more than they lost. If the mongols were white, we'd be in complete awe of their accomplishment rather than caricaturing them. The mongol legacy touches everything from the italian renaissance to the moscow to beijing to the taj mahal. But ultimately history will judge them fairly as time passes. 


As for the most impressive, there isn't an army/military that is as impressive as the US military. Neither the mongols, the romans, the ancient greeks, etc could touch the level of achievements/domination/etc that the US military has. In 1945, the US could have pretty much conquered the entire world as the US military had total control over the skies, seas and nukes and an economy to pack the military production. Even today, in a non-nuclear war of conquest, the US military is the only military capable of matching and/or exceeding the mongol achievements. It's hard for the US military to gain achievements since nobody really challenges the US and we do not have the imperial national character. The democratic nature of our political system hamstrings what we can really do and nobody really challenges the US.

Head of the German Economics Institute giving a Press conference after fact checking, with thousands of man hours, the statement bay Varoufakis ""90% of the bailout is used to pay back foreign banks"".

I will translate the relevant portions:

Since 2008-

Greece has accumulated 108 bn deficit spending, financed by bail out money.

Greece has paid back foreign creditors with 113 bn, now owes this to EZ countries under better conditions.

Greece used 104 bn to support Greek banks due to capital flight of the Greeks (voting with their wallets).

So 1/3 was ""used to pay back foreign creditors.

&gt; Spending other people's money is a ridiculous statement. Every economy is based on loans and debt. 

Yes, but only if your economy is based on the open market. Greece cannot get loans on the open market since 2008. Do not forget this, this is not a business deal, we are helping you with these loans, at below cost, because nobody will give you any more money. So by not reducing your deficit you are spending other peoples money.

You or the Greek public do not not want to understand this, but we will not gift you 100s of billions year after year, so you will run out of money and learn the hard way.

After the Ottomans conquered Constantinople, there was a pressure on the Central European nations to form an empire or alliance of kingdoms, which could stop the Ottomans. The main European power of the 14/15th century, which tried to stop the Turks was Hungary. The Hungarian budget under King Matthias I was 1,000,000 golden forints, while the [Black Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Army_of_Hungary) and the upkeeping of the many border fortresses costed 800,000 golden forints in a year. That shows why a single European power of that time couldn't stop the Ottomans and that was the reason why King Matthias of Hungary conquered Austria and Silesia, while he mantained a peace with the Ottomans for many years; he tried to forge an empire strong enough to stop the Turks. After his death the Hungarian nobles elected a king from the Jagellonian dynasty, and again a new empire formed from Poland, Czechia and Hungary. After the [battle of Mohacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Moh%C3%A1cs), because of the agreements of the Habsburgs and Jagellonians, and because of the death of King Louis II, the Habsburgs, who only had Austria up until that point (emperor of the HRE was an empty title), inherited a big part of Central Europe and they created the empire which the previous dynasties tried to create.

Central Europe with the wealth of Burgundy and Spain with the Americas made the Habsburgs a leading European power, and as such they took part in every war in Europe.

---

&gt;""__Daydream__"" is a song recorded in 1969 by the [Belgian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium) band [Wallace Collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Collection_(band\)). It was composed by band members Sylvain Vanholme and Raymond Vincent, with David MacKay  who also produced the single.  The song is in the [symphonic pop/rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphonic_rock) genre, and uses strings and flutes. The song was a hit in mainland Europe, though popularity didn't make it to English speaking countries, despite its use of English lyrics. The song was covered several times, most notably by the Gunter Kallmann Orchestra in 1970.

Most developed countries have universal healthcare.

The US has the highest per-capita healthcare expenditure in the world, and still provides worse coverage than most EU nations - even after Obamacare's improvements to their system.

&gt;guess who keeps the EU safe? US

Ukraine spends 2.9% of the GDP on military and still got fucked by Russia (realistically the only threat to Europe, if there is any at all), with no help from the USA. Granted, they aren't members of the EU or NATO.

The UK, France, Portugal, Greece and Serbia all spend 2% or more on military. Poland spends 1.8%. Germany spends 1.3, although they are the largest economy in Europe anyway. Admittedly, this leaves a lot of small countries, along with Italy and Spain, with low military spending in comparison.

In addition, part of US funds also go towards defending South Korea (2.6%) and Japan (1%, although thanks to the US they are constitutionally forbidden from having a military capable of attacking anyone).",t1_csod6ga,t3_3bouva,0,,,,11,False,,1437482499,worldnews,False,1435725143,0,1435724937,t1_csocd43,csod6ga

*Ouvrir les prisons, légaliser les crimes de tous, c’est tuer dans l’oeuf le business de ceux qui ont fait profession des trafics illégaux, en profitant, de plus en plus et de manière de plus en plus dangereuse, d’une économie de la prohibition.

Sure, Iraq was technically a nation for decades, but like much of the middle east and Africa, it was  a nation carved arbitrarily by an imperial power without proper regard for legitimate national distinction.

In the case of Europe, Nation-state implies one people under one state, and this hardly applies to the EU.  The leftist Greek government doesn't rail against Greeks, but instead against perceived EU opponents and especially against Germany.

&gt; The US Agriculture Secretary, Tom Vilsack, was in Brussels this week, among other things to have lunch with EU Agriculture Ministers during their monthly Council meeting. He also took the opportunity to have a discussion with Commissioner Ciolos on some of the agricultural issues that are proving difficult to resolve in the ongoing negotiations on the US-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) free trade agreement.
&gt;
&gt; One of these issues is the EU demand that the US should recognise and protect the EU’s list of geographical indications (GIs). Geographical Indications are defined in the WTO as “indications which identify a good as originating in the territory of a Member, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin”.


I'm sure that there's going to be some stuff that the US wants that the EU will hold their nose swallowing and some stuff that the EU wants that the US will hold their nose swallowing.

From a US standpoint, the EU is asking for ownership of valuable brands that have become widely-used generic terms *after* they were probably only widespread in the US *because* of the generic status.  The US itself rarely has geographically-bound brands.

On the other hand, from the EU standpoint, the US was always making confusingly-labeled knockoffs.

I suspect that this is just going to be a ""suck it up and live with it and let Europe have it"" sort of affair in the US.  If it's true that the equivalent US goods are comparable in quality and marketing, then US producers of various goods will ultimately be able to establish their own brands (or, preferably, their own cross-industry generic terms) as replacements for the PDO term.  There will be a big chunk of money lost in the meantime, but whadda gonna do?

In terms of your extra-curricular achievements, they won't matter in an ESL job. I don't see them helping you get a job over someone else. Same with your degree; for the majority of ESL jobs, a BA is a BA, unless it's specifically English or Linguistics related. Your degree is fine - you will be able to find a job - I'm just giving you a heads up that your list doesn't give you any advantage over other applicants in the way that the extra-curricular stuff would help you get jobs back home. 

In China and Korea you will make plenty of money. I've no idea how high your student loans are, but in both of these countries you will be able to save $1k a month with even the barest effort. Korea will pay you about $2300 a month and will pay your accom. Tax is low, healthcare is subsidized, and you will take home around $2k of that. You could live in Korea for $500 a month if you put effort in. However, doing private lessons is technically illegal for most visa holders in Korea, so privates are reasonably tricky to come across (although lucrative - expect $40ish per hour). 

China has plenty of scope for privates. You can do a full time job during the day (full time is usually 35-40 hours a week in-school, but expect 20-25 teaching hours). You could easily pack some privates on top of that and pull in $30 an hour for those. I know many guys here are earning $4-5k per month, but those guys are putting in a serious fucking shift. $2-3k should be easy enough, and you can expect free accom with full time jobs as well. Saving potential there is very high - someone else can probably give you some numbers on how much they saved. 

If you don't need a TEFL, don't bother getting an online one. They're shite. There is value in you getting a CELTA - it will open up more, better paid jobs for you and will teach you how to teach to a decent level. You will learn most of your teaching skills on the job. If you need a TEFL to get a visa, just do the cheapest online one you can find, but commit to doing a legit course (CELTA etc) when you can to improve your teaching skills. Your students deserve it and there are too many bad teachers doing this job. 

If you get a full time, you will be doing classic 9-5 (at a gov school) or probably something like 2pm-10pm (for a private academy). There are also split shifts which generally suck ass (0900-1200, 1400-1600, 1900-2200). Fuck that. Will you get bored? No idea man. Only you can answer that. I find the kids pretty funny most of the time though, for what it's worth.

My other expat friends: a few stockbrokers here in HCMC, soldiers in Korea, and bartenders in Australia :)

France - I have no idea about, other than 'wages are low, taxes are high'.

Its a flag isnt it? Just a flag. There is nothing in the constitution about it, right? A flag flown all the time will get tatty and needs to be thrown out and replaced, its bound to touch the ground at some point. And if its being replaced then it cant be all that important can it?

Is this another one of those ""the USA has no historical existance"" things? By that I mean that I have heard people say the reason the USA is so against messing with its constitution is because it more or less IS the country and unlike Europe, where countries have thousands of years of historical precedent for existing, the USA pretty much only has the constitution so people feel that changing it voids the USA's place.

I guess not. Your argument is your sovereignty. And it's a good argument. I would feel the same. In the movie Gandhi, there is this dialogue where the British viceroy warns him that independence will cause many problems. Gandhi says: ""yes, but they will be our problems"".

So although your argument is valid did you at least consider the possibility that I am right? NO being followed by forced to leave the EU? For me, that would the choice a lot more difficult.

You can get by with English but Spanish and Arabic is a big plus.

How often do they see tourists?
We were in town for about 4-5 days and did not see any tourists. All the foreigners there worked for the UN.

How is the food? Is water expensive or hard to come by? Is it expensive to travel in an area with such little access?
Food and water are both cheap. We eat a lot of street food, nothing really broke the budget. Water is about 1$ for 1.5 liters in most places.

Is it safer because of its sparse population?
It felt generally safe. We walked around day/night and had no trouble. With that said, there is a lot of military presence everywhere in the capital.

Can you hike the dunes just anywhere? I found the old ship on google earth by following your caption's instructions. Did you hike out to it? Very cool!
The dunes we went to was just North of a town. We did stumble into a military base on our way out but they were nice. Made us sit there while they check passports and made us mint tea and offered sardines. 
For the shipwreck, you can take a shared taxi from to the port and then walk a hour to the wreck. Or you can also take another taxi. We ended up hitching back to town and it was easy.

That was his mindset during the negotiations. He believed he had the upper hand to force a better deal. When it was clear he would not get his way, he dropped the referendum bombshell hours away from the deadline after weeks of talks.  

It was a tactic of last resort. He doesn't care about democracy or the will of the Greek people. He wanted to strong arm the rest of Europe. He was so confident that the EU had to make a deal that he even proposed a third bailout and another debt restructuring. Proposals that as far as I know were either never on the table or always firmly rejected when mentioned. He did all this without even mentioning what Greece was willing to offer in return.  

He dropped these demands in the heat of the moment in a take-it-or-leave-it sort of ultimatum. I don't think he even considered the possibility that they wouldn't accept. He thought Europe would cave for fear of the consequences but he was wrong.  

If Greece votes yes, mos likely Syriza's government falls. If they say no, they crash out of the Euro and the EU. Either way, nobody has to negotiate with Tsipras anymore.

Greece hasn't taken even one single loan *in a year*. It has to be the only country in the capitalistic economy paying the debts from its own coffers with no refinancing *at all*.

&gt; They've had ever more bailout money instead of gradually weaning themselves off and they've made their deficit worse instead of better.

[Less than 10% of the bailout money went to the Greek people](http://jubileedebt.org.uk/press-release/least-90-greek-bailout-paid-reckless-lenders). The other 90% went to bail-out irresponsible private bondholders who gambled and lost.

Greece has had one of the [most brutal fiscal adjustments](http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2012/11/primary-budget-deficits.png) and one of the [most brutal cases of austerity.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CEeWeXKUIAIxYYA.jpg:large). Greece's collapse in GDP is much worse than the Great Depression, the worse case of GDP collapse in the post-WWII history in the western world.

&gt; Greece takes the money meant for reconstruction and squanders it on overly generous social programs and unnecessary civil servants. Then cries it needs more and calls the people giving it money Nazis.

The crisis in Greece is directly correlated with the skyrocketing of the private debt, not the public debt. In 2000-2009, public debt rised 20% while private debt 200%. The huge private debt led to huge public debt in the whole Europe, when they collectively gave the taxpayers money to cover bank losses, not the other way around.

0,2,Capsulets,t5_2qhcv,"&gt;So you're happy to have your products regulated by the EU, and have companies regulated by the EU... but have no control over that regulation? Really?

Obviously you have very little experience working in any sort of industry which is required to adhere to different regulations in different parts of the world, so its not surprising that you don't understand how it works.

To you, having to meet different regulations in different parts of the world seems like a huge undertaking, but for anyone who knows what they are talking about, it is just a part of the job. 

&gt;(which includes our entire Nuclear industry, Water Industry, Rail, Energy, our Pharmacies etc. All of which would be regulated by the EU because they're all owned by European companies), 

You are completely wrong here, where are you getting your information? Any company, UK based or from elsewhere, who wanted to build a nuclear power station in the UK would have to follow OUR regulations, as regulated by the ONR. End of story. 

&gt;In fact we do have a means of regulating how banks in China and banks worldwide operate, its called SWIFT, it's based in Brussels and it controls and operates the network which connects all banks globally. Banks have to meet certain standards to use it, and the EU regulates the trade of foreign owned banks operating within the EU.

SWIFT is a globally agreed standard for sending financial information. Its like saying that E-mail is a form of regulation. In addition, the only country that has ever been denied the use of SWIFT was Iran. And that was only because the US government introduced sanctions against the SWIFT organisation itself, for breaching sanctions in place against Iran. The reasons were political and military, not regulatory. 

&gt;We do indeed have a voting role in regulating American plugs through the International Standards Organisation incidentally.

Sorry but you have no idea what you are talking about. ISO is a mainly industry related body which facilitates the development of international standards in industry. They have never been involved in the development of any domestic ISO wall plug. How could they be? You cannot have a standard UK/US plug/socket without a total overhaul of one countries power network. And that's just creating a standard between 2 countries. 

&gt;The current situation is far from the exception. We are members of the World Trade Organisation via the EU, our interface with NAFTA is through the EU, as is our interface with the Asian Free Trade Area, Indian Free Trade Area, The Common Market For East and Southern Africa and dozens of others - EVERYONE is in a free trade area of some kind, as this handy map shows[1] .png)

Not sure what your point is here. We want more free trade, and leaving the EU would help facilitate that. We could still trade freely with the EU, and also create free trade agreements with the other blocks. 

&gt;Frankly the mendacious crap spewed by the likes of Farage and your self appals me - you're astonishingly ignorant of world trade but sit there and snipe like you know what you're talking about.

The U.S. State Department on Tuesday punched a big hole in Israel-led efforts to induce the Obama administration to regard boycotts of settlements as identical to boycott of Israel proper. In doing so, it provided the Israeli government and the pro-Israel lobby with yet another painful lesson in the pitfalls of being too clever by half and biting off more than one should chew.

A special statement issued by the State Department Press Office on Tuesday afternoon made clear that while the administration “strongly opposes” any boycott, divestment or sanctions against the State of Israel, it does not extend the same protection to “Israel-controlled territories.” Rather than weakening efforts to boycott Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, as Israel supporters had planned, the State Department was actually granting them unprecedented legitimacy.

The statement came in the wake of President Obama’s signing of the Trade Promotion Authority bill, which grants him the authority he had sought to conclude the Trans-Pacific Partnership accord. But as the bill deals with free trade agreements in general, a clause was inserted in the Senate by Democratic Senator Ben Cardin and Republican Senator Rob Portman and by Representative Peter Roskam in the House of Representative that instructs American diplomats to include opposition to any boycott of Israel - or of persons from “territories controlled by Israel” - in their free trade negotiations with the European Union.

The State Department statement, however, makes clear that the bill will not change U.S. policy towards the settlements. “The U.S. government has never defended or supported Israeli settlements or activity associated with them, and, by extension, does not pursue policies or activities that would legitimize them,” it said. It went on to note: “Administrations of both parties have long recognized that settlement activity and efforts to change facts on the ground undermine the goal of a two-state solution.”

The defiant rebuff of the Congressional bill comes in the wake of the recent Supreme Court decision regarding Menachem Zivotofsky that rebuffed Congressional attempts to force the administration to record “Israel” next to his city of birth “Jerusalem.” The State Department statement says, in effect, that a bill on trade authority cannot force the administration to change its longstanding policy towards Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. And just as the Zivotofsky decision weakened Israel’s hold on Jerusalem, the boycott decision only delegitimizes the settlements more than ever before.

Thus, the effort to strengthen the settlements, supported by AIPAC and other mainstream and right-wing groups and opposed by J-Street and organizations on the left, actually ends up weakening them. The attempt to blot out the differences between a boycott of Israel and of the territories actually highlights them. The boycott of settlements, in effect, has now been officially stamped “kosher” by the State Department.",t1_csoiddf,t3_3bpvmc,0,,,,0,False,,1440507291,BDS,False,False,0,1435740513,t3_3bpvmc,csoiddf

Anyway, western Europe or just a portion of southern Europe - particularly Renaissance Italy, differed quite a bit in regards to economics, and Moorish Spain? 

But to further my point, albeit briefly, Wayrest and Daggerfall have been heavily involved with Sentinel to the point it affected the heirs to their kingdoms. The Cumberland Dynasty in Wayrest was started with a Redguard woman and the result of the War on Betony introduced Redguard blood - ugh, I hate using blood in such a manner - to Daggerfall's throne.

And if you want to analyze the Bretons' origins as depicted in the lore - basically sexual slavery and a resulting privileged caste - they mirror the Creoles' quite well, although I think that is more coincidence, but still.

I mean if I go outside and see that happening then me and everyone around would recognise it as such. Who made this rule you're talking about? Sounds like some bullshit invention of the media etc. There's obviously a point as the other reply says about the dynamic of being a minority meaning abuse is systemic. This isn't like a hard fast rule that determines emotion. You can still feel racially abused in a European nation. But it's never gonna be defined in the same way because it's a ""white"" country. It's not the same problem by definition. 

I understand immigration, positive discrimination etc must be a bit strange if you're white. But it's a totally different issue to racism. It's basically politics. When I hear white people in white countries citing these things as racism it honestly comes across as if they know they are taking the piss - like playing on the definition of a word to get air time. It also implies that you really don't understand the vicious hate side of racism. It's really not just a political issue - people used to get hanged and stuff. It just really undermines and distracts I think. You're not suffering racism in England as a white person in the general sense. You might be victim of an incident though. 

I know it's s bit old now, but look at Steven Lawrence. That's a laughably obvious case of racism. And so extreme, complete that they've still not all been done for it. And everyone knows it was them. Vicious racism along with actual corrupt institutional racism meaning the case can never be solved ever. All specifically because of race.

0,8,markgraydk,t5_2wbw4,"We have a new government!

A few weeks ago I wrote about the general election in Denmark that took place on 18 June. As you may remember the results ousted Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt from the Social Democrats for Liberal Lars Løkke Rasmussen. Sunday Løkke completed the rounds of negotiations with supporting parties and presented his cabinet to the Queen. It will be the smallest minority government in a few decades consisting only of Løkke's liberal party Venstre (34 out 179 seats). 

Pundits and commentators predict a rocky and short-lived government since Løkke has to find parliamentary support among parties with diverse views. His primary supporters are the Danish People's Party, a social-conservative, immigration-focused party that came out ahead in the election, the liberal party Liberal Alliance that favors tax cuts but is less concerned about foreigners and the Conservatives that is currently somewhere in-between the two. Together they have a 1 seat majority in parliament and though party loyalty is strong and few expect defection from an MP parties on both sides of the isle may attempt to find alternative majorities outside the government. 

This is perfectly legal with our flavor of parliamentarism but will mean that Løkke will have to work hard at placating both his primary supporters or cross the isle to work with the opposition. Historically many bills do come with participation from parties that formally do not support the government so this is nothing new but extent required here is novel. As an example, the former government of the Social Democrats, Social Liberals and, for a time, the Socialist's People's Party, had to work within the confines of laws and agreements that the Social Liberals had supported with Liberal-Conservative government they ousted in 2011. The laws were mostly on labour market and benefits policy but in general the Social Liberals could with only a minor share of seats (17) largely set the direction on economic and other policies. Parliamentarism can be fun sometimes.

International media have largely called the election a win for xenophobia due to both the rise of the DPP (21% of the vote, 37 seats) and the general discourse during the campaign where several parties campaigned on some form of platform to curtail refugees, immigrants etc. Though I'm personally not happy about the election results a lot of this has been overstated. We will see less support for the EU and new bills on immigration and refugees but in a regional setting the DPP is not as far-right as they sometimes come. 

The upstart party The Alternative had a surprisingly good election. They now have 9 seats but few think they will be able to spend them much for political influence. Situated on the left (best described as a Green party) they support full reserve banking, a reduction of working hours to 30 per week and universal basic income. 

The economic policies of the new government will by and large not change much over the former one. Main differences will be a larger focus on curtailing public sector growth and taxes. There are talks on lowering the top marginal rate as well. Again, due to the slim majority and diverse parties supporting the government (where the DPP is largely center on economic policy) we do not know what the outcome will be. Expectations are that the DPP will negotiate tougher policies on refugees and immigrants for support for the economic policies. We expect a larger labor market and benefits reform this fall and the government seems to have support to lower Danish foreign aid.

Soviet Commanders followed the basic thought process that in a European War scenario their men and material would be chewed up at a horrific rate, like they had during the Second World War, and during the Russian Civil War/Polish-Soviet War. Though the Russian army was always large, it never had the professionalism of the militaries that it opposed, and thus was reliant on making up the difference with weight of numbers/more firepower. This was evidenced in the way they built their vehicles, a T-34's life expectancy on the front lines in World War II was only a few weeks, after that the vehicle/crew would need to be replaced, similarly the T-54/55 was designed in this way.

Even the more sophisticated Soviet vehicles of the time were built with this philosphy in mind, the T-64 is a excellent example. It was a tank specifically built for Elite units of the Soviet military and was in fact kept secret from the West for some time after it's induction into combat units (a lot of this had to do with the fact that it looked very similar to the T-72 but that's neither here nor there). The T-64 was designed around a three man crew, with the idea that by replacing the loader in a tank with a automatic gun loader you could increase the number of vehicles in a unit. Mind you this increased stress and strain the crews as now that extra mans service work for the vehicle fell on them, but more vehicles.

It's somewhat cynical but drawing from the lessons of their past it makes perfect sense. Men and material will not last long in a combat zone and thus must be replaced. It's part of the ""science"" of warfare they believed in.",t1_csoj3fb,t3_3boxwq,0,,,,16,False,,1440507271,CombatFootage,False,False,0,1435743661,t1_csoixlw,csoj3fb

He's still quite young (22) but emerged this season under Bielsa's management as a true potential player. Problem is, he is inconsistent and make poor decisions quite often. Watching Imbula, you'll probably say ""wooo"" quite a few times when he avoids one, two, even three players with small moves and his technique. What he lacks right now is the ability to make the right pass after getting rid of the first line of defense. He musts get rid of the ball quicker in order to make an offensive impact. Also he lacks consistency but surely this will improve over the season, as he still is young. 

He's very, very entertaining to watch.

-----------

**Q: It’s 1961, the height of the Cold War, the U.S. has 40 nuclear-capable Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles--how many ICBMs did the Soviets have?**

According to Daniel Ellsberg’s *SECRETS: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers* (2002):

&gt;However, in the fall of 1961 a highly secret, dramatically revised national intelligence estimate turned the strategic world that had preoccupied me for three years upside down. The missile gap favoring the Soviets had been a fantasy. There was a gap, all right, but it was currently ten to one in our favor. Our 40 Atlas and Titan ICBMs were matched by 4 Soviet SS-6 ICBMs at one launching site at Plesetsk, not by 120, as in the latest national estimate in June, or by the SAC commander’s estimate of 1,000 I had heard of at SAC headquarters in August. The specter of a deliberate Soviet surprise attack suddenly appeared, with the new estimates, to have been a chimera. 

&gt;...the new estimate was kept effectively secret from Congress, the press, and the public, and it had a comparably imperceptible effect on military programs. It was after this secret recognition that the Soviets  had deployed four liquid-fueled ICBMs to our forty that the Kennedy administration decided, in the late fall of 1961, on the appropriate size for the projected force of U.S. solid-fueled Minuteman missiles: one thousand. That was less than the 1,600 to 6,000 that the air force had earlier requested, but it was down only to the level that Secretary McNamara had earlier decided on *before* the new estimate. (pages 32-33)


------------------------

The 6 paragraphs below are taken from Chapter 7 of a free online book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* (2011). Full article ""Follow the Money"" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf

------------------------------

Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effect—“war could come at any time”—was solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.

Why?

The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.

Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.

This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: “As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available.” And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.

Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, “war scares,” otherwise known as “**threat inflation**” would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that “intelligence” had revealed an ominous “gap” between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The “missile gap” on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.

Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies’ capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful “gaps” of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. **The Soviets didn’t announce how much they were spending on defense** (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon “whistleblower” of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, “every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up!” In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.

0,1,_larrystylinson_,t5_2s7k2,"Hey, race is a social construct too. 

It's something placed on you rather than something inherent. A certain group of phenotypes is associated with certain social factors, and this differes from culture to culture. You can be ""white"" and in a Latin American county but be considered ""Hispanic"" in America. Similarly, being Jewish/Irish etc in the early 1900s meant that you were considered ""colored."" Early Asian immigrants to America were considered the same as black people, too, but now we've been given an ""honorary white"" status because of the high levels of education  in (some) ethnic groups. 

I could go on about this for hours. 

Yes, you can look at a person and guess at their ""race,"" but you can never be 100% accurate. Mixed people, ambiguously ethnic people, people of color who pass for white and vice versa (or, like Rachel Dolezal, purposel present themselves that way.) This in itself is proof that race isn't biological. You can't look at someone's DNA and say ""Okay this person is African American and experienced the unique struggles that come with being racialized that way, depending on the time period."" You can only make guesses. ""Oh they have DNA that correlates with 15% Western Europe, 35% North Africa, 27% Pacific Islander and the rest unknown."" 

You're 100% right in saying that sexual orientation is a social construct. As a queer person, I've give a lot of thought to this issue. It's a relatively new concept that a person is naturally inclined toward a certain sex(es). But you know why we need the concept of ""gay"", ""bi;, ""asexual"" etc? Because the world doesn't accept same-sex activity as the norm, at least in most societies. Even in progressive countries, you need to label yourself as Other in order to legitimize your attractions. Everyone has the potential for ""gay"" feelings, but some don't dwell on them, some never get a chance to act on them, some have sex with girls behind their husbands backs but still consider themselves ""straight"" because that's the social group they want to belong to.

It means you can have a deep sense of guilt when really…you have nothing to feel guilty about.
It means your mother will probably have an overbearing presence in most aspects of your life… regrettably this doesn’t fade away just because you’re an adult.
It means you must not show others how well you are doing…it’s frowned upon “Who the feck does yer man think he is?” springs to mind..
It means we drink tea and if we offer you a cup and you say no, well then there’s a fair chance we might assume that you're probably a sex offender.
It means that, by and large, the outside world looks endearingly towards us and that’s warming, I would say we are towards the bottom end of ISIS’s hit list. I’m not sure what we value as a collective people but we are warm people and this appears to have held us in good stead in the opinions and minds of people from across the globe.
I’m not entirely sure what Irish people would view as their identity. Many people are deeply patriotic… then many aren’t. Ireland has changed so much since joining the European Union in 1973. We live in a diverse country with many of our counterparts from neighbouring EU countries. Some people would gripe with immigration, others embrace it.
Our National sport, The GAA http://www.gaa.ie/ , is followed religiously by many. Even those with little interest in the games will gear up towards the latter stages of the competition and get behind their county team. My mother would watch 2 games a year and suddenly become an annoying expert. GAA clubs can now be found in The States, Australia/NZ, The Middle East and many European countries. We are musical people and hold our successful musicians in high esteem…except for Bono of course.

0,2,esmifra,t5_2qh13,"&gt;So think for a minute. Slovakia average salary is 700 Euro. Greece is 1000 Euro.

From what year are those numbers from? Greek wage was cut in average 20%, also average wage alone thoes not show the cost of living in said countries, which in greece due to taxes have sky rocketed.

Also what's the unemployment rate in Slovakia? What is in Greece? 90% of working able population getting 700 euros generates more or less taxes than 75% of working able populations getting 1000 euros?

Every EU country helps every other EU country, that's how EU works. Each country help depends on how strong the economy is, meaning the poorest countries tend to receive more money than the richer. The richer pay more but get massive benefits in the unified economy and market.

&gt;Where is solidarity in that? That is not helping someone poorer, but someone richer who did not worked much and lived from borrowed money.

Now, analyzing Slovakia helping. What happened in 2003, year you were accepted in EU after a couple of years of negotiations and incremental partnership?

""After economic stabilization in 1999 and 2000, Slovakia's current account balance recorded a deficit of 8.2% of GDP in 2002, the second largest number in the country's history (2001 was 8.8%), compared with 3.7% in 2000. However, for the first 10 months of 2003, **the country's trade deficit has dropped by more than 80% compared to 2002, and it has recorded several monthly trade surpluses for the first time in years.** Slovakia had a $2.1 million trade deficit in 2001, and gross foreign debt was about $13.2 billion at the end of 2002, roughly 53% of GDP. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Slovakia has increased dramatically. The Dzurinda government has opened doors for foreign investors and introduced competitive incentives schemes, including a flat income tax for corporations and individuals. **Cumulative FDI has quintupled since the beginning of 2000, and was boosted by large privatization receipts. As of 2002, Slovakia has enjoyed per capita FDI of approximately $1,800.**

**Germany is Slovakia's largest trading partner, purchasing almost 31% of Slovakia's exports and supplying 25% of its imports in the first nine months of 2003.** Other major partners include the Czech Republic (14.4% imports; 13.1% exports), Italy (6.2%; 7.5%), Russia (11.2%; 1%), and Austria (4.4%; 7.2%). Slovakia imports nearly all of its oil and gas from Russia. The country's export markets are primarily Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and EU countries. In 2000, Slovakia received an invitation to join the OECD as its 30th member. **More than 50% of its trade is with EU members.** The United States accounts for about 4% of total trade with Slovakia. The Slovak Republic has most-favored-nation status and receives duty free (GSP) benefits for many of its products.""

[More than 2.100€ per citizen was assigned to Slovakia from 2007-2013 from structural funds of the EU.](http://www.foreign.gov.sk/App/WCM/media.nsf/vw_ByID/ID_DFB9252FC714CEC2C12576A900428551_EN/$File/Slovakia%205%20years%20after%20the%20accession%20to%20the%20EU%20and%20NATO.pdf)

Who do you think pays for these funds? Germany? Let me tell you every single EU country pays for these funds, Slovakia and Greece included depending on how strong their economy is, after every single country paying, the fund is then redistributed by all EU countries depending on how strong the economy is.

[From 2004-2006 Slovakia received more than 1.16B€ from these funds.](http://www.foreign.gov.sk/App/WCM/media.nsf/vw_ByID/ID_DFB9252FC714CEC2C12576A900428551_EN/$File/Slovakia%205%20years%20after%20the%20accession%20to%20the%20EU%20and%20NATO.pdf)

Every single state pays, every single state receives. [Here you can see right at Table 1 how much slovakia paid and received per year.] (http://uni-nke.hu/uploads/media_items/ludmilla-lipkova_ten-years-of-slovakias-membership-in-the-eu.original.pdf)

Not taking into account inflation, **the surplus that Slovakia has received from this funds in the last 10 years ascends to more than 7 Billion euros**. And now that you have to pay a few hundred millions to a country in dire need you complain?

I see a lot of downvotes on my comments.  Not sure why?  My point is that people can travel frugally if they make it a high priority.  Is it easy or cheap?  No.  But people spend equivalent amounts of money on other forms of entertainment that equals similar amounts on a yearly basis.  If you are willing to be flexible, not stay in 5 star hotels, a trip to Europe off season can be done for less than $2,000 for a 7-10 day trip.  This is 6% of the price of the average new car sold in America.  Expensive, yes.  But not astronomical or out of reach for somebody who is working an average job.

&gt;

&gt;The __Australian Natives' Association__ (ANA), a [mutual society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_society) was founded in [Melbourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) in April 1871 as the Victorian Natives' Association.

&gt;In 1872 it voted to extend membership to men born in the other Australian colonies and changed its name at the same time.   The Association played a leading role in the movement for Australian [federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Australia) in the last 20 years of the 19th century. In 1900 it had a membership of 17,000, mainly in [Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia\)).

&gt;The ANA provided sickness, medical and funeral cover. Membership in the ANA was restricted to men born in Australia, at a time when Australian-born people of European descent (not including [Indigenous Australians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians)) were rising to power in place of an older generation born in Britain. In the 1890s, for the first time, they became the majority of the population. The ANA consisted mainly of energetic middle-class men aged under 50 - a perfect base for a forward-looking, idealistic movement such as federation. In 1880 the ANA committed itself to the federation of the Australian colonies, and provided much of the organisational and financial support for the Federation Leagues which led the campaign, particularly in Victoria. It avoided party politics, but they soon adopted the rising liberal politician and ANA member [Alfred Deakin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Deakin) as their candidate for leadership of the federal movement.

Greece was given easy loans when it joined the EU which was spent on consumption. The banking industry thought Greeks would be just as irresponsible as Americans were with credit. The difference is Americans blindly pay their debt off over time, the Greeks didn't. Greeks took the free credit and had fun with it and afterwards told the creditors to come and repose the toys they bought. One Greek town had a very high Porsche per capita ownership.

Greek government debt kept growing because of compound interest. Compound interest leads to money flowing out of a particular region causing DEFLATION. Look what the solutions presented were, massive wage cuts(which kill the economy) all in the name of unrepayable debt.

Is someone a homeowner where 100% of the home is owned by the bank? If you strip out people that owe balances on their homes, the ""ownership rate"" plunges. How is it possible that there are still so many people in debt after decades upon decades of payments? Because no productive force can keep up with compounding debt via compound interest. Entire regions fall into deflationary spins from money being drained out of them. The US is one example(detroit) after another.

Then factor the amount we donate in aid and the numbers we take in through asylum.

I've no quarrel with us sending aid and if it was more transparent and if it actually got to the people who desperately need it, I'd be open to actually increasing it. Especially in education and healthcare. A few extra euro out of my paycheck isn't going to break me. But completely opening our borders won't solve the problem at source.

They didn't. Look at their debt before the buyout before saying things like that.

They had an unsustainable growth true, and an unsustainable spending. But as long as the economy and the euro zone kept growing this would have not reached this point. 

I'm not saying they are saints, they were taking advantage of the EU model. But don't you think EU is just helping them out of the good will. German banks are profiting like bastards from this for example.

The economic crisis in 2008 fucked everyone, US included. Those with strong economies had several ways of getting out of it. Like the US.

Flawed models like the Greek were screwed. And the bail out was to help them pay the massive interests that the markets were demanding to pay them.

Now, US printed a lot of money, that allways helps in this situation. Greece has no way of printing money, and Germany has no interest in it. So the only way of trying to reproduce the same effects is increasing taxes and lowering wages. But unlike printing money, that stimulates a little the country economy, those alternatives measures I mention slow down the economy, making less and less revenue to the government. increasing the deficit, meaning increasing the debt, so the government has to take more measures, less pensions, more taxes, less subsidies, less wages. But the economy reflects it and slows even more, generating less and less money for the government.

You see where this is going?

Germany could have printed more money, could have centralized the debt rate in order to stabilize it, but they didn't because it would hurt them. And this way the banks cash in a lot more.",t1_csolxj6,t3_3bomts,0,,,,1,False,,1437488699,worldnews,False,False,0,1435754017,t1_csolqm8,csolxj6

That is not right wing, but mainstream. And correct.

&gt;Let's tone down the explicit gay content.

Not a common view. The common view is: I dont care what somebody's sexual orientation is, and neither should you! The overall perspective on gay rights is overwhelmingly positive: https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3b7haj/gay_marriage_is_legal_celebration_thread/

&gt; I don't care what psychologists say, your chromosomes determine your gender.

This goes against what most Gators believe. You can peruse my user history as a datapoint, I am in a discussion about this right now on another threat.

&gt;Feminism has gone far enough.

The formulation is wanting , a more accurate paraphrase would be along the lines ""several modern incarnations of feminism are totalitarian and harmful to the liberal cause"". I give you that gamergate mostly believes that. Incidentally this one is also simply correct on almost every relevant metric. Having beliefs in accordance with reality is not intrinsically right wing.

&gt;here should be more alternatives to the liberal media.

There should not be alternatives? I cannot even believe that this is your view. I think far more different opinions should be heard in the media than the current hegemony, including both left and right.

&gt; I'm voting Republican next time!

Americacentrism is always amusing to a european. And no, I will not vote conservative in the next election and I never have.

&gt;And everyone who has risen to prominence seems to be unabashedly right wing, and not just a little bit, either. 

Complete and utter nonsense. E.g. Thunderf00t is not rightwing. You can go back on his posting history and see his vicious crticism of conservative campaigns in the past.

&gt;I believe gamergate's perception of itself as left wing is based on a poll which asked them to self-identify their political stance. 

No, it was what their consistent answers were on the political compass test . I have additionally taken several other poll metrics. I always cluster far liberal left.

&gt;Gamergate clearly wants to think of itself as left wing. I'm just not sure how accurate that is.

As someone who reads wide parts of conservative and liberal media, I would say it is quite accurate.",t1_csomb5s,t3_3bq6ux,1,,Pro-GG,,1,False,,1437488994,AgainstGamerGate,False,1435755943,0,1435755005,t1_csoluxe,csomb5s

0,3,Etular,t5_2qh4j,"&gt;Internally, America is far from perfect but we're sure as hell doing better than you lot, who are days away from LOSING a member state and have likely set back the European integration project by decades (meaning that Europe will continue to be geopolitically impotent well into the 21st century). And our economy is doing better, by a lot. 

The problem, of course, was a corruption issue: Greece was never eligible to join the EU in the first place. We're fixing a past mistake by kicking them out, and it's charity alone that we're offering them a chance to stay.

As far as the European integration project, that was set back the moment the 2008/9 Wall Street Crash happened and everyone started blaming ""those immigrants from the new EU member states"", leading to the rise of ""eurosceptic"" anti-immigrationist parties across Europe.

&gt;We didn't bother with this austerity hogwash.

You never really had any public spending on welfare to begin with, though, did you?

I may disagree with the effectiveness of austerity, but to any European, your country is a state which was always in constant austerity measures.

&gt;America has a lot of problems, but you lot are way worse off. You're going to spend decades figuring out the ramifications of importing so many Arabs (among whom there is too significant a radical minority, and in general are poorly integrating).

This is laughable coming from a country who imports 19.8% of the world's immigrants (compared to second place Russia, at 4.8%).

By all means, there's nothing wrong with immigration, but there is something very ironic about the world's biggest importer of immigrants making the xenophobic argument. If I was a racist, I could just as easily say ""The reason you have so many problems is because of African Americans/Mexicans!"". Thing is, I'm not a racist.

&gt;Also, the kind of blatant characterization of America as an ultranationalist police state is just the kind of ignorant crap I'd expect from one who had never been there or researches the issue more deeply than reading Gawker articles. Nasty issues like the strength of the Republican party, incarceration rates, are already deeply into positive trends. The worst of the nation's poverty issues will also positively trend over the next few decades as the Republicans weaken.

I guess the only answer I can give is ""I'll believe that when I see it"". Given your anti-Arab beliefs, it seems that the Republicans will always have a platform.

At the moment, looking at the here and now, the only thing America really has is the money they stole from the Old World. Other than that, America is a failure. The same criticisms can be levelled at it as are at China, or Zimbabwe - ""It's got a select few rich people, but the rest are in poverty"".

&gt;One of the things you Europeans mess up most badly is your focus on income inequality as a singular evil. America is and will continue to be the only country in the world (with to a lesser extent Israel) where a single person with an idea can *really* strike it big. America's utter dominance in scientific progress reflects this. I live in Denmark currently, and I can *really* see the extent to which the country sabatoges itself with equality policies and attitudes run rampant.

Really? Have you tried measuring so-called ""scientific progress"" on a per capita basis? After all, you're attributing ""scientific success"" solely to a large population by studying its nominal figure.

Analogy, I know, but for the academic field I'm currently studying, it's rare I ever see an American name. Mostly, French, German or British.

&gt;You Europeans couldn't even handle Bosnia, Russia, or heck, even FIFA on your own. Remember that.

If your claim is ""We have a bigger military than you!"", I'll take your claim that we're not a continent of warmongers as a compliment.

As for FIFA, it's worth noting that many of us simply don't care. Sepp Blatter was based in Switzerland, but none of us (on a state level, anyway) cared nearly enough to do anything more than complain. That your country intervened, the same as it does everywhere (normally screwing everything over in the process), is hardly something to be proud of.

Allereerst wil ik de heer KrabbHD bedanken voor zijn vragen.

Ik zal bij zijn laatste punt beginnen. De heer KrabbHD kaart aan dat de groep mensen met rijbewijs maar zonder paspoort relatief klein is. Ik heb daar geen cijfers over tot mijn beschikking, maar ik kan me voorstellen dat dit klopt. Echter zult de heer KrabbHD het met mij eens zijn dat men vaker een rijbewijs dan een paspoort bij zich heeft. Als ik nu mijn portemonnee opentrek...

*opent portemonnee*

...dan haal ik daar mijn rijbewijs uit...

*laat rijbewijs zien*

...echter heb ik mijn paspoort alleen bij mij als ik bewust op reis ga. Het paspoort is een geschikt document voor landen waar een reisvisum nodig is, binnen de EU is dit niet het geval.

Met name in de grensstreek van Nederland zou een verdrag dat het rijbewijs een reisdocument maakt veel gemak opleveren.

Verder kaart de heer KrabbHD een tekort aan op het rijbewijs ten opzichte van de identiteitskaart. Tja, meneer de voorzitter, daar heeft hij natuurlijk gelijk. Echter is het natuurlijk logisch daar een verklaring voro te bedenken: het rijbewijs is momenteel geen reisdocument. De oplossing is dan ook simpel, een nieuw rijbewijs bevat wel de gegevens die nodig zijn ter identificatie. Om de zoveel jaar worden nieuwe rijbewijzen uitgebracht, ik stel dan dus ook voor deze aanpassing in de volgende cyclus mee te nemen. Alleen nieuwe(re) rijbewijzen zouden zodoende als reisdocument geldig zijn.

Dit is een aanpassing die weinig investering vergt, die de bevolking gemak oplevert en die makkelijk implementeerbaar is in samenwerking met onze Europese partners.

This is an interesting point, because I've gradually recognized that the system is an illusion nowadays. Whatever profits people think they've made following a statist mindset is going to evaporate in an instant when a collapse comes. For example, people will have wonderful and pristine houses in the suburbs and then the real estate bubble bursts and they are left bewildered.

So when I see things like twitter or iPhones making a big stir in society, I don't jump on the bandwagon. Heck I still don't really have a facebook account. How many people are regretting giving all their personal data to the government through facebook now?

My point here is that fake, statist programs produce fake, statist results. The stock market can go to the moon for all I care, it's the wrong mindset to produce real success.

&gt; You are exchanging ""real capital"" for different ""real capital""

Let me change this into the context of political systems and markets. What you're telling me (as I see it) is that if we produce an ancap utopia with a ""free market"", we're just exchanging todays ""free market"" for that one. What I'm saying here though is that there is no free market (i.e. capital in the stock market) today and it's all a lie.

&gt;&gt; when the US hegemony falls, then demand for such a business will pick up in the future.

&gt; What is the logic behind such a fantastic statement?

Today the US economy is primarily service (something like 85% I think). Without goods imported from China, then having a service industry is rather pointless. 

So imagine what will happen if china stops selling stuff to the US. The plumber won't have toilets to install. The clothing store won't have clothes to sell. Walmart won't have any of the plastic toys on their selves. The hardware store won't have any tools.

Greece is the same way right now. they apparently don't produce much of anything locally and they're a service economy. When they're shut off from the EU, then they're going to have to start begging russia to send them aid or else they will have to restart their own manufacturing economy back up.

So my point is that, we as capitalists need to start businesses in the same manner as 19th century industrialists did. We'll need means of manufacturing stuff for when China stops selling to the US.

&gt;&gt; Nobody will be able to afford the expensive equipment (e.g. CNC machine)

&gt; You just said the valuation of the asset would increase.

Right, which is why after a collapse there will be higher demand for manufacturing assets.

Greece wasn't the only country that shouldn't have been allowed.

This continued when the crash happened, Greece decided to blame people and demand money. Ireland and Portugal again fixed the problems even if they weren't totally their fault and progressed.

People always say the Greek situation was the worst in the EU so you can compare them and that's true but it was worse because Greece didn't invest correctly so it's still their own fault. 

The euro itself was a disaster but it hand to be to work. If they had tighter regulation nobody would join, so you keep it unregulated, enjoy the short term massive influx of investment that is completely unsustainable and deal with the inevitable issues when they occur.

When the French at the Battle of Crécy tried to deploy crossbows against English longbows without these shields, they were massacred by the sheer volume of fire.

The one drawback (heh) is that the English longbowmen were only truly effective during the starting battles of the Hundred Year War such as Crecy. During later battles at Verneil and Patay, the french cavalry adjusted their tactics and charged their lines before they had time to set up, or were completely broken anyway.

Crossbows had actually superseded handbow use in Europe during the 12th century, roughly 200 years before the Longbow was even adopted by the English. Although the English never adopted widespread use of Crossbows (owing to their militarized usage of the Longbow, which eventually was replaced when firearms came around), crossbow projectiles held comparable kinetic impact, only took a week at most to effectively train and shoot with, and was much smaller to carry around. The Longbow took years of strength training to even draw back to release a single shot.",t1_csoosss,t3_3boxp4,0,1,House Stark,,1,False,,1440507051,gameofthrones,False,False,0,1435760284,t1_csoofmv,csoosss

But I think the largest factor in this could be discovery of dinosaur fossils and trying to explain them.

Tsipras, instead of supporting a nominee for president, toppled the last government. The call for election had to come from the prime minister. That's how things work in a parliamentary democracy. It doesn't change that Tsipras made a grab for power or that, like populist politicians since the dawns of time, he put his desire for power above his nation's need. 

He won the election? How very Syriza of you. Only 63% voted. Syriza got a lot less than half that. They secured roughly one vote for every four registered voters. A percentage, as you seem fond of fascist references, not so dissimilar to another nationalist, socialist party led by a populist politician with a penchant for fiery speeches and empty promises at an earlier time of European crisis. He had his supporters too. They, like you, resorted to name calling when confronted by facts.

[Syriza received just over two million votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_legislative_election,_2015). And it is using that to hold a country of 11 million people ransom and to blackmail and entire continent. More than half a billion souls held hostage by the deluded demands of a populist politician. And you accuse me of being fascist? 

The pity is that your allegiances come with such potentially tragic outcomes for a country you have no actual involvement with or no investment in. Were it not so serious, it would be hilarious watching childlike intellects attempting to grapple with the realities of the adult world. Unfortunately, it is serious.

0,1,[deleted],t5_2qh13,"&gt; Did you know that Greece used the bail out money to bail out a bank?

Of course I do! The whole point of this is to bail out the banks! 91% of the money that Greece is being strong-armed into borrowing goes straight from the Troika to Greece, then from Greece to the banks who hold Greek debt, without any Greek person getting to even look at it! It's obscene and those banks should be allowed to fail! They should've been allowed to fail back in 2008! 

&gt;and they squandered the money they were given to fix themselves.

They weren't given any money to ""fix themselves"" they were given money to pay back loans to prevent (mainly French and German) banks from taking the hit. They've been instructed to make vast public expenditure cuts to help pay off these odious debts.

The Austerity package was insisted upon by the IMF, the Eurogroup and the ECB, and it was done in order to rescue banks not people. The blame lies wholly and entirely with a) the European banks b) the troika and c) PASOK and New Democracy, who carried out the murderous austerity program, with the consequences we've now seen.",t1_csopesp,t3_3bomts,0,,,,1,False,,1440507018,worldnews,False,False,0,1435761352,t1_csop6i5,csopesp

0,1,Jupilaire,t5_2re9k,"Well, well it's hard to tell you without knowing your tastes, because many festivals are genre-related festivals. Also many great festivals happen before August. Still in August you have some very good ones. I'd say the best festivals in general are the Pukkelpop (20-22) in Belgium, the Sziget (10-17) in Hungary (on a Island), or the Leeds or Reading Festival both in the UK (28-30). Honnestly, I'd go for the Pukkelpop. Short, amazing and you can quickly get back on track in your journey, because of Brussels location and access to many different high speed trains. Germany and Sweden have many great festivals also.

If you put the heat aside and if you want a lot of action, I would visit the South first like the Mediterranean coasts of France and Spain, if you want to have some nice partying by the beach. Then you could move on to inner lands and mive slowly towards the festival. Some capitals like Paris, Berlin, Madrid are also cool to visit because they're never stopping beating hearts that have to keep on going for the ones staying and working. Amsterdam is also a must-go. The nordic countries are also great to visit. 

Now keep in mind, you don't want to spend days and days in the train. Spain, France, Germany, Belgium, England and the Nederlands are all very well connected through the high speed trains (TGV, Thalys, Eurostar, ICE, etc.). You will have to pay a bit everytime for reservations but you will cross these countries in no time. 
Countries like Croatia are also great, but keep in mind it'll take you longer with transports and not necessarily offer you the fun you're searching for.

0,1,elsparkodiablo,t5_2cneq,"&gt; What are you arguing???? What does gun regulation have anything to do with banning liquor and drugs?

Firearms crime is a symptom of much larger issues.  Stricter gun regulation isn't going to change that people are still going to murder each other over drug profits.  See: Roaring 20's, War on Drugs, Mexico, etc

The people killing each other over illicit narcotics (and alcohol back in the day) don't care about any restrictions you put up.

&gt; This is just a terrible argument. First, you assume that all or the majority of crimes are drug crimes. Second, almost every other wealthy country in the world has proven that highly regulating guns has lead to positive outcomes. Even if half of the US homicides were drug related, we would still have 2x to 3x the homicide rate of other wealthy countries. And you're assuming those other countries don't have drug problem either...they have criminal drug dealers as well.

A sizable number of crimes are drug crimes or gang related, yes.  Second, cherry picking ""wealthy countries"" ignores their lack of gang violence, war on drugs, etc.  If you think that Europe's drug problems are anything like those in the US, you are utterly uninformed.  Third, you ignore cultural differences that lead the US to be a more violent place, just like places like Japan &amp; South Korea have higher suicide rates than the US (despite a lack of guns).  

In short, you aren't very good at logic or reason.

&gt; Analogies aren't your strong point. And neither is logic. Guns don't' cause ALL crimes but guns FACTOR into crimes. Just like if you legalized machine guns and grenades, you can bet homicide rates would increase. But your ignorant logic would say ""machine guns and grenades don't cause crimes, people cause crimes"".

Machineguns and grenades are perfectly legal, please stop spouting off ignorant nonsense.  They are regulated under the 1934 NFA.  This is why you aren't equipped for this discussion, you aren't even aware of current laws, much less the likely outcomes of what you fervently wish passed.   Until you can show you have a laymans grasp of current firearms laws, stop posting bullshit like this.

This rig should suit your needs just fine. Xeon 1231 is basically an i7, but without the integrated HD4600 GPU which a)kinda sucks and b) not needed since you will be getting GTX 970. Main advantage of i7 over i5 - better load balancing due to having HT, which means higher performance per clock speed, and also better longevity - with Xeon 1231, you are pertty much safe from having to worry about your CPU for the next 4 years - you will be able to just upgrade your GPU once 970 becomes obsolete, and not overhaul half of the rig. 

CPU water cooling - not necessary when overclocking, and also, its actually quite noisy due to water pumps. Unless you buy an expensive unit that is. But if you are worried just about the noise - stock cooler is generally ok for the first year, then you will need to buy something like CoolerMaster TX3, or another cheap but good aftermarket cooler, because stock coolers have shitty bearings that wear out quickly and thus become noisy as the rig gets older.

GTX 970 is indeed the best choice for a living room PC, due to it having amazingly low thermals for the performance it gives, which means less noise as the cooling system is less stressed. That said - Strix is good, but since you are from EU, you have an option of buying Palit JetStream which is just as [quiet](http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/palit_geforce_gtx_970_jetstream_review,10.html), but is cheaper due to it being lesser known brand. 

Other than that - you have an SSD for OS and 1 TB hdd. Fully modular PSU for easier cable management. 8 GB of system memory, with an option to add 8-16GB more. Cheap but good all-black case. 1080p 60Hz IPS monitor. 

Compared to that pre-built, you have better CPU, better SSD, less fancy case, and no SLI capacity. And also monitor. ",t1_csoqch8,t3_3bqv5k,0,,,,2,False,,1437492048,buildapcforme,False,False,0,1435762936,t3_3bqv5k,csoqch8

There are two options Ukraine can take when they don't want to pay Russia for their gas or Russia are unwilling to pay for their gas. The first one is they can buy gas Russia intends for the EU form the EU. This usually happens when Ukraine cannot afford to pay their gas bill and Russia refuses to sell anymore to them, they still get the Russian gas albeit at a higher price. The second is that they just straight up take the gas which off course increases their debt with Russia. Of course Russia can cut off the gas in retaliation but this also leaves them unable to supply a portion of their gas to the EU.

Currently their is a price negotiation and Ukraine refuses to pay the money owed it would seem until they get a better price, to which Russia have responded by not selling them gas, however there is still gas flowing through their pipes so they have these two options that I mentioned although they both come with negative consequences, time will tell who cracks first.

We may have to resort to geoengineering when the effects of global warming become more apparent, but there are a number of plausible and surprisingly cheap things we can do in that eventuality, and there's going to be an enormous amount of funding available for researching those possibilities once the economy begins to be affected.

Oh, so now they have low crime rates. Or perhaps you are dumb enough to think that *reported violent crime rates* is the same as *actual violent crime rates*.  European countries and other western countries have a culture and laws that ENCOURAGE victims to come forward. Not only that, but these other wealthy countries typically have a much broader definition of what is included as a violent crime....since these countries are more interested in stopping crimes.  That's why most experts typically focus on homicide rate since it's hard to not report a homicide and it's hard to categorize it as a different kind of crime. People in poor countries usually don't report crimes because they either don't trust their police or have weak policing or don't trust the prosecutors.

0,1,confuseDbirT,t5_2qh4j,"&gt;They didn't take advantage of the poor poor Greeks. They took &gt;advantage of almost all of Europe. It's just the Greeks were the &gt;ones most affected, because, well, we're the most retarded. &gt;Culturally, socially, economically, and on most days mentally too.

How can you say that they took advantage? Germany did reforms when they were considered the weak old man in Europa and now it is enjoying its benefits or let us say that the companies are enjoying the benefits of the reforms. 

In my opinion you cannot call this taking advantage. Everybody in the Euro zone KNEW what they were getting into. Everybody knew that once you are in you cannot devalued your currency to increase your competitiveness. These are all economic realities which a first semester undergrad student understands, therefore you cannot lay the blame on others. And it is not only Germany which is more competitive than South Europe. There are also several other countries that are, basically all of the Northern once.   
Are they all taking advantage?

And do you believe that if a company is not competitive enough and pushed out of business that the other, more competitive companies are to blame? 
That is just how our system works and everybody knows that. If you are not willing to deal with this do not open a company or to put it into perspective: do not join the Euro zone. 

Btw. Greece also had some really good years in regard to their economy after joining the zone and if they would have invested the loans they took better they might be more competitive right now, but instead the money was wasted on government employees and consumption. Just one bad business decision after another, all of them could have been stopped by Greece, but none were.
Greece - and other countries - did not do their homework. It all comes down do that in the end. In one market jobs will go to the most competitive country and if you cannot keep up you get left behind. It is not some kind of evil plan by the Northern countries it is just how our capitalist, globalized economy works. 
The thing is: everybody knew. It is nothing new. 

&gt;With regards to the low interest rates, you are right, they are &gt;too low. But think of this. Either you have a single &gt;currency/market &gt;and therefore should strive for the &gt;federalization of the european &gt;government and economy, or &gt;you have a loose trade treaty. This &gt;middle ground only favours &gt;countries that have their houses in &gt;order. Another reason the &gt;interest rates are low is because they &gt;can perpetuate this &gt;situation, lower the risk and the lenders &gt;actually earn money on &gt;their loans.

I am not talking about the situation right now. You totally misunderstood me. The interest rate right now is low because the ECB wants to stimulate the economy which is a good move in my opinion. 

&gt; It appears that fudging numbers is a pan-european sport and &gt;it's hypocritical of european powers to play that card.

Please give me a reliable source that states that Germany or France faked their numbers in order to get into the Euro zone, because I do not believe that for a second.

&gt;In Greece it was the opposite, the state caused the banks to &gt;collapse. You don't get to rebuild a national economy by &gt;destroying wages, making firing laws liberal, making cuts here, &gt;there, everywhere. That's catastrophic in both theory and &gt;practice. You either let the economy default or demand specific &gt;institutional change in the way the economy works. By choosing &gt;the easy way of lending money in exchange for reform, the plan &gt;was doomed from the start. Greeks managed to mess up their &gt;economy royally. What makes anyone on earth think they can &gt;set it right by themselves?

I have to disagree with your statement that you do not get to rebuild a national economy by lowering wages and liberalization of the labor market. Greeces problem is that its wages are to high for its productivity. Therefore wages need to be lowered or the productivity needs to increase, which is much more difficult. 

A more liberalized labor market also can help to make the businesses more competitive. All of that is necessary since Greece can not just devalued its currency and be done with it, unfortunately  there is NO other way to fix the problem.
You want jobs? Then become more competitive and provide a political stable framework. Do your god damn homework!

I do not think that it should have been done that fast or that Greece should have sold all its national treasures (harbors f.e.), but it needs to be done if Greece is to remain in the Euro zone. On the other hand I am not sure if it could have been done slower, because that would have required more money and maybe Greece would just have played on time again, again and again.

What happened instead is that the appellants argued that the powers delegated to the EU were too broad and vague, and that therefore the ratification was illegal for that reason (the case is usually cited as Carlsen v Rasmussen). The court rejected their argument.

So...having started by arguing about whether the Danish government had ignored a binding referendum No to Maastricht, we find that the Danish government did not ignore the referendum that produced a No, but sought opt-outs, after which it held another referendum that produced a Yes, only after which it ratified Maastricht. Both referendums were binding, and treated as such.

Nor were the referendums challenged, nor was the ratification found to be in any sense legally dubious. Folk-memory of a disappointment, like I said.

&gt; 
&gt; There is a direct flow of a great deal of money from Germany, UK, France etc into places like Romania, Greece, Poland, Bulgaria etc.

This claim is as frequently repeated as it is inaccurate. 

The current amount of federal-level spending for the EU is approximately 1% of its GDP. In the best case, this would have to more than double to play a non-negligible role in shock absorption and stabilisation.

Don't believe me? [Here what everyone's favourite central banker, Mario Draghi, had to say on the issue:](http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ecb-eurozone-economic-union-by-mario-draghi-2015-1-2015-01)

&gt; In other political unions, cohesion is maintained through a strong common identity, but often also through permanent fiscal transfers between richer and poorer regions that even out incomes ex post. In the euro area, such one-way transfers between countries are not foreseen (transfers do exist as part of the EU’s cohesion policy, but are limited in size and are primarily designed to support the “catching-up” process in lower income countries or regions). This means that we need a different approach to ensure that each country is permanently better off inside the euro area.

Not convincing enough? No problem, here's what the [MacDougall report](http://ec.europa.eu/archives/emu_history/documentation/chapter8/19770401en73macdougallrepvol1.pdf), which was tasked with figuring out what the prerequisites for a workable monetary union should be, said back in 1977 on the issue:

&gt; The need for redistribution between member states arises partly because the process of economic integration, which may confer net gains in the aggregate, does not necessarily raise the economic welfare in all areas. The changing pattern of production and exchange that characterizes an integrating Community typically brings gains to some but loses to others. To make integration acceptable to all participants may thus require an explicit redistributive mechanism to divide the gains from integration in a politically acceptable way.

&gt; Failure to attend to this matter may at the least result in stagnation of the integration process, and at the worst result in secession and dissolution.

Here's another part talking about how much a bigger federal budget would be needed:

&gt; As regards the general level of economic activity, the instruments remain very. largely in national hands, but since public expenditure at the Community level might rise from the present level of 0.7 % to 2-2.5% of gross product, it might be possible for Community finance to play some part in stabilisation and growth policy.

But wait, there's more:

&gt; Ambitious plans for monetary integration have failed and have relapsed into selective club arrangements (the osnake'). Despite some divergence, rather than con- vergence, of economic performance between the most and least prosperous member states, integration is nonetheless proceeding, in an uneven and often modest way, in quite a number of public sectoral activities through financing, regulation and coordination (eog. in development aid, regional policy, environmental policy, industrial and commercial norms and con- ditions of competition). 

What is [this snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_in_the_tunnel) you ask? Just the failed precursor to the ERM. What is the ERM? The [failed precursor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Wednesday) to the euro (also that failure is the reason why the UK is so adamantly opposed to the euro). 

Face it: without addressing the issue of shock absorbers / surplus recycling, any fixed exchange rate system, no matter how tight, is doomed to failure. 

This isn't some sort of secret forgotten knowledge either. Last year the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion László Andor [made a long lecture on the issue, outlining the problem and possible solutions](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-14-455_en.htm). Even the recent [5 presidents' report](https://euobserver.com/economic/129218) hints in this direction, [albeit too cautiously to make a difference.](http://www.cer.org.uk/insights/eurozones-five-presidents-report-assesment)

0,1,linklater11,t5_2qh13,"&gt; On point 1, I'd like a source please! The one you've listed above is Greece in 2012 promising a 2013+ primary surplus, something it failed to achieve. Get me a reputible source where they show an actual primary surplus and I'll shut up. But not a projected one. Greece has been projecting surpluses for years without (happy to be proved wrong) achieving one.

All you have to do is do a google search. [Here](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/23/greece-primary-idUSB5N0N100B20140423) a Reuters article saying European Commission acknowledges a primary surplus. [Here](http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1551-greek-choices-after-the-elections/) is an analysis of Bruegel, one of the most well-esteemed think tanks in Europe, you will find a primary surplus graph there. It is interesting to note that in 2012 bail-out conditions, had Greece achieved a primary surplus, there would be a debt relief. But we said it before ""Rules are rules, but not for us."" 

&gt; On point 2: i have to ask Why? Why plunge the country into endless referendums, stock market shocks, capital controls and all the other measures if you have a primary surplus? If Greece has a primary surplus, it does not need to borrow. It can default and carry on as if nothing ever happened. It doesn't have to endure any more austerity, speak to the IMF or leave the eurozone. And even if Greece were to want to pay back the money out of duty, it would be in a position to do so on its own terms over whatever period it liked.

Don't be fooled, Greece is in chaos *right now* for two reasons: 1) Due to the economical strangulation by ECB, not providing liquidity to banks per its mandate (which states that ELA is for solvent but illiquid banks, Greek banks are both) but acting politically. 2) Due to not being able to refinance its debts as every country in the world. 

You are thinking in very naive terms. If Greece defaults, ECB will pull out liquidity since state can't provide for banks and it's most likely a de facto Grexit. The main reason Greece cannot do anything and the main reason of the European crisis is one: the euro. The monetary union is rotten to its core with severe structural imbalances that need to be addressed. There is no doubt that the Eurozone will collapse, if nothing changes. And right now, it seems very likely.

The current program has failed and it cannot continue. Creditors were asking 4% primary surpluses in a depressed economy, *just to pay an unsustainable debt*, which ensures with mathematical accuracy to stay depressed forever since it affects GDP multiplicatively.

As for the referendum, I would have no problem if it was actually substantial. As of right now, my understanding is that it is a farce. 

&gt; The fact Greece has not run a surplus for decades (happy to be proved wrong) is what makes it reliant on lenders (first bond markets then the troika) and that is what let's them dictate terms. As soon as Greece runs a primary surplus, it can tell everyone where to stick it. The fact Greece can't keep its cash machines stocked or it's banks open without the troika makes me doubt your position. But that's fine, shut me up! * 

Greece cannot tell anyone to ""stick it"" because it simply means a de facto Grexit which would lead to catastrophic results, at least short term. Greece, and the periphery as a whole, is hostage to to a German-led euro and there is nothing they can do about it.",t1_csouku4,t3_3bmszf,0,,,,1,False,,1437495416,worldnews,False,False,0,1435769419,t1_csosqu1,csouku4

&gt; Why do we need rules for net neutrality?

&gt; Net neutrality is crucial for users and businesses.

This is also very important for start-up businesses that commercialise their products and services via the Internet **and need to be able to compete on an equal footing with larger players.**

A two class internet would, without a doubt, be in the way of their reasoning that startups have to be able to compete with big players. This is actively preventing it, but you're only picking quotes that could be interpreted in such a way that a two class internet would be possible. 

What the paragraph you quoted (and bolded) actually explains is no different from a corporate internet access today: better customer service, more bandwidth and more guaranteed uptime. That's not ""two class internet"", that's ""which plan is best for me? Do I need 1GB/s UP/DOWN?"".

[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1bsivr/was_india_ever_really_an_economic_superpower/) is a thread on Indian economy back then. I don't know what you meant by major powers, but the Mughals fought plenty too. In those times, the Europeans were not the only major power.

And all that wealth didn't stop Nadir Shah from waltzing in. The Ottomans fought the Spanish and Portuguese from Africa to Asia. The Holy Roman Empire in Europe, the Russians in the North and the Safavids in Iran. All at once. When the Portuguese terrorized the red sea, the Muslims asked the Ottomans for help. When Portugal occupied the Gulf of Persia it was the Ottomans that purified the Gulf. When Portugal attacked Morocco, the Ottomans crushed the Portuguese invasion. When Portugal terrorized East African Muslims, the Ottomans came to their help. When Portugal took Goa who sent an army to dislodge them? Ylu guessed it. When today's Indonesia was getting  overran by the Dutch the Sultanate of Aceh sent emissaries to the Caliph of the Muslims, the Ottoman sultan, who sent them cannons and cannon makers to teach them to make their own. 
When Russia was taking over Muslims lands it was the Ottomans who sent aid and armies. 

Tell me of one Mughal military action that didn't involve invading Afghans or other Indian powers. 

&gt;Regarding the Caliphate, the Islamic tradition states that one can only be proclaimed in consultation with the [Shura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shura). A Caliphate needs acceptance all over the Ummah, which was lacking for the Ottomans.


That's a ridiculous theoretical standard not even attained by the greatest caliphate of them all, the Abbasids much less the Ottomans.

The very nature and design of fringe radicalism is, barring violent revolution, to enact a drastic shift in the Overton window in order to spur meaningful sociopolitical change.

In terms of charm, no city can compare. Rich history, super cheap food and drinks. The thing is that I had poor internet in both the flats I stayed. Every cafe has wifi, which wasn't too bad. 

There are a couple other things to consider. Sarajevo is in the Balkans. It is super difficult to get around in the Balkans. Forget trains and planes, you're going by bus. Bus to Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro. It's just cheaper and more practical since the train lines are shit and slow. 

Sarajevo is a small city. I'd live there, but I felt stuck there since it was difficult to get anywhere else, especially if you actually hate traveling. If you're going to hunker down there for a while it'd be great. Majestic and the most charming city in Europe, more so than Lviv, which I mentioned earlier.

&gt; To begin with, Greece must exit not only the Eurozone but also the European Union. This is non-negotiable and unavoidable. For if the Greek state is effectively to confiscate the few euros a citizen has in her bank account and turn them into drachmas of diminishing value, she will be able to take the Greek government to the European Courts and win outright. Additionally, the Greek state will have to introduce border and capital controls to prevent the export of its citizens euro-savings. Thus, Greece will have to get out of the European Union.

0,2,Jan_van_Bergen,t5_2ssp3,"The civilian cost came to more than 20,000 deaths as a result of the ensuing famine. Some studies have suggested that the effects were felt for a long period through the health of the Dutch populace, especially of the children of pregnant women who survived the famine. 

Long story short, the Dutch government in exile in London ordered the railway strike to coincide with the airborne landings of Market Garden. The theory was that the Germans would need the railway workers to help move troops around the country to defend against any Allied attacks. About 30,000 railway workers went into hiding, but, unfortunately, the strike was not entirely effective.  The Germans were able to use their own railway stock and workers to transport their troops, decreasing the effect of the Dutch strikers. More importantly, Allied troops were not able to successfully take the bridge at Arnhem, disallowing a crossing of the Lower Rhine (and thereby free access into the North European plain). 

Taking a look at [this map](http://www.mapsofworld.com/netherlands/maps/netherlands-river-map.jpg) will show you that the Netherlands is crossed from East to West by three major rivers. The border between liberated and occupied Netherlands, after the failure of Market Garden, but before the spring 1945 offensive that crossed the Rhine, was between the Waal and Neder Rijn (Lower Rhine) rivers. The city of Nijmegen was liberated in Sept 1944. The city of Dordrecht was in a sort of limbo land between, while the cities of Rotterdam and Arnhem were not liberated until after Allied troops crossed the Rhine at Wesel (just over the German border in the county of Cleves) the next spring. So in the fall of 1944, the southern part of the Netherlands had been liberated, up to the Rhine river, but the northern and eastern part of the country remained under German control. 

After the failure of Market Garden and the coordinated railway strike, the Germans reacted harshly, disallowing all food transports to the West Coast for six weeks, but that was enough to do the damage. The backlog, exacerbated by the damage done to the Dutch railway network in preparation of the invasion and the general shortage in agricultural products combined to create the so-called *Hongerwinter* or Hunger Winter of '44/45. As I stated above, about 20,000 Dutch men and women died as a result of the famine. 

The famine began to be abated in April, when Allied air forces dropped food parcels over the Netherlands (the Germans didn't shoot the down). In late March, Allied troops crossed the Rhine at Wesel, and then proceeded to circle counter-clockwise to liberate the Netherlands from the East. German troops did not surrender until May 5.

Really? Who? Althusser, Foucault, Barthes, Derrida and Baumann would challenge that. Pretty much all of the post-modern crowd would.


And if you refer to PhilPapers study, to someone who argues for objectivity, if you look at the demographics of that study, you will note that certain fields (Philosophy of Mind, Metaphysics, and Normative Ethic) are highly represented while fields of study leaning towards a more post-modern approach such as 20th Century Philosophy, Philosophy of Gender, Race, and Sexuality, and Africana Philsophy are underrepresented. Similarly, the United States is also highly overrepresented.


So, basically, you can argue that in the United States male philosophers mostly in the fields of Philosophy of Mind, Metaphysics, and Normative Ethic agree that there is such a thing as ""objective reality"". Or: Of 931 philosophers 525 lean more towards or accept moral realism over moral anti-realism.


Question now is: Does this really represent the consensus in the philosophical field of morality, as in their writing and predominant theories? Or does it only represent a representative 56% of 931 philosophers interviewed by PhilPapers in 2009?

0,10,Maginotbluestars,t5_2v3da,"There's an issue with NK threatening the world with AM weapons -  when you are the size of NK a few fusion warheads will take you out just as effectively as an Antimatter bomb. And several nations have ICBM's and/or sub launched ones. It does not make them invulnerable.

It would be very interesting how they pulled it off - antimatter is *really* hard to produce with our current technology. Per [Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter_weapon)

&gt;Thus, at the current level of production, an equivalent of a 10 Mt hydrogen bomb, about 250 grams of antimatter will take 2.5 billion years of the energy production of the entire Earth to produce. 

There are a couple of seriously significant non military side effects to having the ability to produce antimatter quickly and cheaply:

Firstly - energy crisis, what energy crisis? Peak oil becomes a mere historical footnote. 

Secondly: the entire solar system and possibly beyond just got opened up. Think journey times in weeks or months instead of years.

Of course there's the minor detail of persuading NK to share - China I suspect has the best chance though the NK regime isn't exactly known for gratitude (when China sent aid trains with food a during a famine, NK *kept the trains* and made the crews walk home). Nevertheless they understand NK and have contacts better than anyone, have proximity, and military might to spare.

Also the Chinese government has a large proportion of engineers - I'd bet they would cotton to the applications quicker than you could say ""New Beijing colony, Cydonia""

As for the rest of the world: crash priority research programmes all round in the US, Europe and Russia - potentially with some cooperation between the first two.

Also, in many other developed countries this kind of spying not only exists, but is in fact completely legal. In the U.K. for example, they have CCTV that monitors nearly every minute of every day of people's activities in public spaces. [France recently approved a sweeping domestic surveillance bill](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/world/europe/french-legislators-approve-sweeping-intelligence-bill.html?_r=0), pretty much of the same scope as the NSA spying in the U.S., with the key distinction that *it is about to be legally codified by their own legislature*. In general, European spy agencies have been [cooperating in similar domestic spying activitiesd](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/11/2/report-europe-spyagenciesworkedtogetheronnsastylemasssurveillanc.html). So the belief that what the U.S did was completely unique is misplaced. The main difference is just the sheer amount of money that the U.S. pumps in to the NSA, and that is mostly just because the US has such a massive economy and a large budget set aside for such programs. 

In general, the U.S. has stronger protections for privacy rights and in particular for due process rights than many European countries. Certainly since 9/11, spy agencies have really pushed the boundaries of what is legal, but that problem isn't really restricted to the U.S. and we have the benefit of Constitutionally enshrined civil protections that don't exist in many other countries.  While it is fair to say a lot of those protections have been eroded at the margins, it is simply wild exaggeration to call the state of affairs totalitarian. We still have strong individual civil rights as citizens that provide us due process and which protect us from the state, and those rights are regularly upheld in the courts despite opposition from the government. That would never happen in a totalitarian state.

0,5,Fresherty,t5_2qkmn,"&gt;Would that be a good idea?

Assuming you're OK with tight schedule and don't really want to relax, yes.

&gt;Which would probably be more worthwhile?

It's not which would be worthwhile, but rather which won't take too much time for it's worth. For example, getting to Zakopane can be absurdly time consuming if it's 'in season' (think 1 km/h type of average speeds due to traffic and accidents). Out those 3, Łódź would be easiest to get to from Warsaw (~1h drive + traffic in city centers), followed by Wrocław (3h drive from Kraków assuming no massive problems at A4 motorway, which is again notoriously congested, or 4 hours from Warsaw).

However, I'd still suggest Zakopane assuming you're not going to go there in full-on tourist season (for example during holidays). Than it's quite simple 1.5-2h drive from Kraków. If not, go for Łódź simply because it's least of a pain in the ass, and actually has surprising amount of stuff to see (despite what many Poles think).

&gt;My family loves driving around so this will probably be a road trip.

Keep in mind Polish driving is... well, let's just say a tad aggressive. I don't know what you're used to, but it's one of the most stressful places to drive through in EU. I won't say ""don't drive"", but really keep it in mind and especially assume the driving will take you longer than you'd probably assume given the distance.

&gt;Also, what's the weather like in Poland in December? How would you guys layer yourselves during that time?

Anything from 10*C and rainy to -20 and freezing. It's really hard to say, Polish climate is quite unpredictable. For obvious reasons weather in mountains will be more harsh, so even though there might not be any snow in - say - Kraków, there might be quite a bit in Zakopane.

Firstly a smaller one from the same trip : I found myself sitting next to a guy on a bus from Arequipa to Cusco in Peru who went out with a friend of mine from Edinburgh (and was doing the usual ""travel after a breakup to get over it"" thing).   

Now, that in itself isn't THAT unusual, given that Edinburgh is the biggest village in the world where everyone seems to have at least one mutual acquaintance.  Plus, it's the Gringo Trail - a LOT of European folk take the exact same route through Peru - Lima -&gt; Arequipa -&gt; Cusco -&gt; Macchu Pichu -&gt; Tacna etc.  I met a trio of Irish girls in Arequipa and bumped into them again in Cusco, for example.

However, there was one that started with a similar coincidence but then went a bit ""bigger"".

Again, Arequipa.  Again, someone from Edinburgh.  In this case it was an Irish girl and an Australian guy on honeymoon.  Turned out they lived about 1/4 mile from where I did and the guy dealt with the rebranding and design of my local pub when it was refurbished a couple of years previously.  

However...the honeymoon was a one way trip.  They had left Edinburgh and were heading to his hometown of Melbourne where they were now going to live.  Their furniture, possessions etc had been shipped ahead.  The woman in question had a job lined up at the maternity hospital in Geelong, Melbourne as she had trained as a midwife.

My dad had left Edinburgh a year or so previously to take up residence with his soon-to-be new wife (my stepmother) in Melbourne.  My stepmum is head of Obstetrics at Geelong.

Entre todas, se preferires uma parte mais científica (virado mais para a investigação, tipo algoritmos), se calhar preferes Ciências da Computação. Se preferes algo mais aplicado, virado para a programação e afins, Eng. Informática é melhor. Obviamente que em CC vais precisar de programar (otherwise...) e em EI vais aprender algoritmos, mas num vais ter mais tendência para uma que outra.

Enter firearms:  I read once that a peasant could be trained to adequately use a napoleon era style musket in about two weeks.  Add in training to march in formation and you are still well under 6 months probably.  When firearms replaced the bow and arrow in Europe you see armies dramatically increase in size.  Theres still a place for nobles among the cavalry, which needs specialized training, but the rank and file are expendable peasants.  Keep in mind the key to early musket warfare is how fast you can load and fire, not how accurate you are.

Take it up with Stalin. Polish suffered enough at the hands of Germans. As of now Germany didn't pay Poland for the destruction during ww2. 

&gt;It sounds like you have a chip on your shoulder about this though and will never be convinced that the mass deportation of an entire race was an awful thing, no matter what had led to it.

I have no chip on my shoulder and I don't have a problem with Germans. I actually had a German gf at some point. What pisses me off are **** like you who come here and cry how poor Germany was after ww2 and you have the flipping nerve to talk about what we owe them. Poland doesn't owe anything to Germans.

The main reason for the trip was so that a girl from Europe and I could reconnect and have a weekend together. Anyways, so I'm in line at the airport waiting to board my flight and I look up and there is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen standing in front of me. An older guy is talking to her but she clearly isn't interested. She looks back at me, smiles, and walks over. At this point I'm like ""Oh jesus to not mess this up"". We chat for a while but she boards the plane before me. As I'm getting on I realize I never got her name. Fast forward and have landed in NY. I get off the plane and wait for her. She gets off the plane and sees me and instantly smiles that perfect smile. I walk over and say ""I can't leave without knowing your name"" She tells me her name. She says she's going to be busy most of the weekend but gives me her number anyways. We text most of the weekend, nothing crazy, just chatting.

Anyways Saturday night rolls around and I'm out with my friends from Europe at this bar called Hair of the Dog. I get a text from plane girl saying ""Hey mr. 1shortof2 hows your night going?"" I say things are good and im out with my friends from Europe. She says that sounds fun then quickly replies ""so, when are you going to ask me what i'm doing tonight?""  I'm thinking oh man she is amazing, so i say ""what are you up to tonight ms plane girl"" she says me and my friends just got to a bar called hair of the dog. 

I turn around and sure enough they are walking through the door. We chatted for a while and she invited me to stay with her. I declined though as I had my girl from Europe with me. Biggest regret so far in life, but the right thing to do. Maybe?

""Your Statement about the UK being representative of the rest of the EU is absolutely false. The firearm death rate has huge swings between member countries of the EU see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate

Based on Statistics from the UK gov on knife crime. In 2011 there were 235 Murders by knife. That is compared to the US’s 1694. When accounting for population variences that brings the UK to 1175 vs the US 1694. HOWEVER, The UK does not report on crimes committed by anyone under the Age of 16 in the national homicide statistics. This is in stark contrast to the US who reports on all Homicides committed in the country. The UK also cannot be applied to the EU as a whole either. Other member countries are vastly more violent or have huge swings in crim. See the UK Gun homicide rate at .25 of 100k population vs France at 3, Germany at 1.2, Austria at 2.9 and Belgium at 2.42. Bring this back to the original argument that the “these type of things don’t happen in other civilized nations” is absolute garbage, they do happen and pretty regularly. I would like to point out that China, Russia and India—if brought into this argument—would lend further credibility to refuting The presidents claim about violence. 

And for good measure; In the US About 40% of guns used in gun crimes are obtained illegally. 37 percent in addition to that 40 are borrowed or obtained from fam or friends. So a whole 77 percent of guns used in crimes are already obtained from a source other than buying them legally. Let's weigh that statistic against the 67.8% of firearm causes of death. That means 51.5% of of 67% is from illegal or more appropriately, non-legal sources. So let's remove that from the statistics ‘cause new laws will not mitigate that crime as it is already against/circumventing the law, so roughly we are left with 16% of gun crime is from legal guns. Now compare that to the FBI statistics and you will see that only 15-16% of all crimes come from legal gun sources. http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2013/05/14/disarming-realities-as-gun-sales-soar-gun-crimes-plummet/

This debunks the notion that banning guns or making them ridiculously hard to get for law abiding citizens will reduce deaths. The vast majority of Gun crime is already committed outside the scope of the law. ""

&gt; In a meeting with a US ambassador-at-large in Tbilisi in November 1996, Shevardnadze told US diplomats that Berezovsky was an ""extraordinary person”, who ""wanted a radically different foreign policy, putting Russia squarely with the West”. ""He merited US support,"" Shevardnadze advised, but ""support would have to be done in the right dosages”. In time, ""he would develop into a necessary and useful man,” Shevardnadze said.

But Berezovsky was actually...

&gt; The only question of wrongdoing discussed in the declassified documents is Berezovsky’s admission that he held Israeli citizenship along with Russian, which was illegal and especially questionable for the deputy head of the security council. ""I did it in 1993 and had totally forgotten about it,"" he told US diplomats somewhat implausibly.  He also claimed to have recently revoked his Israeli citizenship. ""Judging by a phone conversation he had in pol/int chief's presence, he was seeking to have the revocation antedated to precede his appointment to the security council,"" the dispatch commented drily.

Putin was the reaction against all this...

&gt; Berezovsky appears not to have anticipated that Putin would clip the oligarchs’ political wings, perhaps because for him and his fellow oligarchs political and economic power and were one and the same. Putin's ideological mix of capitalism and conservative authoritarianism was new in Russia, which was used to a binary opposition of pro-Soviet statist forces and supporters of pro-Western laissez-fair policies.

Oh yeah and Gusinsky too...

&gt; According to the documents from the Clinton administration, which were released under a mandatory declassification review, one of the chief ideologists of Russia's freshly minted oligarch system was Russian-Israeli banker and media magnate, Vladimir Gusinsky, owner of Most Bank and TV channel NTV.

Technically for something to be a ""conspiracy"" you need some doubt about whether it's true or not.

Where is there a conspiracy?  (it was very openly visible)

What we can say (and has been backed by Putin himself) is that Putin chose to pursue the best interests of Russia **even if it meant confronting the West**.  This makes Putin very dangerous because he's being ""politically incorrect"" on the world stage.

Pretty much. Personally, people like Kosuke Honma really brought the attention of Yahoo! to Japan. A lot of marketing was involved and so far continues down that road.

&gt;Why is marketing in Asian countries cheaper?

Currency plays a pretty big factor in marketing. A lot of marketing is shining light towards Japan after the recession that hit Japan pretty hard last year. Some more details about that [can be found here.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-16/asian-stocks-follow-u-s-shares-higher-as-japan-exits-recession) Investments into the market are slowly but surely getting to Japan now. With how cheap the yen to dollar currency is, there is really no excuse to not play around with the market. Marketers have for a few years realized the fail of megabanks in Japan like the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group(s). Even megabanks in Japan at this point do not know when to seek other countries. Leading for someone who is hungry for money to lead the pack. Labor is another thing that can boost the market too, making for others to dive into the market as well. Asian countries are notorious for cheap labor.

A lot of corporate change is developing now in Japan too. There used to be marketing stigmas about Japan because not that many people understood the culture well enough. Plus, there is a huge difference between Europe and American markets.

So for now, marketing is just a lot cheaper, specifically in countries like Japan. Asia can be an extremely flexible market that is full of risks. Until Japan develops a really straight forward market, I don't expect marketing to get a lot higher. But, I am not a professional. I just tend to read time to time about marketing and then follow up with them in the near future.

Everyone else who lends money knows that Greece is not a safe place to lend your money to any more, so they won't lend money at anything less than extortionate interest rates.

The IMF and the European Central Bank are the only people still prepared to lend money to Greece at rates it could actually hope to repay, money which it needs to pay keep it's head above the water, but they won't do it unless Greece is prepared to restructure how it runs it's self so it stops spending money on things that it cannot afford to pay. If they don't make the changes then they cannot be assured that they are going to get the money back and that greece isn't going to fail anyway. 
The changes they are demanding are to ensure Greece an actually keep operating.

The alternative for Greece is to not meet the demands, and not take the money. Greece is free to do that, but if it does, it WILL continue to default and may have to declare bankruptcy.

If they declare Bankruptcy, nobody will loan to them for a very long time.
Nobody is going to invade them and extract the debt by force. Nobody can force them to pay, but if they cannot pay, nobody will ever lend to them because there's no incentive to do so, since they have a history of not repaying debts.

There are only two options available. Agree to get another bailout loan to pay the debts, or don't pay the debts.

If we just agree that they don't have to pay the debts, it's just the same as them not repaying the debts, because creditors would know that whether through refusal or agreement, Greece did not pay it's debts.

Yes, Greece may be caught between a rock and a hard place, but their government played fast and loose with their economy and lost. They had a retirement age of 50!

You can't just pay for everything with debt. Shit happens eventually. The Greek government let shit happen.

Many people here feel depressed about their life. But I've been smoking weed almost everyday for four years and I don't. Now I feel that I respect weed way more than I did previously. I only use it before going to sleep and ONLY after getting my shit done. 
I graduated last year in the top 10 percentile of my class and during my degree I did two exchanges and three internships in top law firms, and the last one offered me a job after it. I didn't accept it because I got 3 offers for master degrees, two of them abroad, and all of them in really notable and prestigious european faculties.
I don't feel depressed and I have lots of friends, a good family and a good life in general. 
But I keep smoking a joint everyday before going to sleep and deep inside, I know it affects me, not sure how and it's hard to explain, but I believe I would be a better person if I wouldn't do it. But sometimes I also ask myself if I would achieve all the goals I described if I didn't smoke. So I keep wondering if I should stop or not, because I love it, but I know I would be able to give the best of myself if I didn't smoke at all... It's hard to deal with this struggle.

France spread their dynasty to Spain,  ""trigering"" a succession war led by Austria to spread their dynasty instead. France invaded the HRE to keep Bavaria alive as an ally but failed. After that they defended until Austria's candidate as King of Spain became heir to Austria and Austria's most important ally, Great Britain,  peaced out to avoid implementing a personal union between Austria and Spain. France had a low warscore and peaced out by giving Spanish possessions to Austria and promising not to create a personal union with Spain. France's forts held against all of Europe and they were able to get away with only transferring away their ally's territory and subject nations to Austria and giving up a few colonies. This is notable because it was multiplayer and afterwards Spain was mad at France but due to French victories in defensive war they argued successfully that they shouldn't have had to give much up.

We should be able to wage succession wars upon dynasties being spread, probably with a negative diplomatic relations malus against the attacker.

That's not true. There is a difference between default and restructuring debt. De facto they already defaulted. Greece is borrowing at an artificial low rate from the rest of Europe/IMF. They could just extent the maturity and charge low rates. It's politically much more acceptable and that was actually the plan but the Greek leftist went nuts because they didn't wanted the reforms they were asked for that. Even if Greece defaults, they are still a mess and need to reform. And if they leave the Euro, which they probably should, then it will be even more painful in the short term.

0,16,JeromeMorrow13,t5_2xhxs,"I'm going to play devil's advocate here. 

First, it is important to delineate between euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The two are very different, and it's shameful how the ADHD media cycle mixes up the two concepts.

Physician-assisted suicide is practiced in jurisdictions like Oregon and Switzerland. The patient is prescribed a cocktail of powerful barbiturates, usually in an oral suspension. The patient must ingest the fluid, thus ending their lives.

Euthanasia is when the physician administers the lethal medication -- as a Veterinarian would do. This small difference has enormous ramifications regarding the patient/physician relationship. It transforms the doctor into an executioner. The implication of such an arrangement is a discussion for another day.

Now, we'll get back to the topic at hand. Traditionally, a voluntary death under medical supervision requires a multi-step process. A small committee of physicians will review the patient's history and conclude whether the patient is terminal and in what time-frame. If the patient is deemed terminal with a short-time horizon, they will be approved for the procedure. 

Some nations in Europe are relaxing this to include people who are not terminal but who experience tremendous amounts of persistent pain. I fully support physician-assisted suicide but not euthanasia. While I do shit on Libertarians from time to time, it is my belief that a person possesses the right to full autonomy over their lives. 

Pain is subjective. We treat our pets with more compassion than we treat our loved ones. For those, who have not experienced it -- I can assure you, mental anguish can be much worse than physical pain. 

If all interventions have failed her, why should she have to go out and buy a shotgun or take a chance hanging herself, which if botched, can turn you into a vegetable? 

I understand the knee-jerk reaction, and how this can be perceived as degenerative behavior. It unearths a plethora of issues like the possibility of a further relaxation of the regulations.

However, I do not have a problem with this particular case.

I'll end this post with a quote from David Foster Wallace.


*“The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.”*",t1_csp4339,t3_3bs5m6,0,,,,16,False,,1437501799,DarkEnlightenment,False,False,0,1435783232,t3_3bs5m6,csp4339

1) SpaceX is not currently all that much cheaper than Arianespace. It's only getting business cause Proton is doing so very poorly, and providers want at least two (preferably three) launch providers. With Russia temporarily on the defensive, SpaceX has been their only real alternative. The failure of the recent Falcon launch really hurts that position, though. 

2) We don't know how much (if anything) reusability will save. Reusable rockets will likely eventually be cheaper, but in the short term it might cost just as much to refurbish them as it does to build a few rocket. Or not. We just don't know yet. Neither does SpaceX. They certainly *hope* reusability will lower their costs (as do we all!), but they don't know for sure. So saying SpaceX has a ""tech advantage"" may eventually be true... or not. But it certainly isn't true as we write these words. And you can't count on it being true in the near future.

And finally, the most important one of all:

3) Launch costs are only a small portion of the total costs that go along with operating the revenue stream that comes from a satellite. When your total costs go from 1,000 million dollars by launching on Ariane to 980 million launching on Falcon, saving a few million in launch costs isn't a big deal. Getting cheap financing on your 1 billion dollar total expenditure is much more important. Up until now sat operators could get equally cheap funding (more or less) from either the US or Europe... now they won't.

I see many people arguing about the cards and how they should be used everytime they are up.
Cards are one thing you can not argue about, every person has an idea or a goal what they want to reach with their card, do they need damage reduction for the next phase or do they need slight dps boost to finish the last add before it triggers a mechanic, or do they wish to reduce their mp consumption but suddenly they pull Royal Roaded haste card for the raid and decide to hold onto it instead of risking getting the TP reduction card. The cards are random, but containt many useful effects where most of them will be useful, but for me on this solo heal run, I wanted more security than damage, but each approach I have changes based on what cards I get, so do not feel obliged to use your cards in a way someone else defines you need to use them, as the random factor is strong to prevent you to plan before hand what cards you will use in X situation. The hardest mechanic on this fight was fairly at the end, so I had plenty of time to get royal roaded Bole for the main tank.

Overall there is so many points and small things I could shed light into, but honestly there is no need, my whole point was to show this video for those conflicted if they can be viable or not. Due to many questions and arguments and missed points I felt the need to explain in detail what I had in mind while doing my first kill, by no means am I correct in the way I heal. or perfect in the way I play, this is to show what can be done as Astrologian. After this first kill, the way I heal has changed due to having experienced the healing points I need to be aware of. This video is not to present individual skill, it is here presenting the job potential which wasn't even used to it's fullest yet on this first kill compared to how Astrologian can cast instant stoneskins making up the need of having the shield stance on some situations that can prove difficult, but high reflex is required for these kind of play or anticipation.
I am not saying that this job is better than White mage nor Scholar, but what I can say is this job has higher skill cap and understanding required to overcome the situations. Instead of having the strong emergency heals, you have the tools to build an escape route on scenarios that can be out of your healing range, I am not referring to cards only, but holding onto instant benefics and other synastry like tools you are able to use. I encourage people to leave the comfort zone and keybind all the skills and maximize the mobility heals/reaction based heals this job can offer.

I hope this shed light to people who wished to know more or for people who misunderstood actions happening in the video or to fellow Astrologians who had doubts about this job. No information has been released on Alexander so any argument about Astrologian being not viable is invalid, we all have to wait to see what is coming, the more movement is involved, the stronger Astrologian becomes.

That's it for me, I will be busy for the next coming days preparing for Alexander and finishing in game related things, I take this time to thank everyone who engaged in a discussion here and I wish you all enjoyable moments for raiding and progression. There is always a way to do things the way you enjoy it.

The clothes these girls wear today would have had German headmasters beating them with a cane 70 years ago. I certainly wouldn't want a female familymember of mine dressing in miniskirts and stomach revealing shirts **in the 7th grade**.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Also, this ""Syrian Muslims"" thing is nonsense. These aren't religious people or they'd join the IS. The *niqab*, which is the ninja ghost looking suit, is banned in Syrian public establishments like universities. In fact, women in Syria don't even have to wear the hijab (the silk veil over the hair). [Not even the First Lady of Syria wears any head covering](http://i.imgur.com/fnbhgBZ.jpg).  
&amp;nbsp;  

These Syrian asylum seekers aren't coming from Saudi Arabia, they're from a modern secular state where there is no Sharia law except in places where people can't get out, like IS controlled areas.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Anti-Muslim (rather than anti-immigration) = extremely pro-jewish. I've yet to see a single example to the contrary. Don't mix their misleading garbage up with white politics. The issue here is that Arabs and blacks correctly gauge that white men are weak and pathetic, and that they can fuck our women because we're submissive liberal pussies, not any fucking Sharia law bullshit. Pudgy middle aged conservatives coming out at PEGIDA demonstrations demanding their middle school aged daughters be allowed to wear mini-skirts in class because of ""Sharia law"" only cements this perception they have of us.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Not only because it's the wrong angle to take, but especially because it's loaded with glaring errors like pretending most muslims in Europe want to have their cheap vodka, porn movies, nigger clothes, and marijuana taken away by re-establishing medieval Islamic law.  
&amp;nbsp;  

These Syrians aren't thinking about their religion, if they were they would stay home and fight for it. What want to see is these women dressed like sluts, and they want to use the stipend provided by the German taxpayer to see if they can get blonde pussy at the local night club. They really are that simple.

Russia was pissed off because Ukraine wasn't dumb enough to join their little Euroasian soviet union project. So they decided to destroy Ukraine.

Russia saw an opportunity to grab some land and exploited the situation.

Russia needed a warm water port for their warmongering army so they just took Crimea.

Russians always negated the existance of Ukraine as a nation. And always behaved like Ukraine is a part of Russia. So this invasion is nothing new. Russia was attacking Ukraine long before this war.

How much time, on the average, do you spend maintaining those plates, including getting them, maintaining game, and so on? Because unless you are overflowing with money and have a chiseled body with a tan and a European accent, you still have to put in effort in to getting plates - going out, text game, arranging meetups and so on. 

Now consider that some guys, between all the self improvement shit that they are doing, simply don't have the time or energy to do this. Try working in a demanding career with 60 hour weeks (which is usually the high paying ones), but still wanting to do personal hobbies, as well as gym, and you will find that your free time to go out and work on plates is limited. 

In this case, having an LTR is often the preferred option, as you don't have to go out of your way to keep getting sex. 

Also, LTRs do not imply a track to marriage. Nobody is saying you have to sign papers or move in with the girl and split rent, or share finances in an LTR in preparation. LTRS are simply a transnational exchange of you not going for other girls in return of you getting sex and other benefits without putting in much effort.

I can't even find a connection between Isis and domestic mass shootings except that they make excellent distractions for mass media to feed the general population. Honestly it seems like you're taking these past events and forcing them to fit in with your theories. Its like coming up with a theory and then forcing evidence to conform with that theory. Sure, maybe some sketchy shit happened with the authorities handling of the aurora shooting. Most likely because the police forces have a habit of fucking up hard, and would rather keep quite and let people think what they want rather than admit they are horrible at their jobs. And that Oates dude refusing t answer certain questions? What's more likely, him covering his own ass/superiors ass or some conspiracy .

And the ISIS thing? Really? The fact that you think is even remotely possible is idiotic and illustrates a basic understanding of the group in general. Not granted there could be some isolated, incidents that amount to fuck all but Isis could care less about us for a number of reasons.

1st  being ISIS is "" jihad oriented terrorist group"" in the loosest sense of the term. Unlike normal groups like al Qaeda who are nationalist jihad bdohps ISIS is world wide. Which is just crazy delusional but have enough funding to buy into it. And this funding comes from the oil pipelines they jacked and unload in Turkey for transport. They also receive massive funding from the Saudi's who are strongly linked financially to America.

 2nd Isis doesn't not give a fuck about Israel , least not like  al Qaeda who was about us/Israel thing. Isis cares way more about the European imperialism in the 18tg/19 century and then being treated as subhumans when they were allowed to immigrant to the very countries that fucked them. So they decided to take advantage of the repulsive state of affairs Iraq was left it and start their own terrorist stats. Which works for the major world powers as everyone is more or less waiting to see what happens when Putin dies. All this to say conspiracies are almost always nonsense. Shit happens , and there are always amoral opportunistic asshole that take advantage.

You have to wonder what the Lib Dem membership truly values to be so swept away by Clegg and to then feel so betrayed.

It's the same sorry story as with Labour: A party that became an institutional party to acquire political power and **forsake** it's roots and ideology: No wonder a light gust left the party uprooted so easily so recently.

The Liberal Democrat Party is much like The Laughing Cavalier: He is neither laughing not a Cavalier!

But perhaps I can learn from you: What attracted you to the Lib Dems? How did their ideology match your own values and when you voted for them did you do it based on that alone or according to a concession to the political power matrix of parties and coalitions?

The extreme difficulty I have with the Lib Dems is a party with that name could not possibly vote for the EU if they really upheld Liberalism and Democracy. With their move to the Center as LibLabCon leaving the edges and regions as well as losing any perception all difference as ""the third party option""; their doom was written as Hannan says elsewhere; in the 80's... .

0,0,theyeatthepoo,t5_31ykc,"The IMF has loaned Greece £32 billion and the rest of Greece's loans from Europe totals more than £320 billion. The interest on that is higher than the total of £32 billion loaned by the IMF.

In addition it is worth noting that the IMF has made £2.5 billion in profit from the Greek crises. So even with the default yesterday it has made a profit of £900 million on an effect interest rate of more than 3%. 

&gt;Rightly so. Why should other countries, who were also suffering the effects of the recession, give money to Greece to allow them to continue being wasteful? It would be madness to loan them the money and not ask for some actions on Greece's part to assure you they would be good for the repayments.

Greece has been asked to go ahead with the action you talk about for more than 5 years. We can see the results now. The results are that we have to keep giving them money because there economy has not recovered due to austerity. 

According to documents drawn up by the troika even if Greece signs up to the full package of tax and spending reforms demanded of it  *'the country would face a level of debt that the IMF deems unsustainable'* and that *'Greece needs substantial debt relief for a lasting economic recovery'.*

That is the IMF saying that. Even the IMF disagrees with you. 

We need to give Greece money to invest in its economy so that it's economy can recover. If we continue to ask Greece to cut and squeeze the poorest then its economy will not grow. That has already been shown by the last 5 years. 

&gt;This demonstrates a complete lack of economic knowledge. Thank Christ you aren't the Chancellor. The reason they got into trouble was they had an imbalanced economy and were massively in debt, so when the recession hit, they were completely unable to respond adequately and were ruined by it. The Eurozone didn't force them to act irresponsibly, the Greek governments piggybacked on the stronger countries to get into so much debt in the first place. If anyone has a duty it's Greece. They need to pull their fingers out and stop damaging the rest of the Eurozone due to their incompetence.

Japan has a debt to GDP ratio of almost 200% and the cost of its debt has not grown. The reason it became a problem for Greece was because of its place in the EU.  At the time of the Crash Greece's debt to GDP ratio was around 90-100% (after 7 years of Austerity its not 160%). The reason that became a problem was because the economy crashed and even then they could have avoided disaster had they put money back into an economy in which private credit was drying up. Instead they where forced by the IMF et all to cut back spending further and now we see the result of that.

If Greece had been able to use quantitative easing to release credit into the economy then it would not have suffered but as it didn't have the normal monetary tools it its disposal the debt became a problem. This is why the ECB owes it to Greece to lend it at hand.

Also remember that Greece was one part of a wider European economy. It was a huge importer. That's what drove its economic growth before the economic crash. Who do you think was doing the exporting? Overwhelming its was Germany, and Germany's economy grew on the back of it. 

Remember that. The Greek economy was part of a wider European and Global economy. 

&gt;The Greek government caused the economy to be ruined the way it was. The Greek people voted for that, and they continue to vote for charlatan parties like Syriza. They made their bed and now they have to lie in it.

The Greek people didn't vote for Fraud, the didn't vote for what happened in their **PRIVATE** banking sectormand they didn't vote for the sub-prime mortgage crisis in Florida.

In fact until the 1970s, if US parents wanted to subject a daughter to clitoridectomy (i.e., female genital mutilation), it was only a matter of finding a willing doctor. Here is one woman's story of her [US medical female genital mutilation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx3nGs7mQug) (13 min). Involuntary clitoridectomy like this grew unpopular by the 1980s but it was not criminalized until 1996. And (legal) voluntary adult female genital cutting, a popular trend in the 1970s, was not rebuked by any US medical organization until 2007 ([Rodriguez, 2014](http://books.google.com/books?id=-PMwBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;pg=PA124)). 

In 2010, the AAP actually recommended taking a step backwards in the fight against female genital cutting by recommending doctors perform non-excisive female genital cutting in order to placate parents who would prefer riskier and more severe surgeries. Their suggestion was quickly retracted due to massive criticism, but it shows how US medical authorities would prefer to lead the world toward medicalizing genital cutting for both sexes. By contrast, European doctors discourage nontherapeutic/cultural genital cutting for both sexes.

0,18,TheLARPKing,t5_2qwis,"This may just be my opinion, but I do believe the consensus was that the updates done to the game were very minimal. I'll post the change-log at the bottom but to summarize:
&amp;nbsp;

The Fixes and Additions:  
&amp;nbsp;

Stealth:
&amp;nbsp;

  Stealth was a stat and movement option in the game but it had no effect on the reaction of the enemy, it just made your character crouch and increased the action points required for moving. As soon as you attacked you drew the attention of the entire map and all hostile NPCs B-lined it towards your characters. 
&amp;nbsp;
  Supposedly this was changed so that there is now a radius depending on your stealth stat around your character so that this does not happen, however I did not notice any change on my play through after it was ""fixed"". They did add an icon to show if a unit was ""stealthed""

&amp;nbsp;

Shop Interface:
&amp;nbsp;

  In previous Jagged Alliance games, your main interface was a retro laptop, where you hired your goons and bought your arsenal through websites on your laptop. Your purchases would be shipped to an airport of your choosing within a few days in-game time, and you would have to recover them there. 
&amp;nbsp;

  In Flashback, there were 3 or 4 NPC vendors in the major town sectors that would sell you guns through the text based conversation system. Essentially you only had the option to buy items, you picked categories of weapons, and were given 4 options per page plus a 5th ""Next Page"" option.  And you cycled through pages without seeing the stats for any of the guns and armor you were buying. 
&amp;nbsp;

  After the community complained heavily about this, they created a shop interface that would open up and you could buy what you wanted from there. It was definitely better then it was initially, but it was still clunky, minimal and in my opinion hastily thrown together. I could not find a picture of it for reference though.

&amp;nbsp;

Weapon Attachments and Ammo Types:
&amp;nbsp;

  Gun Porn was a huge part of Jagged Alliance 2, even more so with some of the mods created for it. Each gun had various types of mounts or slots where you could add attachments like scopes and laser sights for accuracy, folding stocks, straps and hair triggers for speed to reduce the action point cost for aiming, and many more. 
&amp;nbsp;

Flashback had none of that. You got the gun and could not customize it period.
&amp;nbsp;

This was one of the major complaints about the game, and eventually they added the ability to attach one mod to some of the guns. it was better then nothing but still felt like they only added it because they felt they were being forced to. 
&amp;nbsp;

  In previous games there were several different ammo types for each caliber, (hollow point, FMJ, etc, even tracer rounds), as well as various types of grenades and rockets (tear gas, mustard gas, stun, high explosive and fragmentation), you could also get satchel charges, and landmines.  All of these different tools were used for different situations and it was a huge part of the overall tactical element. 
&amp;nbsp;

  Flashback had none of this either, not until the complaints begged for it. They eventually added hollow point and armor piercing rounds, but I believe the only explosive is still a non-descriptive hand grenade. 

&amp;nbsp;

Finally the ""Free DLC"" (as it was called)
&amp;nbsp;

Lighthouse Sector
&amp;nbsp;
This was perhaps the most offensive change. 
&amp;nbsp;
There was a lighthouse sector (called an outpost) already in the game, however capturing it had no effect on gameplay. Usually when you captured a town or a mine, you would get an increase of your daily income or greater sight radius on the world map.  
&amp;nbsp;
They added a few more of these sectors, gave them a small daily income and removed the cost to deploy units in adjacent sectors. I honestly did not explore each of these sectors because I felt they were a minor change of no value which no one asked for, and above all it was too little, too late. 
&amp;nbsp;

They also added a couple of Soviet era weapons.

This is a copy of the change-log for anyone curious. You can see that there were only a handful of updates, many of the changes were things promised in the initial kickstarter campaign. Some things are as basic as several European language translations. Also worth noting that this was a European game.
&amp;nbsp;

Basically the changes they made to the game were certainly better then nothing, were minimal, very low effort, and in my opinion just damage control. 

&amp;nbsp;

I hope this answers your question, I'm sorry if it doesn't!

Further, ""Why doesn'teveryone do this and fix their economies?""
Well, because of the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, they sort of...can't. Imposed upon the European Union were policies that ended Greece's ability to snap back from a harsh recession, and it shows in the negative returns on bonds in Germany, the poor inflation and growth in France and England, the rise of psuedo-nationalist political groups, and a general economic malaise across the entire European Union. The fact is, they -can- do this, but where the US has the Federal Reserve, the EU has the European Central Bank, and -they- call the shots over there.
What was wrong with Japan is that they were in a deflationary spiral. This resulting in business closures, unemployment, weirdly irrational prices for even consumption goods and services, and loss of export business via the Chinese. Due to a shortfall of aggregate demand, investments were no longer made. Businesses and would-be entrepreneurs saved their money instead of investing said money, and nobody borrowed, because the price of debt rose over time, as opposed to being devalued mostly by inflation. This caused a disincentive to borrow, a disincentive to lend, meaning few businesses expanded to hire more, forcing them to make due with the pool of workers they had, halting growth, and leading to stagnation, which further forced more work onto the Japanese people, further lowered aggregate demand as fewer were actually working... 20 years ago, they had an aging population that was going to be good for a little while. Now? Not so much. Quantitative easing, it's important to note, is the absolute last stand we have against long-term depression. If the Federal Reserve did not enact these policies, or if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too soon, we could just as easily slip backward and wind up at the end of the line. As it is, an entire generation is going to lose half of what they otherwise would've earned because of terrible economic policy that caused the crash, during the crash, before the Federal Reserve acted, after the Federal Reserve acted, and even today. 
You cannot save your way out of a recession once you're already in it. However, when you're -not- in a recession, THAT is when you save. Unfortunately, instead of saving during the good times, we ended up lowering taxes and going to war, increasing spending across the board, and banking on some fool's gold of a plan (that tax breaks encourage growth, or worse, that cutting taxes increases tax revenue) to make up for it. This left us categorically ill-positioned to deal with the aftermath of a deregulation-caused housing disaster.

0,4,Doctanasty,t5_2zume,"**Overview**

This match is a BO1 with a map that will be determined by a series of vetoes prior to the game. I predict Cache or Train to be the chose map. 

**Head to Head**

Unfortunately for these teams, one of the rare EU vs. NA matches they get to play will be against an opponent they just faced a week ago. Fortunately for us, this means we can see how they matched up. If you guys have forgot, these are the results of the teams' previous matchups (including their last one): 

- [1] Cloud 9 vs. EnV [2] (19-16, 2-16, 12-16)
- [0] Cloud 9 vs. EnV [2] (5-16, 10-16)
- [0] Cloud 9 vs. EnV [2] (8-16, 10-16)

- Map W/L: 6/1 EnV (85%)
- Round Differential: +40 EnV

Obviously Cloud 9 was able to figure something out (Other than that Inferno map, but they did start T) in their last meeting, as being able to snag a map as well as make the third map close is pretty solid for a NA vs EU matchup. 

What is most note-worthy to me of last weekend's match, was how awfully Freakazoid was playing, yet C9 still made it really close. I honestly don't see any plausible way that he can NOT learn from that match and pick it up a tiny bit, which could put Cloud 9 in a position to win the map. 

-------------------------
**Cloud 9**

Like I said last weekend, this is a hard game to compare the teams because of the difference in competition. Cloud 9 hasn't even played since that LAN, most likely to focus on preparing for this tournament, as the prize pool is quite juicy. Their last 5 matches are: 

- [0] Cloud 9 vs. Virtus Pro [2] (13-16, 5-16)
- [1] Cloud 9 vs. EnV [2] (19-16, 2-16, 12-16)
- [2] Cloud 9 vs. Lunatik [0] (16-10, 16-11)
- [1] Cloud 9 vs. TempoStorm [0] (16-11)
- [0] Cloud 9 vs. Liquid [2] (13-16, 4-16)

- Map W/L: 4/6 (40%)
- Round Differential: -28

Obviously the losses against the EU teams were expected odds-wise... but I was hoping for a bit more in the VP game. The Lunatik game was the definition of trolling and can't really be considered as evidence of good or bad gameplay. Liquid was pretty hot when they beat Cloud 9, and recent matches have shown that they really like to back and forth with each other. Either way, none of these NA teams are comparable to EU competition... so whatever. 

The main factor with C9 right now is simply Freak. If he plays decently against this team (and again, he can't do worse), then I think Cloud 9 have a legitimate chance. 

--------------------------
**EnV**

EnV has proven to be lackluster team in their first LAN maps of the day, as shown by their 1-3 record in the last 2 LAN's in such maps. They were 0-3 and finally broke the streak against Mouz, which was only a +3 point victory. They really turned on the gas against NiP in the finals of Gfinity Summer 1, smoking through a quick 3 maps in a BO5. Their online matches since then have been solid, only barely dropping to fnatic in OT and TSM by 3, the rest ending in wins. 

Don't think it was enough for them to qualify for the FaceIt LAN, but I might be mistaken. Anyway, here is their last 5 games: 

- [1] EnV vs. FlipSid3 [0] (16-11)
- [1] EnV vs. Na'VI [0] (16-9)
- [0] EnV vs. fnatic [1] (19-21)
- [1] EnV vs. Titan [0] (16-14)
- [1] EnV vs. FlipSid3 [0] (16-12)

- Map W/L: 4/1 (80%)
- Round Differential: +18

Again, all of these are online, which can arguably be separated from predicting LAN matches, but what it does show that EnV is performing against teams that I would put decently ahead of Cloud 9. 

If Cloud 9 wants to steal a game, this is the one. They were able to beat EnV on the first map last weekend, and EnV dropped to a similar team in Gplay and FlipSid3 in early morning BO1's in the StarSeries. I would put this one as the most probable EU vs NA upset (not really doesn't have much competition, though) for day one.

0,2,lesserstuff,t5_30hhs,"Keep in mind Yatsenyuk and Tyrchinov were not trusted, and the speech is just promises with no judicial base.

So the main point is that he together with President Turchynov will not pass the suggestion of removal of the [2012 law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language_in_Ukraine#Russian_language_in_Ukrainian_politics) which made Russian a ""regional language"" which passed the parliament (the removal of the law passed the parliament). He says this will keep Russian as de facto official in relevant regions. And there will not be any removal of rights for Russian speakers. This is more damage control than an offer, it wasn't more than status-quo. The people got really angry when the [first thing](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26312008) the interim government did was to vote through the limitations of the rights of the Russian language as well as clearing the parliament of the opposition. And with presidential election coming this promise wasn't very solid. The demand was to make Russian co-official language. 

He also talks about decentralization, how it will allow questions of history and culture be decided on regional level and control of finances. This will be in a new constitution. The problem with this is they never went through with it. [One month](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/ukraine-to-adopt-laws-on-decentralization-of-power-within-three-months-343388.html) after the speech (a bit late) they gave the order to make a draft about decentralization to be complete within three months. 

[One month](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-agrees-to-decentralization-talks-but-without-insurgents-1.2642274) later they are against decentralization and have to be coerced by the EU and OSCE. But they gave no indication of being interested in decentralization anyway: ""Even as Yatsenyuk launched the talks he was dismissive of them, thanking the OSCE for its efforts but saying Ukraine has its own plan to end the crisis. He gave no details of that plan"". Kiev also demanded that the separatist not attend the talks.

The reason for not wanting to talk to the separatists is [possibly](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/05/ukraine-agrees-decentralisation-talks-201451413613392256.html): ""Opening the talks [with OSCE about decentralization] on Wednesday, Turchynov said, ""Those with weapons in hand who are waging a war against their own country and dictating the will of a neighboring country will answer before the law. We will not yield to blackmail."" So they seem to acknowledge that these are citizens of Ukraine but they don't like that they have occupied government buildings (btw this happened in western Ukraine before Yanukovych stepped down, they stole at least anti tank guns and BTR, also happened in Kiev). ""....Dictating the will of a neighboring country"" seems like they now blame Russia for separatists demand for decentralization which might be why they ignored OSCE and started their own plan. Here they already completely ignore the speech and the previous order for a draft.

Lets say the request to not talk to the separatists is valid. They still were against an EU and OSCE plan of decentralization (which EU still supports and have given Ukraine money for). And I guess didn't want the support of the Donbass and south-east population who were for decentralization, aka the people he addressed in his speech.

Finally on April 6th 2015 more than one year after Yatsenyuk nice speech. Poroshenko is now president and he lifts [his objections to a referendum that could give more powers to the regions](http://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-leader-lifts-objections-vote-regional-power-094037913.html). Now they have gone from decentralization draft within three months to ""I'm ready to launch a referendum on the issue of state governance if you [parliamentary commission] decide it is necessary, he said"". Again separatists are not invited. 

Today the only thing that has forced the issue of decentralization is the Minsk agreements. And you could argue that these where forced upon the government because the agreements where signed after big defeats of the Ukrainian army (signed after defeat at Amvrosiivka and encirclement of Debaltseve), together with EU pressure. 

You could also argue that they didn't go on with the decentralization in 2014 because the separatists started and escalated an armed conflict. But this makes Ukraine forget about the civilians of Donbass, who according to the government where occupied against their wishes. This also gives the current decentralization effort a weird angle. When now even more Ukrainian soldiers have died who fought against this and the region is less likely to return to Ukrainian control. If the government didn't want it when the armed hostilities started why would they want it now etc.

There also talk of other stuff. Like they won't allow any illegal armed groups (on Ukraine's side) and that anyone who wants to defend Ukraine should join the army. Today there are still illegal armed groups fighting for Ukraine, for example OUN. 

They say east shouldn't fear any ""banderovtsi"", (the fear was that [these guys ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fKIq8fE1CE) would come to the east and do the same thing that they did in Kiev).
[They](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/in-kharkiv-ukraines-biggest-pro-russian-city-a-question-of-who-is-in-charge/2014/02/27/8baca598-9fd2-11e3-a050-dc3322a94fa7_story.html) came and the government didn't try to stop it.

I have to inform you that most of the pro-EU center-right of Greece right now are convinced that SYRIZA has a plan to secede from the EU. They believe it has created an elaborate plan to bring us to this horrible point so that we will hate foreigners and willingly say no to the EU. 

I will not claim I consider it 100% certain. However, I will say that I can not discount it.

Why? Because there are indications it might be true. The SYRIZA party has purely Communist factions. Look up the MPs Lafazanis and Lapavitsas for example, they have a purely Communist background or/and they are anti-Euro and anti-EU. Even Tsipras has a purely Communist background.

I believe there is a real chance this planning might be true making them really dangerous if it unfolds.

Furthermore various of their moves the past few days indicate towards that. The most blatant one is that they waited for the very last moment to call the referendum. They now attack foreigners for closing the banks. However, the banks had to close anyway because 5 Parliaments would have to ratify an extension of the old program for that to not happen [there was no time at all, there were only 4-5 hours left to find the 5 approvals, something ridiculously impossible]. Did they not know that? Of course they did. Why did they do the referendum at the very last moment and not a week before? I can't see another explanation, it is planned, by SYRIZA. The banks close and blame the 'bad foreigners'.

This goes hand-in-hand perfectly with the blatant loaded question of that ridiculous referendum question. Notice that it doesn't ask the people to accept the SYRIZA proposal which was approximately equally harsh, it only asks ""do you want the proposal of those foreigners?"". It seems it was all a ploy to instill negativity towards the 'no' that they want. Even the KKE party exposed them for that hypocrisy with the use of that loaded question, and at a referendum at that.

Again, I do not discount it's just megalomania and incompetence but there is also a good chance of a plan. Or a combination.

1.) The issue isn't about, ""Turks"", but Muslims in former Ottoman lands (Arab world excluded). Most of the Muslims cleansed from the Balkans/Russia weren't Turks, but local ""Europeans"" whose families had converted to Islam hundreds of years ago. 

2.) Most of the ethnic Turks that did live in the Balkans had been doing so for hundreds of years. Claiming that they deserved to be ethnically cleansed because their ancestors were invaders hundreds of years ago is nonsensical, and if applied consistently, would justify the destruction of most countries around the world. 

3.) Everything roughly east of Ukraine was basically native Turkic-Muslim land for hundreds of years before the expansion of Russia, and mass ethnic-cleansing that followed.

4.) The Balkans were in shit before the Ottomans. If it weren't the Turks that subjugated them, it would have been Russians/Europeans. The, ""backward"" label is also rich, considering much of the Muslim world was more, ""modern"" than Europe until the 18th century.

This goes hand-in-hand perfectly with the blatant loaded question of that ridiculous referendum question. Notice that it doesn't ask the people to accept the SYRIZA proposal which was approximately equally harsh, it only asks ""do you want the proposal of those foreigners?"". It seems it was all a ploy to instill negativity towards the 'no' that they want. Even the KKE party exposed them for that hypocrisy with the use of that loaded question, and at a referendum at that.

Again, I do not discount it's just megalomania and incompetence but there is also a good chance of a plan. Or a combination.

Non touristy places are interesting, but also depressing. 

Eventually many cities look all the same, because they share the same history: small village not long ago, then massive construction in the 20th century. The same old 6 story residential blocks built 30 years ago, the same 25 story apartment towers built 15 years ago, the same ramshackle buildings of the old days which will soon be demolished, and which are not even worth saving from a European's perspective. Don't expect any European style ""old towns"" in most places. And even if there are ""old towns"" the concept of preservation is often not well understood - i.e. it's not ""leave things original"" but rather ""use modern means to make things look like they once did"", like the rebuilt sections of the Great Wall, which aren't really very old.

Anyway, non-touristy places: Taiyuan - the capital of dust. Any city between Xiamen and the tulous - welcome to the home of depressing factory towns in the middle of nowhere. Anywhere around Pudong airport. Wuzhen, outside the water town area - guaranteed free from tourists, who'd want to be there if you could be inside?

S ovom brojkom sam se prvi put sreo na nekom grafikonu Radija Slobodna Europa još prošle godine ali oni za BiH, za razliku od ostalih europskih zemalja, nisu bili naveli svoje izvore. Često sam nailazio na razne engleske članke na /r/SyrianCivilWar, /r/Europe i sl. koji također spominju cifru od 300 i jednako često sam tražio izvore te famozne i zaista zabrinjavajuće brojke ali evo do dan danas nisam ih našao. Može li mi neko ovdje pomoći naći jedan tekst na bosanskom jeziku u kojem bilo koji domaći organi spominju baš ovu cifru?

Evo recimo sad odradim jednostavnu pretragu na [Googletu](https://www.google.ba/search?site=&amp;source=hp&amp;q=državljana+siriji+site%3Aba) i prvi rezultat je [od prije 3 mjeseca](http://www.avaz.ba/clanak/170970/sipa-u-siriji-ratuje-80-bh-drzavljana?url=clanak/170970/sipa-u-siriji-ratuje-80-bh-drzavljana)

&gt;Agencija (SIPA) raspolaže saznanjima da trenutno **između 70 i 80** bh. državljana učestvuje u oružanim sukobima na tom ratištu.

U septembru prošle godine na Federalnoj TV i brojnim elektronskim medijima su išle [ove slike vehabija](http://www.klix.ba/vijesti/bih/ovo-su-drzavljani-bih-koji-su-ratovali-ili-se-jos-uvijek-bore-u-siriji-i-iraku/140904017) koji su ratovali ili još ratuju u Siriji i Iraku i tu se spominjala brojka od **oko 150.**

Jedini članci koji spominju 300 boraca su oni koji citiraju neku američku organizaciju i to

&gt;Posljednje poluslužbene informacije govore da je na ratišta u Siriji otišlo više od **140** bh. državljana, **ali se špekuliše** s puno većom brojkom od navedene. **Procjene** stručnjaka Analitičari iz područja terorizma koji su okupljeni oko organizacije “Terroism Research, and analysis consurtium” (TRAC) procjenjuju kako je iz BiH u Siriju i Irak otišlo više od **300** islamista.

As I said, still not sufficient time for Badawi.

&gt; As for it being posted late, shit gets posted late all the time. You post it when it's ready in times like this where every new development will inevitably be seen by everyone. 

Was it really ready? Certainly looked like a rushed job to me. Some owners couldn't even talk to each so as to corroborate each others stories. 

Example:


Gravity owner

&gt; Additionally, he contacted Altec while under contract with Winterfox to scrim with an early iteration of Misfits. He never explicitly asked Altec to join, but just to scrim. I believe that this was an attempt to poach him if he agreed to start scrimming with him.

Wfx owner doesn't even talk **about his own player getting poached according to GV owner**. Wtf?

The closest he comes is 

&gt; I was notified that Badawi was looking to form his own team and that he was potentially interested in buying out the contract of one of my players. After some email exchanges, we decided mutually that the trade wasn't in either of our best interest.

Probably referring to altec. So what's up with this altec 'attempt at poaching'?

Did Travis just not ask him? What's going on? My conclusion is that the altec 'attempt at poaching' is not true at all. Or that it was rushed to the point theu couldn't corroborate each other. 


&gt; Not only that, but why would it matter if NA is asleep? Is EU as a region sided against Badawi and I'm just not aware? Is EU the biggest supporter of NA team management?

Really don't know where you're getting that from. The point is that it's posted at a poor time where the people it can affect the most aren't able to see it. Why was there this rush to post it at a poor time? Sites want as many people to see the story as possible and the time that these were released weren't great for either region. Generally big stories like this get posted either much earlier so na can see it in the afternoon and eu a little before 'bed time' or much later in the day when eu wakes up.

That's what Tsipras is saying.... that doesn't mean it's credible. He's been offered a deal, he recommends that the Greek people reject it and despite promising no referendum he's called a referendum and encouraged them to reject it.

Nobody in their right mind would negotiate with him any more now. He's always been 4 months late on what he needs to say. If you read/listen to his most recent speech it's quite clear he's now just lying.

0,4,Shiftab,t5_2qkli,"&gt;Would you accept this is no way to measure poverty?

No, It's only *not* a measure of poverty if you define poverty purely in terms of access to physical means but that's usually defined as destitution. Poverty is usually used to describe the more social aspect of being 'poor', It's more about how effectively a person can integrate with the rest of society.

This is what Adam Smith said about poverty:

&gt;By necessaries I understand not only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the lowest order, to be without. A linen shirt, for example, is, strictly speaking, not a necessary of life. The Greeks and Romans lived, I suppose, very comfortably though they had no linen. But in the present times, through the greater part of Europe, a creditable day-labourer would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt, the want of which would be supposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty which, it is presumed, nobody can well fall into without extreme bad conduct. Custom, in the same manner, has rendered leather shoes a necessary of life in England.

The massive problem I have with this however is that it's an *international* scale. It's not like we were using some out dated measurement. We're just crap at it. According to UNICEF there's 10 countries who's poverty rating is *half* ours. Even in *destitution* we're ranked someplace around 10th out of the 32 most developed nations.

The crazy thing is that relative poverty is probably actually working in the Tories *favor*. Wages have remained stagnate for a long time now but cost of living, especially rent, has skyrocketed. This means it's entirely possible that a person who was defined as in poverty just a few decades ago was actually much better off in relative terms than a person defined as in poverty now. This is because right now a much higher percentage of their income goes on rent but the same amount of people will be below that 60% line because wages haven't changed.

As far as the argument that there'll be more child poverty because the wages are lower in scotland goes. Well yeh, do you not think that this is a *problem*? This only would happen if the wages are so low that a significant proportion of them falls below 60% of the *median* wage. That's very bad. The bottom 60% of wages, sure i'd agree with you but not 60% of the wage that is at the median. We should be aiming to have wages in the UK be *closer* not redefining our definition of 'poor' so that we don't have to worry about it, don't you think?",t1_cspihw9,t3_3btol8,0,,putting the cool in shcool,,4,False,,1437514061,Scotland,False,False,0,1435809288,t1_cspfk07,cspihw9

For military history, I would recommend Shadows in the Desert, by Kaveh Farrokh:

http://www.amazon.com/Shadows-Desert-Ancient-General-Military/dp/1846031087

Whilst he does utilize ancient Greek Sources, he also makes it a point of referring to archaeological and pictorial evidence from Persia itself, such as the surviving bas-reliefs as Persepolis. He is also fairly balanced in that he objectively describes both the strengths and weaknesses of the Achaemenid army, especially in regards to Greece. Whilst he does advocate the idea that Indo-Europeans originated in the middle-east (which has been disproven with the confirmation that the Yamna Culture as the source of the original migration, I believe), in all other areas he is quite accurate.

Another book in relation to Persian military history is the Achaemenid Persian Army, by Duncan Head. It was published by Montvert, a company that is now out of business, so there are no copyright issues from reading it online here:

http://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Persia-Concise-History-Achaemenid/dp/0521253691/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435809619&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Achaemenid+Empire&amp;pebp=1435809624170&amp;perid=1RHRG4ZDSMKK1K15G52T

I similarly have that book and I can assure you it is incredibly informative and very well written, and makes use of a wide range of primary courses from the Iraq/Iran region rather than just relying on Greek authors.",t1_cspioqs,t3_3btynd,0,europe,Ancient and Medieval Warfare | Byzantine History,,3,False,,1437514210,AskHistorians,False,False,0,1435809687,t3_3btynd,cspioqs

The period of 2011-2012 was a time when Australia's Economy was very good, while the US Economy was still recovering from the GFC in 2008. The AUD strength was every bit due to the US not being strong, Europe having trouble recovering, coupled with the last remains of the Mining Boom for Australia, and China buying Australia's resourced to keep their economy running. 

That, coupled with Australia avoiding recession during the GFC made the AUD a ""haven"" for investors to make money. So they put their investments in the AUD, and it rose. 

They waited until new opportunities in the US and European markets began to show themselves again. 

And in 2013, they started to do exactly that. 

As the US economy recovered, and the Australian Economy slowed down, the AUD began going back to traditional levels. That is why the Dollar is weaker now than 4 years ago. It will likely not reach those heights for a while. ",t1_cspiox8,t3_3bu22k,0,,,,1,False,,1437514221,australia,False,False,0,1435809697,t3_3bu22k,cspiox8
