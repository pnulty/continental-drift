Actually views have gone down a lot compared to what their previous peaks were.  You have less viewers for a longer amount of time with bo3.  It's not as important that the views might be about the same over time if they are chasing PEAK viewership.

I will watch a game of 2 ""bad"" teams, but I'm not gonna watch a single game in a bo3 with 2 bad teams.  Not everyone has the same viewing habits.  I mean, this gives me time to watch EU now too.

&gt;Cheese strats will hurt good teams

Part of being a good team is being adaptable.  If cheese strats work so well against good teams in bo1, maybe they're not that good?  Imo it's more annoying watching a good team smash a bo3 and helps level the playing field a bit if the ""good teams"" have to also prepare for cheese.

SmokingPuffin,,,"Bear in mind, I'm not a historian by trade.

The pre-WW2 import and export sectors were dominated by the [Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act) and associated protectionist responses from other nations.  Per the wiki, import and export were about 5% of GNP respectively for the US economy in 1929.

The post-WW2 export sector is rather a different story, though.  America enacted the [Marshall Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan) in 1948, and eventually provided ~$128B in today's dollars of direct aid, which led to an extremely rapid economic reexpansion of Western Europe.  On the other front, [Operation Blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Japan) was successful beyond America's wildest dreams, creating a pacifist, capitalist powerhouse state that remains among America's strongest allies today.  In both Europe and Asia, American factories found ready markets for export of finished goods and it would be decades before domestic suppliers could reasonably compete with American imported goods.

Overall, international trade rapidly expanded in the postwar era.  World Bank has worldwide exports as a share of GDP [tripling since 1960](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS), and 1960 was already a doubling as a share of GDP over 1930.

mademoisellerose,,,"&gt; This isn't correct, it's a common myth. Arabs were not limited to the peninsula until Islam and then they all burst out conquering everybody. Arabs settled the Levant millennia before Islam. Ghassanid Christian Arabs, for example, ruled areas of the Levant before Islam

I actually knew about this (this sounds super patronising but I'm not intending it to sound like that), and I should've expressed it differently. What I rather meant is that islamisation went hand-in-hand with people adapting Arab Muslim identity, rather than Assyrian Muslim identity. Thank you for this addition!!

&gt; Finally, Arab is an ethnic identity for most Arabs. Some view themselves as being Arab only linguistically, but I would say the majority of Arabic speakers would say that they are at least partially descended from peninsular Arabs, and this makes them Arab. 

I don't know if that can be said for the majority of Arabic speakers. Like there are Arabic speakers such as Syrian Turkmen for example who definitely don't ID as Arab. But I don't want to go into detail too much on this. Personally I identify as Arab as an ethnic identity because to me, it's not relevant whether I've got ancestry from the peninsula or not, or whether all of my ancestors were assimilated into Arab identity. I see being culturally Arab as what makes me ethnically Arab; and I generally don't think it's genetics what's the most important when it comes to determining ethnicity, but I'm trying to keep this as short as possible, so I won't elaborate.

&gt; Also, Iraqis were not ""more or less forced to convert to Islam"". This is some sort of simplistic anti Islam trope that's common these days.

I mean, I'm Muslim myself. Not devout or anything, and I don't consider my personal religious beliefs to be the most important anyway when it comes to me being Muslim — not sure how to express this best, but I hope the idea came across; I'll try and word it differently if it didn't. So basically, I don't have an interest in using simplistic anti-Islam tropes alt-right idiots use. It makes my eyes roll when the same alt-righters who will talk about how Islam was spread by the sword then act like Western imperialism and forced conversions by the Catholic Church in Latin America were inherently different, by virtue of being Western. 

&gt; As if no one ever chose to convert but were all forced into it. The Rashidun and Umayyads did not force conversion on populations as a policy,

See, just because I'm Muslim myself doesn't mean I'll have to believe that my all of my ancestors adapted Islam entirely willingly, **when chances are they didn't**. Islam spread by the sword, but it also spread simply because some people couldn't afford to pay jizya. Later in history, it also spread because Christians started converting to Islam to prove that their loyalty wasn't with the European crusaders. Yes, the Rashidun and the Umayyads didn't force conversion, but that doesn't mean the entire Middle East just voluntarily adapted Islam.

&gt;  and many populations converted quickly out of choice, such as Egyptians and Berber groups across North Africa.

Aside from the fact that this isn't historically true (the people of modern day east Tunisia alone left Islam **several** times and were ordered to convert back each time, and speaking of North Africa, let's not call the Imazighen ""Berber""!) and there are sources that contradict your statement — it's also not realistic, at all. What should make anyone just *quickly out of choice* convert to a new religion?

See I get where you're coming from, although I can't agree with you. It's disingenuous when Western historians imply the Islamic conquest was, by virtue of being Muslim, inherently different from the imperialism of Western Christianity. 

But you're not going to effectively rebuke this by turning around and claiming that the Middle East became voluntarily Muslim.",True,0,1506816361,,1506816576,0,dnqisza,False,t3_736ckl,t1_dnq16z5,/r/arabs/comments/736ckl/what_are_chaldeans/dnqisza/,1509189753,2,False,arabs,t5_2qt0d,

&gt; No dia 19 do último mês, o ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva foi alvo de uma fake news que dizia que o petista havia sido expulso de um restaurante em Natal. Para analistas, outro dado a ser considerado em presença das fake news é o grau de confiança do brasileiro nas redes sociais como fonte para a escolha do melhor candidato em 2018. Para o professor da Escola de Comunicações e Artes da Universidade de São Paulo (ECA-USP) Eugênio Bucci, o que impulsiona alguém a compartilhar fake news é a lógica do entretenimento. O sujeito vê aquilo e fala ‘eu sabia’.” Segundo a advogada da área do direito digital, Juliana Abrusio há dois principais perfis desse perpetuador de inverdades nos momentos prévios de decisões políticas: o idealista na faixa entre 20 e 50 anos, que faz de tudo por seu candidato, e o contratado, que faz tudo por dinheiro. De acordo com a advogada – que já teve entre seus clientes o senador Aécio Neves (PSDB-MG) durante a campanha presidencial de 2014 –, um processo por crime de calúnia, difamação e injúria, materializado em notícia falsa, leva de 6 a 12 meses para ter um desfecho. “Quando tiram de contexto um assunto para transmitir outra mensagem.” O professor de Comunicação Social da Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo Fábio Malini verificou que essas junk news, de 300 fontes distintas, foram mais compartilhadas do que as notícias verdadeiras sobre a delação de executivos e ex-executivos da Odebrecht no momento em que a colaboração premiada da empreiteira foi homologada, em janeiro deste ano.

MY-LITTLE-PONY-LOVER,flair-Custom,😘🦄🦄🦄🦄,"Boston's nearly four centuries of history are showcased by the city's must-see sites.Start your city tour on the Freedom Trail, which will lead you to landmarks like the Paul Revere House and Boston Common.Or, discover Beantown's artsy side at the Museum of Fine Arts and its fashion sense along Newbury Street.If you're a fan of baseball, you can't miss catching a game at Fenway Park, home to the beloved Red Sox. Though blowing through your travel fund is an easy thing to do in Boston, there are also plenty of things to do that won't cost  you a penny; the lovely Boston Public Garden and the lively Faneuil Hall Marketplace can be experienced without opening your wallet.Four buildings – Faneuil Hall, Quincy Market, North Market and South Market – constitute Faneuil Hall Marketplace, with the oldest being Faneuil Hall. Built in 1742 and now located on the Freedom Trail, Faneuil Hall has had a long and important history in Massachusetts politics.Samuel Adams once stood here to push for resistance against the British, and abolitionists and suffragists have stood on their soapboxes here.In fact, this is where Jonathan Mayhew famously challenged the Sugar Act of 1764 by proclaiming, ""no taxation without representation.""Since Mayhew's declaration, the marketplace has expanded to include more than 100 shops and restaurants.Some former visitors caution that the items sold at Faneuil Hall Marketplace are a bit overpriced.However, if you're looking to kill some time or snap some great photos, consider strolling through the market's halls.You'll also find various cuisines served in Quincy Market if you're in need of a quick bite.Keep in mind that this market gets crowded quickly (especially on weekends and in the summer), so it's best to visit during a weekday if you don't want to encounter hordes of people.The marketplace welcomes visitors Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. and on Sundays between noon and 6 p.m. (Restaurant and store hours may vary, so it's best to consult Faneuil Hall Marketplace's website before you visit.) To reach Faneuil Hall Marketplace, which sits just south of the North End in downtown Boston, travelers can take the ""T"" to the Aquarium, Haymarket or Government Center subway stations. Eight bus routes stop a block away on Congress Street, and a parking garage can be accessed on Broad Street. An hour of parking will cost you $28, but garage tickets can be purchased on the 75 State Street Garage website for a reduced rate, and parking validation coupons are available through select retailers. No fees apply to enter any of Faneuil Hall Marketplace's buildings, and free tours and performances are occasionally provided in South Market and outside Faneuil Hall. After Isabella Stewart Gardner's husband died in 1898, the art enthusiast bought land in Boston's Fenway area to open a museum to display her impressive collection of Italian art. The museum, which was fashioned after the Palazzo Barbaro in Venice, was completed in 1902, at which point Gardner moved in to the fourth floor and began installing her collection. Today, you can visit this Boston museum to get your fill of the Italian masters, such as Raphael and Titian. The building also showcases a cache of beautiful furniture, photographs, sculpture and rare books straight from Europe. In 2012, the museum unveiled a new wing designed by acclaimed Italian architect Renzo Piano. The most recent addition includes a glass atrium, greenhouses and landscaped gardens.Recent museumgoers said the collection captures Gardner's penchant for art, architecture and horticulture through its diverse displays. Though some previous visitors described the museum as a bit of a hodgepodge rather than a cohesive layout, many praised the property's vast collection of artifacts and intimate atmosphere. Also, remember to turn off your camera flash before entering since flash photography is not permitted inside.The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum sits a few blocks west of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston's Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood. Several buses drop within walking walking distance of the museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts metro stop is situated about five blocks away. Multiple parking lots are also located nearby. The property is open most days between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Extended hours are offered on Thursdays, and the museum is closed on Tuesdays. Tickets – which include access to all exhibits, as well as restrooms, a cafe and a gift shop – cost $15 for adults. Children 17 and younger enter for free, and reduced rates are available for college students, seniors and visitors with recent ticket stubs from the Museum of Fine Arts. Travelers who have Go Boston Cards, visit on their birthday or are named Isabella and register on the museum's website get in for free.The grounds of Boston Common started as a cow pasture in the mid-1600s. After a few years, overgrazing became a problem and the area was transformed into a British camp. After the Revolutionary War, the park became a popular locale for public speeches and rallies. Now, the Common is best known because of its status as the oldest public park in the country. You'll also find a variety of activities and events, including theater and musical performances, hosted here throughout the year.Though some visitors said you won't find much to do in this park, Boston Common is great for picnics or a leisurely stroll. Recent travelers also noted that this site is a wonderful spot to take young children. In addition to ample running room on the park's green space, kids can play at the Tadpole Playground or Frog Pond. Frog Pond offers a spray pool during the warmer months and an ice skating rink in the winter.Boston Common sits alongside the Boston Public Garden near the center of the city. The easiest way to get to the site is by the ""T"" – the Boylston Street and Park Street stations are located at the southern and eastern edges of the park – or by walking from downtown. You can also park for a fee in the underground parking garage or on the surrounding streets. The area is free to visit, but additional charges apply for food purchased at Frog Pond Café, rides on the carousel and ice skating on Frog Pond. Public restrooms are available, and in the summer, free yoga classes are offered by Frog Pond. The Common is open 24 hours a day, however, most park facilities are only open between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. To learn more about Boston Common, visit the City of Boston's website. And for more information about Frog Pond's events and amenities, check out the official Boston Common Frog Pond website.If you want to make the most out of the Museum of Fine Arts, one of the oldest art institutions in the country, then you'll need to spend a good chunk of your day here. The museum is home to one of the best art collections in the world, including the celebrated Art of the Americas wing. Inside this sprawling collection, which debuted in 2010, you'll stumble upon 53 galleries showcasing iconic pieces from pre-Columbian times to the 20th century. John Singer Sargent's dazzling pieces are one standout here, and as you delve deeper into the collection, you'll see his paintings sharing wall space with those by masters like John Singleton Copley and Edward Hopper.You'll also find an impressive collection of Asian art here, plus works from Monet, Renoir, Manet and Rembrandt on display in the European collection. And in special temporary exhibits, you can admire masterpieces from masters like Georgia O'Keeffe and Picasso.According to recent museumgoers, if you're an art lover, you'll want to devote plenty of time to explore. Additionally, consider taking a complimentary guided tour of the collections. And to save some money during your trip to Boston, plan your visit for after 4 p.m. on Wednesdays or on select open house days throughout the year when there are no entrance fees.The Museum of Fine Arts can be found a few blocks away from the Isabella Steward Gardner Museum and the Northeastern University campus in Fenway-Kenmore. Multiple bus routes have stops nearby, and three ""T"" stations – Museum of Fine Arts, Ruggles and Northeastern – sit within walking distance. The museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., with extended hours on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. If you don't visit on a free day or have a CityPASS or Go Boston Card, expect to pay $25 to enter. Children 17 and younger get in for free on weekdays after 3 p.m. and on weekends, while students, seniors and travelers with recent Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum ticket stubs receive discounted rates. Once inside, you'll have access to most of the museum's exhibits, restrooms, restaurants and gift shops. Separate tickets are required for select exhibits. Learn more about the Museum of Fine Arts by visiting the property's website.

Any reason why people are all taking this seriously on here? The Dutch person is delusional. Legal immigration from Europe to the US is nearly impossible for ordinary folks.

It's semi-rookie because three out of five never played on international stage.  When a random team like LZ manage to rolled over rest of LCK, you have to question the capability of the current LCK teams.

When you see this you might say well then i will have 1 or 2,looking at how hard is to find a good woman and how shit most of you are with jobs of anny kind,i will say its not even worth bothering if you dont make at least 3 or more since the impact will be minimal.
Also the first children were hell when they were a few months old,i think i havent slept a full night for more than 2 years.Raising fuck ups in the eastern block is hard,raising good people will be a titanic job(especially with just 800€ per month).

Racial slurs were first used to dehumanize, and, later, to threaten or demean.

What's more, a not insignificant portion of the American population is black, so there have always been important political and economic reasons for the prejudice, beyond personal ignorance. In Europe, for example, if all non-white people got together, there would be little power behind any movement, so, ironically, no need to try to keep them subdued.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

A breast-shaped hill in the Western Sahara.

Mola Murada, one of the mountains of the Moles de Xert, Spain. There is an ancient Iberian archaeological site beneath the hill.
A breast-shaped hill is a mountain in the shape of a woman's breast. Some such hills are named ""Pap"", a word for the breast or nipple. Such anthropomorphic geographic features are to be found in different places of the world and in some cultures they were revered as the attributes of the Mother Goddess, such as the Paps of Anu, named after Anu, an important female deity of pre-Christian Ireland.[1]

Overview[edit]

The Mamelon Central, formed by the Bory and Dolomieu craters, Piton de la Fournaise, on 28 brumaire 1801. Drawing by Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent.
The name Mamucium that gave origin to the name of the city of Manchester is thought to derive from the Celtic language meaning ""breast-shaped hill"", referring to the sandstone bluff on which the fort stood; this later evolved into the name Manchester.[2][3]

Mostly breast-shaped hills are connected with local ancestral veneration of the breast as a symbol of fertility and well-being. It is not uncommon for very old archaeological sites to be located in or below such hills, as on Samson, Isles of Scilly, where there are large ancient burial grounds both on the North Hill and South Hill,[4][5] or Burrén and Burrena, Aragon, Spain, where two Iron Age Urnfield culture archaeological sites lie beneath the hills.[6]


The ""Breasts of Aphrodite"" in Mykonos, Greece.
Also the myths surrounding these mountains are ancient and enduring and some have been recorded in the oral literature or written texts; for example, in an unspecified location in Asia, there was a mountain known as ""Breast Mountain"" with a cave in which the Buddhist monk Bodhidharma (Da Mo) spent a long time in meditation.[7]

Travelers and cartographers in colonial times often changed the ancestral names of such hills. The mountain known as Didhol or Dithol, Woman's Breast, by the Indigenous Australian people since time immemorial, was rechristened Pigeon House Mountain by Captain James Cook at the time of his exploration of Australia's eastern coast in 1770.

""Mamelon"" (from French ""nipple"") is a French name for a breast-shaped hillock.[8] Fort Mamelon was a famous hillock fortified by the Russians and captured by the French as part of the Siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War of the 1850s. The word ""mamelon"" is also used in volcanology to describe a particular rock formation of volcanic origin. The term was coined by the French explorer and naturalist Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent.[9]

2. Before FPL NA/EU In-House games were being played people who were at 7.5k+ mmr rating queuing for games at peak hours were being matched with other pro players. So essentially you'd be playing a public game with 7 pro players and 3 pubstars making games really competitive.

3. If you don't queue at peak hours the mmr difference between players will be big. This is because not many people have this skill rating. So to cut down the queue time it will place them in games with other players who aren't as good at the game as them. Players with 7.5k + mmr would have 4 teammates that are 5k-6.9k and the skill gap between them is huge. So the team with the less ragers and communicates better will usually win.

*Qabbalah* is the international Hermetic dialogue concerning Jewish Kabbalah. Basically a bunch of Hermeticists, and Hermetic alchemists, over  along period of time, adopted Jewish Kabbalah from the Jewish Diaspora (we are very talkative people) and integrated it into the understanding of the Mystery Schools already present and Europe at the time. There was already quite a lot of this intermingling of cosmic theory going on, but it got a huge jumpstart when the influx of Jews came into Europe and met up with the other occult weirdos in Europe. They were all sort of in the same boat, after all - hiding from the evils of the Inquisition.

So which is authentic? Both have their qualities...the Jewish Kabbalah tends to be too focused on religious devotion, while the Hermetic version tends to be too rigid in their views on doctrines that should have been rectified years ago - they didn't have access to Lurianic Kabbalah.

Cities being white has absolutely nothing to do with this. Race plays zero factor in this, for my opinion. Simply ideological, and economical, and cultural.

Sorry, but the Wright brothers still beat you to the punch.  I don't care that you put an iPhone holder on yours as that's not true innovation.

Two fucking battleships, gave German diplomats an Ally which could draw away nearly 2 million men from the Western front, blockade their greatest ally (Russia) and forced upon them starvation and revolution (Leading to the rise of the Soviet Union), while dooming Serbia(and later on Romania) and gaining into the Central Powers fold another ally (Bulgaria) in the region. 

Two battleships worth a few million that the British Empire couldn't even man, while Churchill was kicked from politics for nearly 30 years (Due to the Gallipoli Disaster). Not the Mention the Ottoman war in the Caucuses was a success and until 1917 the Ottoman Empire was doing a fairly good job at holding back the British and even invading into Persia (1/3 of Persia was under Ottoman control by wars end). 

I remember reading in a diary of a German officer who stated: ""If not for the Ottomans joining our war effort, Germany couldn't have sustained her war effort for two more years.""

Perhaps the Turks will even allow Russians ships into Northern Cyprus. 

This will be the end of the US containment of Russia in Eastern Europe and will force the US right back into the Middle East beginning a new Middle Eastern Cold War.

A WHITE HOMELAND
BLOOD, TRADITION, HONOR

Thread for discussion of a white ethnostate, a homeland to be carved out for the hardworking white man. The future of the white nationalists movement depends on European peoples migrating to and establishing a homeland for themselves exclusively.

&gt;The will to make the move.
Guys, I know we have a lot of fun making memes and hiding behind our computer screens like a bunch of botards, but the reality is unless we come together in large numbers to make a state of our own we're going to become irrelevant and fade away. MAKE THE FUCKING MOVE AND.

&gt;Skills
Skills are more important than any other tool you can possibly have. We need skillful people not just people that know how to say the word nigger, above all we need intelligent and physically capable people that have what we need to get this kick started.

&gt;Networking
Right now we need each other more than ever and we can't do that unless we know each other and are comfortable talking to one another. Quietly networking together is the best option for us because right now we're under (((Their))) eyes and they have their eyes set on making us dead.

&gt;Cooperation
We need to have very tight cooperation, we're all brothers here in a world that's against us, the last thing we need is infighting over stupid bullshit. Know your allies and your enemies well.

It was all flash and no substance.

Literally none of them were presented that way. The argument was that the physical world itself is an illusion and they went to great lengths to explain that Gods perceive it as such. It is salvation because humanity is left in a catatonic state. Moreover, Nanashi is part of the discriminated class and even gets loathing from Tokyo for conditions beyond his control regardless. 

&gt;And Nietzsche hated the things he felt came from Christianity such as democracy, pity, and the common good. Dagda try's to send you on a path whee you give up any sense of compassion towards your fellow man unwittingly or not setting you up as what your fighting against in YHVH.

Plainly false. Nietzsche hated democracy due to nationalism preventing a united Europe. He blamed Plato for that one. Pity is just about the only thing that you're correct about and the fact is that Nietzsche was right. Pity is condescending and proven to be a maladaptive social behavior according to modern psychology. It doesn't lead to actually helping others, it leads to turning a blind eye. 

For that matter, the entire fight was foreshadowed in IV and IVA. Nanashi and Yahweh are each other's diametrically opposed enemies. Dagda's presence doesn't change that and Bonds proves it.

Fuknmods,,,"&gt;You're both wrong. 

I made no assertion, merely stated the obvious contradiction of his statement therefore its impossible for my post to be wrong (except on calling him a shill but thats more insult than accusation).

&gt;The goal is to destroy every country on earth, including Israel. You're both obviously not familiar with Israeli politics. Netanyahu and Soros have been at war for a two decades.  

I'll admit I dont follow Israeli politics but do you have any proof for this theory of yours? The bit of theory i know of is the greater yinon plan which would expand israel, allowing it to conquer parts of the middle east which evacuate to and fight with europe. That plan alone is more reasonable than destruction of all nations since outside of white countries you dont have ethnic suicide anywhere. China will not cease to be a country for centuries to come. Neither will japan. How will they get asians to commit ethnic suicide via replacement when they cant even convince china to let non chinese own property?

&gt;They're using the Muslims in Sweden to act antisemitic and kill jews 

Who is they? The globalists? The swedish neo nazis marching in the article? Soros and friends as they try to destroy the concept of a nation? Be clear.

As for muslims committing crime thats just islam as its been since its founding. Even Muhammad himself raided jewish merchants for profit and its that profit which garnered his initial islamic followers. Muslims have been fighting jews quite literally since islam came into being. Muslims following their holy books and killing the non believers is what the quran preaches, not what anyone else commands them to do. 

If you meant the swedes in the article then you dont need islam to foster their hatred for jews, you only need to realize what it is that they peddle to your nation. Communism is a bolshevik jewish invention that killed over a hundred million. The media we both hate so much is owned by jews who, as you yourself claim, are purposefully deceitful to divide the people of a nation. A lot of the writers and tv anchors for the media and entertainment are jewish as well. These jewish agents then promote multiculturalism and try to bury the mass rapes and terrorism it brings with it. The modern idea of gender is also the failed jewish invention of Dr. Money. The most well recognized man haters in 2nd and 3rd wave feminism are overwhelmingly jewish. The frankfurt school and cultural marxism is also a jewish invention. Degenerate hollywood films that serve as leftist propaganda is a jewish monopoly. Pornography is an immensely jewish medium when it comes to professional producers of it. Even the very muslims you claim hate jews so much are part of the plan, see barbara spectre's admission of how jews will be at the center of turning europe into a multicultural hellhole. They did the same in the US; Jewish groups like the ADL and American Jewish Congress were influential in changing the demographics of the US prior to and following the passing of the 1965 immigration act which was written by norbert schlei, who as luck would have it is a jew.  Everywhere you look, almost every single fucking time, its a jew behind the push for degeneracy and degradation of the nation. 

People on this sub deride globalism but refuse to mention how involved jews are with its promulgation. It is no different today than during hitler's speeches when he referred to these globalists jews as ""the members of a rootless, international clique."" Even if not a single muslim existed in europe, so long as jews push filth and decay on a nation they will rightfully earn themselves nothing but condemnation and hatred. Any country would be completely justified to hate a foreign influence of that scale and magnitude. 

&gt;so the controlled media can exclude the race and religion of the attackers and pretend they're Christian white swedes. 

The media does this for any minority group though, not just muslims. Even then people are realizing this is the case, sweden has had an upswing with public opinion turning against immigration as of late.

&gt;They did it both to pressure jews and whites. Don't be dense. The media in the US does this shit all the time, you should be able to recognize this stuff by now.  

Pressure is good, we need change in the world. Yeah, what a surprise that jewish media pits one against the other using the tenents of the jewish constructed critical theory. I'm shocked.

&gt;But yeah, that guy you're talking to is a shill because he's not an irrational mouthbreathing Jew-hating retard like you. Sure, dude.   

Even if hes not a shill, the rest of my post holds true, his claim is contradictory and his conclusion is therefore retarded. There is nothing irrational about hating the people responsible for the very corruption of your nation and contrary to what you may believe I dont hate the average jew which has nothing to do with shitting up the west. Send them back to their homeland in israel since they dont dare shit up that home of theirs with the cancers they readily promote and invite to the west. May they live peacefully in Israel where their influence cannot destroy nations. Like trump himself said, if you cannot even name the problem you cannot begin to fix it.

kingkongjaffa,eng-Worcestershire,Manc in Worcestershire,"Im guessing you've never set up a workshop or factory?

You keep moving the goal posts, no one said anything about a self sufficient factory. 

Let's break down what someone would need to do for 2 scenarios. 

Dave in his garden shed has just bought a lathe which happens to be single phase powered so he doesn't even need any conversion from the mains. 

Dave plugs into his normal power outlets in the house probably on an extension cable and get to work on a billet of steel he bought online from any of thousands of suppliers it doesn't matter. He then sells his bits on eBay or Amazon or frankly rings up the man in Mogadishu and exports his bits - as long as his shit complies with the destination import laws  it will get to his man. &lt;- you can start doing that tomorrow and no one will check on you for anything ever. 

Scenario 2: you rent a fabrication unit like one of my clients my, this is a workshop split into a few units you would typically find on an industrial estate, happily the building owner supplies three phase power so Mike the small business owner can buy some heavy machinery. 
From there mikes story is exactly the same. 

You need explicit permission or approval from nobody if you want to make something and sell it somewhere as long as that somewhere doesn't give a shit. Export doesn't give shut unless it's something controlled, if I have bits of metal and plastic with ""plugs going to Somalia"" frankly there's no cause for concern there as long as it's not something that can be weaponised. 

Take selfie sticks, do you think someone checked every selfies stick that was manufactured in China to make sure it met every single regulation ? Not a chance. 

Again I genuinely can't believe I've had to explain any of this but maybe the manufacturing industry seems like a magic curtain where people would think or hope that there is more regulation, but as someone who works in the uk automotive industry and brings automotive and other products to market as a consultant too, please trust me when I say you can set up shop tomorrow and the actual thing you make isn't subject to very many laws until it's being used in a country that cares.

If you believe that this much regulation is actually in place explain how I can start an etsy store right now and be selling things to the uk/Eu public in under an hour?

ramalamasnackbag,,,"Thanks for posting this. One of the things that makes it hard to talk about having been in a cult is that cult members and ex-cult members are so stereotyped. Only weak people join cults, only stupid people join cults, etc. I ran across this quote from a cult researcher and it really hit home to me: ""No one joins a cult, they just delay leaving.""

I was in a cult for more than a decade. I had NO IDEA that it was a cult until shortly before I left. This was in part because, as you say, the media has people thinking that a cult means they don't let you leave, or that a cult means that a charismatic leader controls your personal life. Reading about cults described as ""high-demand groups"" really opened my eyes. 

For example, in the cult that I was in, there was no written rule that you couldn't stay friends with people who leave the cult. But the social pressure to not remain friends with people who leave is huge. The cult had a LOT of written rules, but the unwritten rules were much more influential and more strongly enforced by the leaders. 

I don't think ""my"" cult always was a cult. It didn't seem like a cult when I joined, and maybe it wasn't culty then. But maybe I was just naive (I was very young.) 

Ironically, I have always found cults and related subcultures fascinating. I had no expectation that I would find myself in one. When I realized I was in a cult, I left. But in the process of leaving I lost a lot of friends and the knowledge that I had been in a cult really hurt my self-esteem.

This is how Hitler gained power in Germany. In fact, it's fairly much exactly how he gained power if you go back and read the history of his rise. 


My proposal to the government right now to stop this violent movement in it's tracks are several measures. 


First off, remove any and all protections against public officials for any actions they may take that patronize these organizations. 


It needs to be a federal crime to protect these violent groups in any way. 


Calling for a police stand down when there is a violent protest against free speech, should be a federal crime against any official who does so. 

Failure to protect peaceful rallies, and it's participants, needs to be a federal crime. 


Anyone who gets attacked and injured by these groups, should be able to sue for damages. 


Covering the face in any way to prevent identification during a protest of any kind whether it be an organized and permitted protest or not permitted, should be a federal crime. It's a clear signal that the person doing so intends and had planned to commit a crime when they attempt to hide their identity. 


Infiltrating a rally event to protest and disrupt such an event needs to be prosecuted as a trespass and disorderly conduct. Standard procedure. It's not your rally so you have no right to even be there. 


Blocking a road, highway, freeway, interstate freeway, intentionally, should be a federal crime. Blocking or attempting to block people from entering a public building to participate in a political event, especially an election or political rally, should be a federal crime.

Comair Flight 5191, marketed as Delta Connection Flight 5191, was a scheduled United States (US) domestic passenger flight from Lexington, Kentucky, to Atlanta, Georgia, operated on behalf of Delta Connection by Comair. On the morning of August 27, 2006, at around 06:07 EDT, the Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet 100ER that was being used for the flight crashed while attempting to take off from Blue Grass Airport in Fayette County, Kentucky, 4 miles (6.4 km) west of the central business district of the City of Lexington.

The aircraft was assigned the airport's runway 22 for the takeoff, but used runway 26 instead. Runway 26 was too short for a safe takeoff, causing the aircraft to overrun the end of the runway before it could become airborne.

Aeroflot Flight 821, operated by Aeroflot-Nord in a service agreement with Aeroflot and as its subsidiary, crashed on approach to Perm International Airport on 14 September 2008 at 5:10 local time (UTC+06). All 82 passengers and 6 crew members were killed. A section of the Trans-Siberian Railway was damaged by the crash. Flight 821 is the deadliest accident involving a Boeing 737-500 to date, surpassing the 1993 crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 733 and the second-deadliest aviation incident in 2008, behind Spanair Flight 5022.

Ansett New Zealand Flight 703 was an Ansett New Zealand scheduled passenger transport flight from Auckland Airport to Palmerston North. On 9 June 1995, the de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft flying this route crashed into hilly terrain in the Tararua Ranges, 16 km east of Palmerston North airport, during an instrument approach in bad weather. The aircraft was carrying 18 passengers and three crew members. All passengers were New Zealand citizens except for one United States citizen.

Avianca Flight 52 was a regularly scheduled flight from Bogotá to New York, via Medellín that crashed on January 25, 1990, at 21:34 (UTC−05:00). The Boeing 707 flying this route ran out of fuel on approach to John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), causing the aircraft to crash onto a hillside in the small village of Cove Neck, New York, on the north shore of Long Island. Eight of the nine crew members and 65 of the 149 passengers on board were killed. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the crash occurred due to the flight crew failing to properly declare a fuel emergency, resulting in air traffic control underestimating the seriousness of the situation.

**British European Airways Flight 548**

British European Airways Flight 548 was a scheduled passenger flight from London Heathrow to Brussels that crashed near the town of Staines, England, soon after take-off on 18 June 1972, killing all 118 people on board. The accident became known as the Staines air disaster and, as of 2017, remains the deadliest air accident (as opposed to a terrorist incident) to take place in the United Kingdom and it marks as the highest death toll involving a Hawker Siddeley Trident.

The aircraft suffered a deep stall in the third minute of its flight and crashed to the ground, narrowly missing a busy main road. The ensuing inquest principally blamed the captain for failing to maintain airspeed and configure the high-lift devices correctly.

**Armavia Flight 967**

Armavia Flight 967 (U8 967/RNV 967) was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Armavia, the largest international airline of Armenia and the flag carrier of Armenia from Zvartnots International Airport, Zvarnots in Armenia to Sochi, a Black Sea coastal resort city in Russia. On 3 May 2006, the aircraft operating the route, an Airbus A320-200, crashed into the sea while attempting to go-around following its first approach to Sochi airport, killing all 113 aboard.

The accident was the first major commercial airline crash in 2006 and the fifth highest death toll of any accident involving an Airbus A320 after Gulf Air Flight 072, Germanwings Flight 9525, Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 and TAM Airlines Flight 3054. It was Armavia's first and only fatal crash.

&gt; Vektor is a progressive thrash metal band, originally formed in Arizona in 2004 but relocated to Philadelphia in mid-2012 and currently based there. They released their debut full length ""Black Future"" in November 2009, and the follow up ""Outer Isolation"" in December 2011 (both on Heavy Artillery Records, now defunct). These albums were re-released when the band joined Earache Records, and the band continued sporadically performing and touring in 2012 and 2013 with the likes of Napalm Death, Municipal Waste, Exhumed, Absu, Cattle Decapitation, and many more. They've done multiple headlining tours across the US as well. Their planned 3rd album is being written as a concept album, and Vektor will see their European debut in June 2013 at Hellfest in France.

Dr_Richard_Kimble1,,,"&gt; Yes but just about all previous polling suggests that the majority of people living in Catalonia agreed with the current status until shit got crazy. Independence had a minority in just about every poll until now and then there are also polls like this

Pretty much. You could say that it was roughly 50-50,49-51,52-48, etc. with a margin of error obviously, and that IF a referendum was allowed a few years ago when it should have been that in the end the pro-Union side and undecided's would vote reasonably and remain to keep the status-quo(keep in mind this is not a guarantee, but only the most likely outcome). 

Now Catalan people are completely pissed off and feel as if they have been insulted and are not going to vote rationally/logically, but emotionally with their hearts. Spanish Prime Minister addressed Catalonia this week and told the people to stop being ""disobedient"". With rhetoric like that you are just feeding the independence side. 

Long story short Spain's government has managed this terribly and I hope for minimal damage to the EU.

If we want to get very technical Spain's current government is basically the legacy of Franco and the Nationalists, and Spain is still using the fascist flag lol. Although I think they removed the eagle. The government is completely screwed up anyways.

Jaohni,,,"So, there's a few explanations here. Firstly, geography. Look at Russia. It's fucking huge. The Russian server is hosted in Sweden, I believe. At that point, your ping from Russia to Sweden (which is also the ping for Russian server), and your ping for EU East and even West are pretty much the same. This means anyone who set their region to automatic will probably end up in EU at some point, and any who looked at their ping once and then set it could queue in EU consistently. That said, some Russians end up in Japan as well, or even US West. It's kind of a crapshoot.

Secondly, a lot of Russians probably speak the odd word of English, and think ""well, I guess I can use this as my second language"" and since a lot of people (particularly people from Germanic countries like Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands), in the EU servers have very good English, they put that as their second language, so the server system probably pairs those groups together.

Finally, I dunno. Maybe they're trolling.

If it makes you feel better, I live in Western Canada, and my winrate in US East is like ~10% worse in US East, because we have tons of people from Peru there, who are kind of like our Russians, for more or less the reasons I listed above (although obviously their server isn't hosted in Sweden)

And also, not quite on topic, but if you're annoyed by Russians, then remember that you can learn to adapt to the Russian meta, and win games stupidly easy, if you just dive with them when they come to your lane, and play aggressively with your team.

Before I get downvoted to hell like I always do on these topics, I'm in Europe and we largely disagree with the ""Food under one is for fun"" stance, at least in this country. Four months is the recommended age for EFF babies to start solids, so long as they are ready. My daughter was crazy ready. Anyway, back to my point, the recommendation here is to start with solids for lunch to avoid bedtime digestion issues. Having said that, consumption of formula or breastmilk does taper off as you move to a four meals a day system. When we started with solids, it took a while to find the right balance. When, how much, do we top up with a bottle (again, different recommendations), etcetera.

""Moreover, as you said, there are certain requirements. Conveniently you don't list one of them."" Nor did you just now, but you did assume Catalunya would be non-compliant, which is sort of funny because the requirements are quite flexible and decided mostly case by case, with certain similarities. 

However the text of the ISDP does state: ""a people, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference""
This, in and of itself, makes it a legal possibility for the Catalan people to hold the referendum. I'm not saying that it allows them to separate from Spain, but this and freedom of expression (also and international law) make the referendum possible. They grant no legitimacy to its outcome, they merely make the casting of the vote itself legal.


""Then there is the constitution, which is above national laws,"" but not above international law so I don't see how this is at all useful. 

""Then there are national laws, also making it unlawful."" Same as above.


""Then there are Catalonian laws, and the one law that authorizes this referendum has been written saying ""this law is considered above the constitution"""" Yeah, I never said the Catalan government was a smart government, this is plain stupid, I agree with you, no national/regional laws are above the constitution.


The Spanish courts however have simply refused to apply international laws to this problem, this is my biggest issue with this whole problem, if the courts would've been fair and not politicised I would probably never have cared, however the courts decided they did not (have to) apply international laws, which is wrong. We live in the EU, there is an assumption that international law is immediately applicable if the person asking for its appliance can gain rights or direct benefits from the application of said international law. This was ignored in Spain. 


Anyway, I don't care enough about the catalans to see them independent, but I do care about freedom of expression which is why I'm pissed at how Spain handled this. They could've given vocal support to the referendum, raised up loads of voices for the no-campaign, and worked with the Catalan government to make the referendum go smoothly, in both the 'yes' and the 'no' vote this would've been. Beneficial to them and given them a real nice shiny sheen in the eyes of the international community. Instead they chose to try to fight this, blowing it way out of proportion and whatever happens, Spain will remain in the eyes of many people the country that tries to silence it's minorities.

sage1700,indigo,JSDF,"Hey.

Joint Strategic Defense Force is an International, NATO led, EU based, Tactical Fighting Unit able to respond in conventional warfare and asymmetric conflicts.

The unit mainly plays custom made co-operative missions against AI/Zeus; we have taken part successfully in large TvT joint campaigns and occasionally have internal PvP game sessions.

Operations are Saturday's 19.30 UTC, with mini-ops/training Sunday and Wednesday 19.00 UTC.

Members also have access to our 'Hearts &amp; Minds' persistent co-op mission server 24/7.

As a new member you will be able to join in any infantry squad role other than Leader. Specialist roles, including Transport/Armour/Recon and CAS are opened after a short requisite training.

The Unit hopes members will bring plenty of personality but leave ego behind and embrace a co-operative environment where team success out weighs individual glory. To this end there is a rank structure and in operations, orders from NCO's, Squad Leads and HQ staff should be respected; but we forego using Sir or rank titles when addressing each other.

Voting ends at 8pm ET.

-------- 

**What is HOT or NOT?**
 
HOT or NOT started as an alternative to the FOM’s DOTD vote, and has evolved into a great way for r/formula1 to elect (and argue over!) the best drivers and teams for each race.

**How do I get to vote?**

A link to the survey is posted on r/formula1 after each race by u/paulricard, be on the lookout! Alternatively, send your email address to u/paulricard or enter it in one of the surveys to receive a link to future polls!

Nessuno fuori dalla Spagna considera la Catalonia una nazione o tanto meno i catalani un popolo e nessuno li considera oppressi da Madrid, sono solo dei piangina esaltati che o sono stupidi e si lasciano influenzare oppure hanno da guadagnarci (tipo Farage e BoJo). Non sono indipendenti dalla guerra di successione spagnola, più di 80 anni prima della fine della repubblica di venezia.


Non hanno una economia che si è recentemente unita alla Spagna e che rivogliono indietro sperando di fare meglio (vedasi Uk), non sono poi così ricchi e tutti i loro proclami non tengono in considerazione il fatto che sono integrati in un sistema che li aiuta e che favorisce il benessere.

Non hanno alcun piano per domani.

Continuano a starnazzare che otterranno l'indipendenza e poi entreranno in EU dimostrando la loro sciempiaggine: la Spagna può e metterà il veto (e poi consideriamo anche l'intelligenza di chi vuole l'indipendenza e poi subito chiede l'ammissione all'europa: immagino che preferiscano le birre belghe alla cerveza).

If the people won't roll over and accept the present rigid order forever, they must be brought to heel (to borrow a phrase). And Spain is only, as my Spaniard/Cuban grandfather used to wryly put it, the ass of Europe. It's poorer than the rest of the continent, who look down on them with a touch of that old world racism. The economic wellbeing of Spain is fairly low on the list of neoliberalism's priorities. Just imagine what it might look like if this kind of groundshaking change had a shot at upending power in America. Trump might try and cancel the election, maybe even try to woo the centrist liberals against an American Allende by claiming that the commie Bernie (or whoever) is the true Russian Agent. How many of them would finally say ""Today is the day Trump became president"" and go along with him? ""Mr. President, this was never about you, it was about RUSSIA. Welcome to the #Resistance."" I know I can think of at least a few.

Fortunately, there's hope, I think. If I remember my Hannah Arendt correctly from college (not a perfect thinker but her stuff on power is really good IMO), she was of the opinion that this is what the last gasp of power looks like. If you watch these Barcelona videos, the cops seem to be in total chaos, Clockwork Oranging civilians without any goal or purpose besides terror. Haphazard state violence like this is a sign of a crumbling power structure, not a solid one. They can win a battle with these tactics, maybe even quash this referendum, but it will be an albatross around their necks next time.

&gt; Mobile styles aren't working correctly. e.g on a iphone 5 the calendar comes off the screen.

I have pushed a fix :) 

&gt; I'd also like to see the styles embedded rather than requiring 'import 'react-date-picker/build/DatePicker.less' or at least a CSS version.

I have added CSS version for your convenience to both react-calendar and react-date-picker. I wanted to keep the flexibility, so I've added another entry file that does not import styles automatically.

&gt; And bonus, is to accept different types of styles. e.g. you can pass classname for CSS Modules, pass styles object, etc. React-themeable is a good way to do it, or if you want small file size you can write it yourself 

Coming in the next release :)

&gt; I'd also like to see a render prop for the input so you can pass a customer input.

I think I don't understand. Could you explain it to me again?

&gt; An option to return the date as either a Date() or a string 2007-03-03 would be nice as well.

I'm on the edge with this. From developer's perspective I may appreciate convenience, but I've wondered so many times using date pickers how the dates are parsed. And sometimes it ends up being very confusing, especially for Europeans:

```&gt; new Date('2017-10-01')```

```&lt; Sun Oct 01 2017 02:00:00 GMT+0200 (Środkowoeuropejski czas letni)```

```&gt; new Date('01.10.2017')``` (totally European way to write Oct 01, mind the dots)

```&lt; Tue Jan 10 2017 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (Środkowoeuropejski czas stand.)```

So I'm a little bit on a mission to encourage people to use Date() for keeping dates :)

&gt; I 'd like to see an option to make it a native datepicker. e.g. a useNative prop.

&gt;- (...) potrzeba co najmniej kilkunastu miliardów atomów, żeby zabić człowieka (LD50), najsilniejszymi truciznami na świecie

&gt;- homeopatia operuje substancjami, które nie są tak toksyczne jak najsilniejsze trucizny w stężeniach co najmniej tysiące razy mniejszych, więc nawet jeżeli były by to najsilniejsze trucizny to i tak na organizm nie miały by wpływu przy takich dawkach.

&gt;- Popularny środek homeopatyczny na grypę, sprzedawany pod nazwą oscillococcinum, jest wątrobą kaczą rozcieńczoną w stosunku 1:10^400 (200C). Jako iż w obserwowalnym wszechświecie znajduje się około 10^80 atomów, rozcieńczenie jednej cząsteczki w nim wytworzyłoby rozcieńczenie 40C. Oscillococcinum dopiero w objętości wynoszącej około 10^320 objętości obserwowalnego wszechświata nie byłoby czystym rozpuszczalnikiem. Rodzi się pytanie czy aby wyprodukować go potrzeba wątroby. Drugie pytanie to czy czy nie jest zanieczyszczony słoniem którego stężenie wynosi tyle samo co wątroba kaczki czyli 1:10^400 z dokładnością do 1 atomu ;)

&gt;- Homeopatia to placebo II generacji

&gt;- Dobra rada – jeżeli już wierzymy w homeopatię, a nie które dawki fizycznie nie zawierają żadnego atomu z wyciągu to radzę podejść w aptece do reklamy i uśmiechnąć się do niej. Wówczas zażyjemy automatycznie od 12C (24D, 24X) w górę, tylko nie przedawkujcie. A zaoszczędzone pieniądze bo właśnie o to chodzi, przekażcie potrzebującym.

Nobody_Anybody,,,"“Samenwerken en macht weggeven of autonomie en je achter je grenzen verstoppen.”

Kijk nu doe jij het ook, dus of je werkt samen (en dan werken we dus via een EU principe) of je wilt een muur om Nederland (“je achter je grenzen verstoppen.”). Onzin natuurlijk. Je kunt prima samenwerken en toch autonomie hebben.

Niet alleen kan dat, dat is de enige werkende oplossing voor Europa. Veel verschillende landen met verschillende culturen, verschillende economieën, verschillende politiek en verschillende manieren van denken. De EU probeert daar een land met een cultuur, een manier van denken, een politiek en een economie van te maken. Daarom is het on Europees, en daarom werkt het ook niet want de mentaliteit van de mensen in die landen verander je niet zomaar even.

Je kunt prima ‘open’ grenzen hebben terwijl je soevereinen landen bent. Nogmaals, dat hebben we in de Benelux ook zo gehad. Je kunt je wel afvragen tot waar je gaat. Hou je bijvoorbeeld alleen geen actieve grenscontroles en zijn geen visums verplicht of mag je ook niet zomaar iemand (iemand uit een ander land) het land uit zetten?

Maar voor het idee van open grenzen heb je geen EU nodig en kun je prima soevereine landen zijn die met elkaar samen werken. Het grote verschil is wel dat je als soeverein land dit zelf in de hand laat. Wil je er mee stoppen, dan stemmen de burgers na 4 jaar voor een meerderheid in de kamer die er mee willen stoppen. Wil je er toch bepaalde voorwaarden bij hebben dan kan dan ook vanuit het nationale parlement geregeld worden. Het zelfde geld dan voor alle landen waar we mee samen werken. Dit in tegenstelling tot de EU manier waarbij ooit een keer iets is getekend en het daarna in feite uit handen wordt gegeven aan een centraal machtsorgaan.

“De EU wordt vaak gezien als een vorm van die intensieve samenwerking.” De EU is in feite een staatsvorm. Een manier van samenwerking zo je wilt. Iets dat ook op andere manieren kan, maar dan is het dus geen EU meer. En daar zit het zich dus ook in. Anti EU is niet anti samenwerking, maar anti deze manier van samenwerking.

“Mensen voor de EU zijn voor samenwerking. Mensen tegen de EU zijn voor autonomie.” Nouja, veel mensen die -zeggen / denken- pro-EU te zijn, zijn helemaal niet zo pro EU. Als je dan met ze praat zijn ze inderdaad pro samenwerking, maar vaak zelfs anti EU. Zo heb ik wel eens gehoord. “Natuurlijk ben ik pro EU, we moeten goed samenwerken, ik heb het alleen niet zo op dat gedoe in Brussel.” Tja dan ben je dus anti EU (dat gedoe in Brussel).
Dus hoewel de mensen die zeggen pro-EU te zijn, inderdaad vaak pro samenwerking zijn. Is EU toch niet het zelfde als samenwerking. Die mensen worden bewust voor de gek gehouden. Want dit is precies zoals de heren politici het over brengen. EU is samenwerking, en anti-EU is een muur om Nederland. Maar dat is feitelijk de grootste onzin die uit komt.

“Er zijn allerlei genuanceerde standpunten te bedenken (een nadeel van een ja/nee referendum).” Dit is ook iets dat ik vaak hoor als argument tegen een referendum. Maar dat is natuurlijk een stro-man. Je doet daarvoor namelijk eerst de foutieve aanname dat een referendum ja / nee moet zijn, om vervolgens het referendum aan te vallen op het ‘feit’ dat het referendum alleen maar ja of nee kan zijn. Dat is echter natuurlijk geen feit. Het is prima mogelijk een referendum te houden met meerdere opties.

“Je stelt dat alle pro-EU mensen kortzichtigheid stimuleren” Volgens mij heb ik niet gezegd dat alle pro-EU mensen dat doen. Wel eurofielen / de Pechtolds van deze wereld en de pro-EU politiek. Pechtold is al heel vaak gewezen op het verschil tussen EU en Europa, maar toch maakt hij bewust de keuze om over ‘Europa’ te spreken waar het de EU betreft. Dit zelfde zie je bij heel veel politici en zelfs media. En wanneer ze voor argumenten voor de EU wordt gevraagd komen ze met (niet EU specifieke) voorbeelden zoals samenwerking en vrede. Ja, zulke mensen zijn inderdaad bewust bezig kortzichtigheid stimuleren. En niet heel onbewust ook, want ik wil niet weten hoeveel burgers niet zeggen pro-EU te zijn (en dus pro EU stemmen) maar eigenlijk pro samenwerking te zijn maar juist anti EU. Als al die mensen deze nuance zouden doorkrijgen dan zou er mijn inziens weinig draagvlak voor de EU meer over blijven.

“dat ze anti-EU mensen over één kam scheren en geen oog hebben voor de precieze standpunten die anti-EU mensen hebben.” Dit zien we toch een beetje bij de referendums. Er komt een smoesje “dit is waar jullie tegen waren” dus hier komt een A4tje waar op staat dat het verdrag daar niet over gaat en nu jullie mond houden. Door van de EU Europa te maken, en te doen alsof pro EU samenwerking is en anti EU dus tegen samenwerking is, doe je dan in feite wel.

“Je generaliseert alle pro-EU mensen tot bedriegers die anti-EU mensen generaliseren.” Nee ik generaliseer niet alle pro-EU mensen. Ik adresseer juist de bedriegers die bewust het argument impliceren na pro en anti samenwerking.

Maar waar precies generaliseer ik volgens jou? Dat de discussie vaak bewust wordt gedraaid naar “anti samenwerken / pro samenwerking” is een feit dat jij zelf ook hier erkent. “De EU wordt vaak gezien als een vorm van die intensieve samenwerking. - Dit is, zoals jij terecht opmerkt, een veel te simplistisch beeld.”. Het opmerken daarvan is niet generaliseren.

Dr_Richard_Kimble1,,,"Thanks for your response. I believe we can all learn from each other as long as we are willing to engage.

&gt; In your brave new world with a global government what will safeguard us against the tyranny of the majority? 

Good question. As we know, global government will not be immune from the same things as nationalistic governments of today. For example we do not have global government today, but we still have plenty countries like Saudi Arabia, North Korea, etc. which are one party totalitarian systems. No global government needed for the tyranny, we have had 1000 examples of it in history, and that is all without a global government. So therefore tyranny is not exclusive to global governemnt.

So your question, what will safeguard us against the tyranny of the majority is a good one. The answer is the same thing that safeguards the USA from the tyranny of the majority. Decentralization of power, checks and balances, separation of power, guarantee of individual rights, etc. The global government should basically be modeled after western liberal secular governments, which have basic principles of freedom of speech, individualism, etc. guaranteed. Also guaranteed should be the right to leave such a union if one desired (European Union is a good example in that it allows its member to leave if they want).

&gt; For example what if 80% of the worlds population think ""hey you know what, let's just take all of the diamonds from the Congo and Botswana, we don't have to pay the people who live there for them, they won't be able to stop us."" The world government sends its robot army to the Congo and Botswana and starts mining all of the diamonds, the majority of people agree with this and the media portrays it as a positive thing, reminding everyone that they will get discounted shares in prominent mining companies if they support the occupation.

Ok, there are a couple of problems in this scenario. First of all Congo and Botswana would be part of the global union, they are not some foreign lands waiting to be exploited by the evil global union, they would be part of it.

&gt; It's not like the Congo or Botswana could secede from the global government and found their own independent states, they would be hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned.

Their right to leave would be one of the fundamental rights of such a union, just like the EU, but honestly by the time a global union exists I think humans will be so advanced they will not think of things like nationalism anymore, but still the right is there. 

Again, ultimately it comes down to the trust you put into the system you create. I can apply the same logic to the USA can I not? As a matter of fact, we saw in the USA during the Civil War that secession is basically not possible. This in the USA of all places.

&gt; Why does every progressives conception of a global government assume that the majority of people will be nice and will respect minorities? It doesn't seem to be the case on a global scale now.

I don't assume that. I truly am confident that if we work hard enough we can progress to the point where tolerance of differences of opinions, respect of minorities, etc. are achievable. 

Me, being an American I like to compare the USA of today to the USA of the 1800s. We have made PROGRESS (not always linear, it has ups and downs) in areas such as women's rights, minorities rights, elimination of slavery, etc. In EVER SINGLE CASE the conservative/traditionalist side was defeated, and they always use the exact same arguments to try and hold back progress and yet they always lose. This shows me that humanity is destined to PROGRESS i.e. progressive as long as we have the political will. 

I completely know where you are coming from by the way and I myself held similar suspicions of such ideas in the past, but if you think logically then there is really no other solution. 

You posed an interesting hypothetical dilemma regarding the diamonds, now I'd like to ask you one. 

This one is very feasible and currently a fact of life for many people/nations.

Imagine hypothetically if you are born in a country with very little natural resources, a desert area, no fossil fuels, very little water, basically very few of the essentials to make a prosperous economy/nation. As you mentioned yourself we do not choose where we are born do we? So it is not really in our control. So now I ask you, what are the people born in these areas supposed to do? There is no mechanism for them to basically improve their situation dramatically. How do they make it? Are they destined to be poor for all eternity with no chance just because of your good fortune in being born in somewhere else?

Another interesting dilemma is this one. This one is more something you have to imagine, but still the concept is relevant.

Imagine hypothetically, that we discover a natural resource in for example, North Korea. This natural resource has the ability to basically guarantee infinite energy for humanity or some other extremely positive attribute which could basically put the world at its mercy. It is ONLY found in North Korea. So now are we to simply be at the mercy of North Korea and its monopoly over this resource forever? I understand this one is not as compelling as the first one, but it is still an interesting thought experiment. 

Ultimately there is no denying the fact that certain issues require global solutions. If we are 300 different policies from each state/entity dealing with disease/vaccines, environmental issues, human rights, etc. then we will basically progress at a snails pace. Who would want that? Of course certain issues like taxation, entertainment, sports, etc. can be dealt with on a more local level.

Try to keep this vision of a sic-fi dystopian society out of your head when analyzing global government. Global government has the same chance of falling into tyranny as non-global government does. Was Naz Germany, Fascist Italy, Imperial Japan, globalist? Saudi, North Korea, Cuba, etc. globalist? 

Globalism does not automatically mean dystopian hellhole. As with ANY system of government there are risks and we should take precautions to mitigate the chances of falling into tyranny, as the founders of the USA did. 

Try to think 500 years into the future (if humanity still exists). We will have colonized other planets by then most likely. They will probably look back and laugh at the mere thought that nationalism was sacrosanct.

electriCT,metal,\m/,"Je peux pas la blairer perso. Mais de ce que je comprends, elle reprochait à Rousseau l'injonction aux victimes du viol à prendre la parole. Si je me trompe pas l'idée c'est ""chaque victime du viol vit la chose de sa manière à elle, et ça ne regarde qu'elle, la façon de le gérer. Certaines préfèrent passer à autre chose rapidement, ne veulent pas se laisser ""définir"" comme victimes, et on ne peut pas leur imposer de parler, de militer ou autre"". De la même façon que la victime de Polanski a fini par en avoir marre, et ne souhaite pas qu'on continue cette histoire - c'est terrible, ce dégueulasse s'en tirera indemne mais elle a déjà été violée, lui faire ressasser le truc toute sa vie est un peu une double peine.

Sur le fond je lui dirai qu'elle a pas tort. Par contre là où elle a tort c'est que les victimes sont bien souvent forcées de se taire. Donc oui il ne faut pas les forcer à parler, par contre c'est primordial de créer des ""outlets"" pour recueillir la parole des victimes et les accompagner dans l'après. Ce que Rousseau fait c'est peut être maladroit ou imparfait mais la démarche est plus que louable. Lui rentrer dans le lard de cette manière c'est faire le jeu des violeurs à mon sens. Angot a eu sa façon a elle de gérer le truc, qu'on ne peut que respecter, mais elle est écrivain, vit dans un monde d'intellos, de showbiz, en tout cas un certain microcosme.

Idontknowmuch,,,"The ones who are against consider that the referendum is illegal anyway. Although apparently they are a majority who want a referendum to decide - but a lawful referendum.

&gt; Haven't you heard the Azeri ""argument"" that the Karabakh referendum was bullshit because Azeris didn't vote at all

The Karabakh case was across ethnic lines. Armenians were a majority (70 something %) and the vast majority (over 90%) wanted independence. So there is no doubt what the will of the people was. The Catalan case absolutely is not like this and it is not cut through ethnic lines. Not to mention that there is no real clear cut ethnic division anyway, there are a lot of mixed families and Catalans who feel Spanish as well, etc. So ethnicity is not the main factor whereas in Karabakh it was.

They can know the participation though. And the Catalan president is on record saying that even a participation of 7% is valid as there is no precedent for a minimum participation in referenda. So in theory a 7% participation of 51% yes implies that 93% of the population which didn't vote don't get their voice heard and the region still gets to declare independence. This is not exactly democratic nor has any parallels with Karabakh.

There is a massive difference between Armenians and Catalans here as well. The only oppression Catalans face is not having full economic and tax independence (which is important for them I agree) and having their own independent state. They face no other oppression. Not exactly the case with Armenians of Azerbaijan. Yet they paint and actually say (check the thread) that Spain is literally a dictatorship like Turkey or another third world country.

What Catalans could do, and actually have been doing, is to work with Spaniards in changing Spain for the better, including make it a federal system or even to make regions be able to secede. This is absolutely doable, the last few years saw the left gain massive inroads in politics and they are for allowing a referendum. However this process was disrupted because some power hungry Catalan politicians couldn't wait to get what they want. The amount of propaganda is too much as well. Catalans have literally been bombarded for many years of how their money is sent to pave highways elsewhere in Spain and how they are more European than the rest so they need to secede. Ignoring that is the whole point of the European model, to share resources. With all of this I don't want to say that their self-determination is not valid independently of motives, which I don't. But it is not the same case. Armenians faced pogroms and deaths. No such thing has happened in Spain (and no, the police brutality you see now where Catalans are blocking police entering voting stations is not even remotely comparable to the pogroms Armenians faced).

&gt; I know that the comparison is kind of dumb because Spain isn't Azerbaijan

Look at the comments and how many literally say it is (although not naming Azerbaijan, but you get the point).

Finally they are on a crash course because what they are doing is going to harm Catalonia and Spain. There is no winner here. The Spanish government is acting stupid as well. It is a forced situation, with a lot of populism in it, specially from the Catalan side. Completely different situation with Karabakh. So when they compare the Catalan situation with the Kurds or others, it really is infuriating and insulting.",True,0,1506857777,,False,0,dnr3eu8,False,t3_73f2xb,t1_dnr2nen,/r/europe/comments/73f2xb/catalonia_referendum_megathread/dnr3eu8/,1509201009,1,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,

Twister___,,,"[1st October 2017, 16:00 – BIG (1.78) vs Space Soldiers (1.93) – EPICENTER 2017 Europe Closed Qualifier – Bo3](https://csgobets.com/match/86441/BIG-vs-Space-Soldiers-EPICENTER-2017-Europe-Closed-Qualifier)

Today at 16:00 teams **BIG and Space Soldiers** are fighting within *closed EU qualification* for *EPICENTER 2017*. Confrontation format is Bo3. Losing team will leave the competition, and the winner will get a chance to play in playoffs. Group B structure: HellRaisers, Heroic, fnatic, mousesports. Bets on [the game](https://csgobets.com/match/86441/BIG-vs-Space-Soldiers-EPICENTER-2017-Europe-Closed-Qualifier) are almost the same, but only one team will go further.

Opponents have not met yet. In last five matches, the Turkish team won four times, but [BIG](https://csgobets.com/team/BIG) scored three victories. Bookmakers odds: BIG 1.78, Space Soldiers 1.93. Last match Turks lost to Virtus.pro with a score of 2-3, although they showed a good quality of gaming. Space Soldiers in recent matches managed to beat EnVyUs Academy, FlipSid3 and Kinguin, and first two fights were with a score of 2-0. Despite the odds, [Space Soldiers](https://csgobets.com/team/Space%20Soldiers) have good chances to win in [today's match](https://csgobets.com/match/86441/BIG-vs-Space-Soldiers-EPICENTER-2017-Europe-Closed-Qualifier), but BIG is unlikely to allow their elimination from the tournament. 

**My prediction** is **the victory of BIG** with a score of 2-1.

The Catalan independence movement is backed in part by the far left party CUP. That's who we would expect Soros to partner with. The problem is, CUP are Eurosceptics and want an independent Catalunya outside the EU. Soros is pro-EU.

The group Soros funded (from 2013-14) to the tune of $27,000 (chump change for him) is called Public Diplomacy Council Catalonia, which according to the OSF projects list, *combats* Euroscepticism rather than foments it. And in any case it sounds like it has nothing to do with Catalan independence.

Then there was another group called SOS Racisme Cataluny that had nothing to do with Catalan independence.

No it doesn't, because the acquis communautaire is reserved.  Scotland complies by default because the United Kingdom does, as Scotland is no more or less a part of the EU than a public toilet in Cardiff, or Shahzad's MiniMart in Bethnal Green.

Quickest and easiest way around that is to assimilate all UK law on independence then vote on what you want to keep - yet people sneer at Theresa May for doing the exact same thing with the acquis when we leave the EU.

It's also a very slippery slope.  If Scotland is allowed independence to avoid Brexit, then where does it stop?  Can Bristol and Cambridge become independent?

You can say to just let them vote and say its unlawful. Ok and then what? They will try again and again. 

I live in Barcelona and think that the problems that the Catalans have will not be solved with independence but with good economic policies.
For example, the regional government is 42 billion euros in debt yet still receives millions of euros from the EU.

They could have voted for having more economical liberty from the policies issued by Madrid if that is gonna help. But independence? I think Catalans just want to be able to say: ""I have my own flag, look at it.""

As you mentioned, there's really not a lot of public transportation in the US to begin with. The whole country was built with cars in mind.

Meanwhile, here in Europe cars are not a good option. Even if everyone switches to self-driving taxis and the demand for parking spaces reduces considerably, you're still stuck with thousands of cars moving around the city centre. An underground rail system and compact buses are way more efficient.

Oax_Mike,mex,Mexico,"Absolutely. Within the context of truly well-traveled people I'm not really that well-traveled at all.

I've been to approximately 40 countries but in at least half of those I've barely scratched the surface. In Europe alone I can think of a dozen countries where I only visited 1-2 big cities. I've been to Paris 3 times, for example, but have been nowhere else in France (apart from a day trip to Versailles)...Dublin, Tallin, Riga, Amsterdam, Vienna...same story...I've been to the capital but that's it.

Most of my European travels were when I was much younger and hopped around too quickly...I did something stupid like 17 countries in 3 months on one trip alone. I mean, I was spending 3-4 days per city and not simply swinging my dick over the border to tick it off ""the list"" or anything but I was still ""new"" at traveling and not doing it ""right"" for a lack of better words.

I've never been anywhere in Africa. Never been to Oceania. Nothing in Central Asia. Nothing in the Balkan region.

I'm 41 years old and have been living as an expat since 2004 (Korea, Vietnam, Chile and now Mexico) so living in different regions makes it easy to visit new places.

Yeah, in this thread I mention trips to the Great Wall, Angkor Wat and Machu Picchu. But only one of those trips was longer than a week. In all of China I've only been to Beijing and then that day trip out to the wall - it was my first vacation from Korea before my wife and I got together.

MrMehawk,,,"It's already being fixed, gradually but continuously. The important thing here is that science as a whole has a remarkable success rate over the decades and to change it rapidly would be taking a completely unnecessary risk. The changes may seem slow and prodding within a single human lifespan but they are happening and gradually improving science. Making these changes faster risks one of the most important things humanity has to offer, every step needs to be taken with care.

In recent years, open access journals or at least a combination of publication in peer-reviewed journal and a version on something like arxiv.org after a while has started to slowly garner respect, different fields are still working out the details of how a sensible compromise can be found between open access and still having a high quality peer-review system - both of which are desirable.

Different organisations and projects are also working towards improving peer-review in various ways, either by creating independent quality checks or by thinking about novel methodologies (which again, due to their risky nature need to be checked before a change is implemented).

The reason you are aware of the issue of reproducibility is because it is actually already being discussed, already being addressed. You didn't come up with it by yourself. The improvement of peer-review and more open access are one branch of attempts to mitigate these problems and another attempt that is also being carefully experimented with is (again, depending on the field) broad-scale reproduction attempts, increased respect for meta-reviews / meta-analyses instead of single results and a bigger focus on statistical and mathematical tools to guide us through how significant something actually is.

On top of these, progress has recently also been made with regards to the publication of negative results, which would help science out a lot as well. Some journals and scientists are testing if there is sufficient interest in this and while this has yet to gain major traction, it is something that scientists have been trying to work out for a while and is now closer to being implemented than ever before. Another big recent improvement is that scientists more and more actually attach their data sets in certain journals which enforce or allow this, in order to make reproduction and checking their methods simpler.

On the issue of ineffective teaching practices, this decade has seen more progress and experimentation with new teaching methods than the entirety of the past millennium has. Flipped classroom models, MOOCs and their implementation within universities has been, again **carefully and slowly**, tested and experimented with in order to gauge if it is a viable option. One can't just knock over a well functioning system without being sure the new system is better. One thing is for certain, though, the terms flipped classroom and MOOCs will only keep gaining importance (within certain fields) and universities are also increasingly providing PDF format lecture notes and lecture streams, something that was impossible just a short while ago.

On the overproduction of PhDs, I'll have to politely disagree with you that there is even such a problem ""in science"" or ""in academia"". On one hand these are primarily economic concerns within certain countries (the US? I don't know where you are from but this isn't a problem everywhere, so not an issue of ""academia"".) you are talking about and academia shouldn't be changed as a whole in order to accommodate non-academic issues within a particular country. That said, as far as this problem goes you can only opt for one of three options: 

1. Create more jobs for PhD students (this is an economic issue and not an issue of academia) or 
2. create more strict entrance criteria with one of those standardized entrance exams which have largely been suspected as unrepresentative of academic success and thus would unfortunately eliminate potentially great scientists from arising or 
3. Let as many people in as you reasonably can, enabling people of varied backgrounds to take their best shot and have the unfortunate side-effect of possibly ending up with a few PhDs which will have to pursue non-academic jobs after their education.

It seems to me that except for (1), which isn't within the power of academics or academia, (3) is to be preferred over (2). I'd argue (3) is the status quo in most continental European countries at the moment, I think the UK and US are attempting a balancing act of (2) and (3) with sometimes better and sometimes worse results. But if you have a reasonable 4th option, I'm open to hear it.

To summarize: Academia is not ""broken"" but every human endeavor is flawed. All the issues you speak of are not only known, they are and have been in the process of being addressed for a good time now and improvements on most ends are undeniable. Rushing to ""reform"" one of the most important and successful driving factors of human well-being and progress because of a few ultimately small issues would be neck-breakingly risky and simply not worth it. Instead, academia is slow moving because it carefully analyses the changes that are possible and how they would impact the function of the scientific enterprise. If you value any one of these changes, a good thing to do instead of calling for reform, is to pick one of these issues you care the most about and either volunteer in the many projects working and experimenting on the issues or at least donate to their efforts if that would be too much work for you.

1) This issue should have been solved several years ago and referendum authorized, and I am very confident that the ""No"" vote would win the referendum, even pro-independence side admits this

2) Spanish government acted in very arrogant ways with its interference in Catalonian autonomy, for example overturning the bullfighting ban. Things like this just piss people off and give the independence side fuel. Bullfighting is protected by Spanish constitution now?

3) Spanish government made a mistake by deploying police in a half-ass attempt. They should have either deployed no forces at all and simply ignored the vote as illegal and non-binding, that way Catalans can't act as victims in the PR fight

OR 

Deploy a large amount of forces from a week ago. I am talking thousands and thousands of police to make sure not even a single polling station opens.

Spanish government instead chose the worst possible option which was to wait till the last day, send a couple hundred police reinforcements to Catalonia, a region of 7 million, and try to enforce a ban on the poll. This resulted in almost half the polls operating with no interference because there is simply not enough Spanish forces, and also made confrontations inevitable because small amount of police is now facing off with hundreds of thousands and maybe even 1 or 2 million people in the streets with impossible orders, so it is bound to get a little violent. 

This is why Spanish government is ultimately responsible and managed the crisis horribly and basically lost the PR battle. Now majority of general population of the world will sympathize with the Catalan side. 

Also, it did not help with Spanish central governments arrogant language and behavior in general. Spain's prime minister told Catalans to stop being ""disobedient"". Wtf? Disobedient? Catalans hear these words and feel insulted and it simply dramatically increases support for the independence side.

Amanoo,,,"It's a heavily arrogant culture, to the point of claiming full responsibility for everything they as much as helped with. ""We won WW2"", ""we invented the internet"", etc. If I'm to believe Americans, they single-handedly won WW2 (never mind the UK, Canada, the various resistances or Russia, the latter of which also seems to believe they single-handedly won WW2). If anything, they just came to the party late and helped finish it. And they seem to believe they invented everything in the past 200 years. Even though the WWW was invented by a Brit and a Belgian at CERN, WiFi and Bluetooth in the Netherlands, and git and Linux (which runs pretty much on every router, supercomputer, server, ereader, and lots of other things) by a guy from Finland. And there are plenty more examples like that. I'm an IT guy so those are just the first examples I come up with. Although the latter guy got American citizenship in 2010, well after gaining fame for his most important projects, so now I get to hear with some regularity how Linux was invented by America. 

Apart from claiming responsibility for everything good that happened to the world, the US will never claim responsibility for any of their fuck-ups. The US starts wars left and right, often for profit. They have no problems with droning civilians. Just a bunch of filthy non-Americans anyway, leave power vacuums left and right, and just destabilise already volatile areas in the process. They can afford to, since they can retreat safely to the other side of the ocean. It's places like Europe that don't have that geographical luxury and have to deal with the fall-out, which the US laughs in disdain at ""them stupid euros"" for having to do so. Whether it's droning thousands of civilians, or arming the mujahideen, or the act of starting those wars in the first place, if you criticise the US for any of it they'll just say how they ""keep saving Europe again and again"", as if single-handedly saving Europe (which I've already said they've never actually done) somehow grants the US the God-given right to bomb this planet to hell.

And it's annoying how the US keeps claiming things about itself that are as far removed from the truth as possible. They often act as though they're the epitome of cultural diversity. Even though they're pretty uniform with minor regional variations. The only way they're as diverse as they claim is if you count someone who's greatgreatgreatgrandfather was an immigrant. But the vast majority of Americans aren't Irish American or German American or whatever-American. They're just Americans and have been for generations. They also love to act like they're the only country in the world with freedom™. Even though they're the country with the most inmates per capita thanks to an utterly broken legal system. You can't even pop a bit of weed in many places. Might as well ban alcohol (again) at that point. It's also supposed to be the country where you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps. In practice, that's figuratively almost as impossible as it is in the literal sense. Socioeconomic mobility in the US is abysmal. Yet, Americans keep acting as though they're Denmark or something (if not even more socioeconomically mobile than Denmark). And while other governments may have laws that actively ensure the freedom of citizens, the US just doesn't have that many of those. That would be seen as ""socialist"". They just let society figure it out for the most part. Turns out some people have more of a say in that than others do, leading to a system with very limited workers' rights, among other things. And they act as if they're the only democracy in the world, while I'd argue they're hardly democratic at all. Not only do they have First Past The Post, already a ridiculous system in and of itself, but an implementation that's far more susceptible to spoiler effect, gerrymandering, lobbyism, or other forms of manipulation than any other in the developed world. And while FPTP is a system that typically results in a two-party system, no developed country has ever managed it as fast or thoroughly as the US. The only reason why it's thought of by anyone as democratic is the fact that they have voting. Which isn't enough. Even North Korea has a voting system (also based on First Past The Post, interestingly), but they're the least democratic country in the entire world.

cuavas,,,"Well, if you don't like what any of your politicians are doing, you can run as an independent in most Western democracies, or you can join the party in China or Vietnam.  In fact, some would say it's your civic _duty_ to do so.

The same is even more true with volunteer open source software.  MAME is a labour of love, done entirely in our spare time.  We aren't accepting money from users, we aren't answerable to anyone but ourselves.  There isn't some team employed to work on MAME with priorities set by a product manager, it's people who (for the most part) work on what interests them as permitted by their skills and resources.  You're welcome to make a fork of MAME that better suits your needs, the code is mostly BSD-licensed with a bit of GPL here and there.  We're also pretty accepting of external contributions provided they meet minimum quality standards.

When it comes to arcade systems, all the low-hanging fruit has been picked.  The remaining problems are hard problems, and they won't be solved by whining.  Things will only be solved when people with necessary skills, motivation and free time step up and solve them.  It's also becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to source remaining undumped games.

But MAME's arcade emulation *does* improve every month.  Look at the recent PCI and Voodo improvements that make The Grid playable and also help the IT Eagle (GT Fore, Big Buck Hunter), and Midway Seattle/Vegas hardware.  Look at the numerous improvements Angelo Salese made to arcade emulation in 0.190: Mazer Blazer and Great Guns are both finally playable, and graphics in Tecmo World Cup '94, Grand Striker, etc. are much improved.  If you've been paying any attention to release notes, you'll have seen the Gaelco arcade games that have become playable over the past few months.  This was the result of [hard work](http://www.afdelingp.dk/files/articles/ds5002fp/ds5002fp.pdf) and acquiring at least two working examples of each game.  This is an expensive undertaking.  You can't just wish for this kind of work to happen, you need to actually get out there and do it.

MAME is very important as an emulator for the less glamorous systems, as it's often the only emulator for these systems.  As the real systems become rarer, emulation becomes the only way for people to experience them.  MAME isn't just about playing free games, it's about preserving digital history, and all these systems are part of our digital history.

MAME is the only emulator for handheld/tabletop VFD/LCD games (including the Game and Watch and Tiger handhelds).  There were already simulators based on observing gameplay, but MAME was the first application to actually emulate these games.  These systems are not only nostalgic for '80s and '90s kids, they were a prolific class of electronic toys that's all-but disappeared.  It's important to preserve this so that future generations won't just see photos of these systems, but will actually be able to experience them.

MAME also emulates a lot of esoteric computer systems that aren't covered by other emulators.  One recently added example is the Intel INTELLEC® 4, the development system for Intel's first microprocessor, the 4004.  Another recently added example is the Kontron PSI98, used as a lab computer in Europe.  These are historically significant systems that risk being forgotten if efforts aren't taken to preserve them.

You also have to understand that the people working on computer and console emulation often aren't the same people who worked on arcade emulation in the past.  A lot of former MAME contributors have moved on with their lives, and new contributors have arrived.  Many of these people have only been attracted to the project _because_ it provides a home for emulation of all the esoteric systems that aren't covered by other emulators.  A number of active contributors also came via the former MESS project that was merged into MAME.  MESS started as a home for all the systems that fell outside the scope of MAME.  There's no point artificially dividing the developer community along lines like this, it just leads to duplication of effort when it comes to core functionality and emulating common devices.

And all that aside, arcade emulation often does benefit from improvements made allowing emulation of other systems.  Home systems typically had more software available that exercises more edge cases in the hardware.  This gives better test cases for MAME, so when the common components (e.g. CPUs and CRT controllers) work acceptably for these systems, you're rewarded with more faithful arcade emulation.

One example of this that I've rolled out before is the MC68705 microcontroller.  This chip is used in numerous arcade systems, but MAME's emulation of its onboard peripherals was terrible.  It ""worked"" well enough for games to run, but there were persistent issues like incorrect timings in Arkanoid, and incorrect enemy behaviour in Xain'd Sleena.  A number of computer systems use the same microcontroller for scanning the keyboard.  These applications give a far more brutal test of the onboard peripherals, because if you get the timing wrong, you lose or corrupt keystrokes.  Fixing it to work properly as a serial chip also fixed long-standing issues in popular games.

The argument that MAME has ""lost its focus"" or whatever has been done to death.  You can see examples of the same conversation being played out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MAME/comments/6x0fbu/a_growing_concern_with_mame_that_nobody_seems_to/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MAME/comments/72q4h4/mame_0190/dnkyl3b/).  u/MameHaze makes some very good points in both those threads.

&gt; Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont condemned the action of the national police and Guardia Civil, who were sent into Catalonia in large numbers to prevent the vote from taking place.

&gt; The ballot papers contain just one question: &amp;quot;Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic?&amp;quot; There are two boxes: Yes or No. Ahead of the polls opening, the Catalan government said voters could print off their own ballot papers and use any polling station if their designated voting place was shut.

sunshine4123,tr,Turkey,"This is against the rules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9

Rule 1: You are extremely uncivil, calling people and a user here directly; ""filthy"" with a comment filled with racism and bigotry; broad stroking an entire ethnicity as violent genociders, also calling all Arabs, Persians and Turks ""savages"" not to mention insulting a religion needlessly when the topic isn't about it at all; that is enough reasoning to become uncivil.

Rule 2: Extremely offensive and bigoted; see the examples above, you are also justifying, cheering and calling for violence multiple times in this post.

Rule 3: Calling all arabs turks and persians savages; assuming all Turkish teachers are racists and seek aggressive assimilation just because they are Turkish; ignoring very well documented crimes of a terror organization just because they are a specific ethnicity although their actions do not define that ethnicity. Calling an entire people bloodthirsty etc.

Rule 4: ""Our struggle is legitimate. Anyone who believes it is not is an enemy of the Kurdish nation and a terrorist."" Recruiting and supporting a group in conflict and this group happens to be in the terror list of US and the EU; I know this sub doesn't consider them terrorists yet recruiting for any group in this conflict is against the Rule 4 regardless.

Rule 5: I guess calling people bloodthirsty savages can be considered sarcastic; your post contributes nothing to the discussion; you sidetrack multiple times to talk about Iraq, Saddam and Persia and other times directly assaulting the poster you are replying to. Not to mention even bashing a religion in its entirety (even though a majority of Kurds are Sunni Muslims which is yet again interesting and misinformed) I feel these fit the sarcasm rule.

Rule 8: Your entire post is cheering death, justifying death especially against civilians and through terror tactics. You don't even have the courtesy of trying to explain the loss of civilian life as collateral of a conflict but rather you feel it is justified and necessary for civilians to be killed. Even if the teachers were willingly trying to ""brainwash"" the youth; you still can not raid schools and murder teachers in front of the students then torch the place, even against such assimilation tactics that is not a legal, moral or right way to resist and the fact of assimilation (willing participation by the teachers at least) is in question.

Rule 9: Darun's comment actually fits this more as he went into justification on a news article about airstrikes which is not exactly related, however you within your comment multiple times sidetrack and go in different tangents that are increasingly hostile and baiting, from your comment any Muslim, Arab, Turk or Persian person would feel the need to rise up to the challenge and respond extremely sidetracking the conversation in different directions; essentially this is a troll comment since such a distraction as you seemed to have aimed would have carried the conversation to unrelated discussions on conflict, Saddam, etc. under a topic about airstrikes.

Alas you can only report on one rule violation and I do not want to raise a challenge in any way, but whether or not your comment will remain after such broad and sweeping disregard for sub rules will be interesting to see and will be deciding factor for at least me personally.

Many in this subreddit do not understand what the meaning of ""involved"" is. Stacking troops at a border is not being ""involved"". It is preventing further conflict. To the extent that any person can not articulate objective reasons why Russia would get involved in a conflict between the United States and North Korea, their opinion is easily dismissed.

Sharing a border with North Korea is not enough. The reason it's not enough is because the costs of direct conflict with the United States and NATO are vastly higher for Russia than any benefit to participating.

Dr_Richard_Kimble1,,,"&gt; Spain is more violent than the rest of european countries? I don't think so:

I meant the Spanish culture, not its crime rate. They seem to value violence and blood as part of their culture and entertainment. Crime is a different story. 

&gt; I've seen you are very focused on the bullfighting issue in other posts, but neither me or any other spanish poster could answer your questions about it.
There is a reason for that. Most spanish don't care at all for bullfighting, and don't follow news about it. Attendance to bullfighting events has been on a steady decline for the last couple of decades, and if the trend continues it will die by itself.
Honestly, calling Spain violent because a decreasing minority still enjoys bullfighting seems quite extreme to me, but whatever. Spain has other, real problems, at the moment.

You say decreasing minority, but apparently this decreasing minority is enough to compel the Spanish government to overturn a ban on bullfighting in Catalonia?

Honestly the bullfighting thing was the most prominent thing that stood out to me because I just can't understand the logic in Spanish central government overturning that Catalan ban. It's an easy one for me. This action leads me to believe that Catalan claims of too much interference in their affairs is generally true. If Spanish central gov. would intervene over something like bullfighting then what won't they interfere with? See the logic? 

It's not an obsession of mine to focus on bullfighting, it just seems to me like that would be an easy one for the Spanish government to just let the Catalonians have. Why pick that fight? 

I agree that I shouldn't call Spain violent. It is still a modern, advanced nation in terms of most metrics. I just meant that it seems there are certain very unusual conservative traditions that Spain maintains and can't let go. For some reason many of them do indeed involve hurting animals … so I dunno.

""A lot changed Helsing, I am a real doctor now if you have a disease I am here to treat it if, you are here to play vampire hunter, I have no time, there are many patients that need help,""

""I got tired with the whole I am the Lord of Darkness deal, so I went to Bucharest, studied medicine, then emigrated to America, and I've been a resident doctor here in Cincinnati the for the last 5 years""

""It happens to the best of us, but how are you? How's the family?"" Acula is genuinely interested

""I think, you should spend more time with those who matter when you try to solve global problems you lose focus of what is important, leave the job and be with your family, learn from my mistakes, I thought that drinking other people's blood is good and that all I have to do is haunt them, without even paying attention to what they feel, and I was lost  but then I found my true calling and here I am, tired but happy, be there for your family, you won't get a second chance to be a good dad to your kids and a good husband"" Acula is almost preaching

Hishred009,,,"It's controversial, and it's abstract, but there is a logic behind it.
You see, the USA is the most powerful country in the world. Some countries have big economies (Japan), some have big armies (Russia), some have political stability and are relatively free of corruption (European Union... for the most part).
Now the USA might have it's problems, but overall it's got all of those things. Especially big guns and lots of money.
Now the thing about little countries, countries without big armies and big economies, is that they don't get much of a say in anything. An extreme example might by the Island nation of Tuvalu. This tiny island with only thousands of people is going to be swamped by rising sea levels. They don't have the armies to conquer new lands, the money to protect the island, or the political influence to force other countries to help them.
Tuvalu is about as weak as a nation can get. The USA could be stronger, and was a lot stronger relative to the rest of the world 20 years ago compared to now, but is about as strong as any country could dream about.
So why are US soldiers protecting your freedom? Well, when the US army uses its forces to achieve its goals - it's ensuring its citizens maintain control over their own destiny. The nation itself, the USA still decides what happens in the USA. Not like the people of Tuvalu, who would barely form a country town if they got transplanted into the US. When the USA signs treaties, flexes its muscles, drops bombs or innovates new weapons technologies it is protecting that freedom.
It's a lot more complex than that and, of course, thing like the Patriot act and the massive draining military budgets can make people argue strong cases to suggest individual freedoms are being eroded rather than protected. However, for the time being, the USA's imperfect democracy remains in tact and for the time being on most important policies the USA either gets their way exactly, or can prevent things they don't want to happen from happening. For now, their vast wealth and power gets them a seat at tables all over the world. The USA advises countries of their thoughts on all sorts of issues, treaties and other matters.

The_Circular_Ruins,,,"That paper is from '91. More recent papers, mostly from western Europe, assign about a quarter of the difference in age at death to biological factors and the rest to behavioural factors, among which smoking is a large contributor. [Ex. from 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4529900/):
&gt;An important health-related behaviour with a clear impact on sex differences in mortality is smoking (e.g., [3, 5, 7, 18–21]). Although estimates of the contribution of smoking vary according to the time period and the country studied, McCartney et al. recently estimated that smoking-related causes of death explained 40%–60% of the gender gap in all-cause mortality in Europe in 2003–2005 [5]. Similarly, based on an analysis of 44 European countries over the period 1950/55 to 2005/2009, Luy and Wegner-Siegmundt showed that smoking explained on average more than 40% of the sex difference in life expectancy in 21 of these countries, most of them in western Europe [7].

I don't think the question is settled, because as I recall US data is more equivocal. I was left with the impression that since one of the main avenues smoking exerts its morbidity/mortality effects is through cardiovascular disease, if smoking  contributes proportionally more to heart disease in Europe but is only one of several causes in the US, that might account for the differential significance.

finnylicious,,,"That's a gross and ridiculous oversimplification of an extremely complicated conflict. 

I studied the Spanish Civil War, and just dumbing it down to ''fascists bad, antifascists good'' is insane.  
The Spanish Civil War was decades in the making, and was the confluent conflict of dozens of groups, both left and right wing.

The war wasn't just the left vs the right, there was warring in the streets where anti-fascist leftist groups were killing other anti-fascist leftist groups.  
Communists were lining other communists up against walls and executing them via firing squad because they weren't the right kind of communists.  
The communist militias would take over towns and villages, kill the rich, and make life hell for the civilians who didn't aually want to live under a communist regime. 

Despite the revolutionary romanticism of writers like Orwell and Hemingway, many peasant spanish welcomed the fascists with open arms. 

The Andalucians, especially, who were poor to begin with and couldn't comfortably sustain any kind of socialist economy like the wealhier northern nations could, were very welcoming of the fascists bringing order and taking out the left wing groups that had been waging war in the streets with one-another.. 

There is a legitimate case to be made, and many Spanish Civil War historians have made it, that, much like Pinochet in Chile, the Franco regime was the best of a bad lot.  
This isn't at all to say that Franco was good for Spain, only that he provided the country with a structure and stability that stopped it collapsing into feudalism. 

This Catalan referendum is very much a remnant of the left-wing feudalism of the civil war.

Also, with regards to you blaming fascism itself for spain being less developed than other European nations, there is no reason to think a communist regime would have retarded the nation's development any less.  
In fact, as we've seen from history, fascist regimes often provide a nation with far more room to develop than communist nations ever could. Fascist dictators have pulled their nations out of abject poverty thanks to the raw structure they provide.  

I am not saying that fascism is a good thing, only pointing out that painting the Spanish Civil War as a black and white issue is either deliberately disingenuous or dangerously misinformed.",True,0,1506870472,,1506882162,0,dnra8ha,False,t3_73kqqo,t1_dnr65y9,/r/worldnews/comments/73kqqo/catalan_referendum_riot_police_fire_rubber/dnra8ha/,1509204704,-1,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,
Crook_and_Crank,,,"Hey, remember when idiots in the United States waved torches around and chanted racist shit, and every faux-intellectual with a Twitter wanted to inform you that it was entirely fine to violently attack Nazis because fascists are fascists?

...Where did they go?

The Spanish government has been promising to do *exactly this* for *quite a while now* since the referendum was drawing near. How much more fascist can you get than jackboots curb stomping peaceful voters so harmless they're holding their empty fucking hands up in the air whilst you beat them?

One woman has said the police broke her fingers individually to stop her from voting. Hello? There's - there's some really fucked up fascism going on, here. Where are you guys?

This is, uh, the one situation where you really *can* just point at something and unequivocally condemn it as fascism. If you'd maybe direct that at Madrid, all that supposed outrage you had at modern day fascism, maybe this could be stopped? It might have even been prevented altogether if you'd started when people tried to tell you this was happening. This seems like it would be right up your alley. Are you there?

I'm just saying, it's weird that you all wanted to make it very clear how we should never give the slightest quarter to even civilians that hold these views, but when an entire police force *enact* those views and start cracking open skulls in the streets, you guys are nowhere to be found. It's really weird!

And...come to think of it, aren't a lot of European nations of the same mindset? Isn't this the kind of politics that Merkel won another term through? The pseudo-progressive vaguely-centre rhetoric that likes to condemn bad things that are bad? Where is she? Where is the EU in general? You guys seemed pretty worried that a right-wing group got more views in Germany...shouldn't this be, like, extra double concerning? Because it's fucking horrifying?

Dr_Richard_Kimble1,,,"&gt; That's an if, not a when. If we get to a position where we have millions of colonists on Mars I would be happy for them to self govern or have nations if they chose to do so. I wouldn't be in favor of a planetary union/federation unless a solid majority of the planets population proved that they could behave rationally over a prolonged period of time. If we are in 2300 AD and secular democracy is an almost universal form of government and the majority of people are secular and socially liberal then it might be time to form a United States of Earth.

Let me be clear. I do not want immediate global government. I do not want to see USA, Canada, UK, EU, etc. in the same system as Congo, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, etc. What I do want to see is strengthening and maintaining the OECD countries through multi-nationational agreements (no bi-lateral) and then basically leaving the rest of the world open to the cultural onslaught of our secular, democratic, liberal values. Once other nations are up to speed they can join the liberal democratic order, and so on.

That's all I advocate is keeping us on a track towards global union, not establishing it before everyone is prepared.

&gt; Well, from around 500 BC to 27BC there was a Republic ruling most of Europe, then it transitioned to an Empire, then it collapsed and was replaced by hundreds of petty Kingdoms fighting endless civil wars. Then we had a theocracy, then we had rule by the divine right of Kings/family dynasties, then we had Empires and constitutional monarchies, now we are back to Republics again. The Romans thought that their civilization was going to last forever and denigrated other cultures as Barbarians, but it was the Barbarians who won in the end.

Yes, but once again look at the progress. During that Republic ruling most of Europe we still had slavery, women could not vote, etc. Today both those things are basically settled issues in the OECD countries even for the most conservative factions. That is progress. We have progressed, it is indisputable. 

&gt; The thing is demographic projections just don't bear this out. Most western nations are sitting on a demographic time bomb that threatens to destroy them. Put simply they are having too few children to be able to support their economies in the long run. The population of non-religious people is actually expected to decrease over the next century whilst the population of Christians and Muslims is expected to increase significantly. I think secular voices will be less influential in a century, not more influential. Unless your Star Trek style future involves the Pope firing photon torpedoes at blasphemers then it doesn't look like it's going to happen the way you envision it.

Depends how you want to manage the problem. If we first recognize the threat and understand what our goal is on this planet we can avert the crisis. If we however, turn inward and simply ignore what is happening in the rest of the world, we will indeed be overrun. So once again the globalist approach is the only way to save ourselves. Closing borders is only a temporary solution, not long term. 

If you want to solve this problem, first of all start encouraging family planning policies all around the world. Encourage the right to an abortion, contraception (thanks for nothing Catholic Church), and initiate proper aid programs which have been proven to reduce the population growth rate. 

Second of all the goal is not only to maintain the secular, liberal, democratic systems in the OECD countries, but to expand them to every corner of the globe. This is why isolationists and non-interventionits are short-sighted. They refuse to see the big picture and how it will *eventually* affect us all if we do not act.

As far as the Middle East, I can tell you from personal experience it is in current transition phase and it will be very ugly. It will be like the Enlightenment period in Europe except with modern weapons. Very bloody, but you will be surprised to hear that there are huge changes occurring in the Islamic world specifically with things like atheism growing very quickly. 

The question is what our response is. Best option is to approach it scientifically and rationally. We need buffer states between us and the conflict areas. States like Turkey and North African states need to be involved in this buffer zone policy and work from there. Right wing religious ideas should be basically sidelined and we should listen to our great minds instead of people obsessed with the temporary accumulation of wealth and inserting more jesus in our lives. 

&gt; Nope and western civilization is not unique in that respect either. Secular democracy is part of our culture and if our culture disappears then your new world order is going to be a theocracy.

That's why I don't want it to disappear. Nationalism, inward looking, etc. will make it disappear. I want maximum integration and working partnerships, military, economic, legal agreements between all the OECD countries. 

&gt; More pressure needs to be put on corrupt and authoritarian governments to reform. The UN is inadequate in many ways, that doesn't mean that a global government is the answer. Incidentally what would a global government do to help someone in Niger or Chad. Redistribute resources? Isn't that basically the same as foreign aid?

Ok, it seems you didn't fully understand the picture. Certain states like Niger, Western Sahara(Polisario Front), Chad, South Sudan, etc. are simply not viable. No matter what the government does, looks like, how it reforms there are not enough resources, opportunities to advance/progress in life for these people to have any other life OTHER THAN continuing to have children at high rates and continuing to live in poverty. Ignoring these areas will eventually effect us through exponential population growth. Where do you think these people with no opportunities, no resources, no nothing will head? We need to avert the crisis.

So I ask you again, what is the long term picture supposed to be for these people who were born there through no fault of their own? You do realize that you have been given the opportunity to live in the West completely by chance? Do you think people should be doomed to the life of poverty based on where they were born? Reforms and foreign aid are not enough to address the needs in the areas I am talking about. So what should be done? 

A global government would do many things. First of all the global government I am talking about would be based as I said on secularism, liberalism, democracy, overwhelmingly pro-science, and avoid ideological policies and focus on rational, scientific, logical policies. 

Resources would be redistributed, people would be relocated from certain areas that are not viable in the long term, and they would do this by choice btw as the people would be advanced enough to understand this by then. For example desert areas, Caribbean islands vulnerable to natural disasters, areas like Miami that are basically projected to go under water, etc. 

Everything would be done from a logical and planned perspective to a degree. Please note I am not advocating a planned economy, just policies based on planning. As Eisenhower said ""plans are worth nothing, but planning is everything"". 

Also remember I only advocate for putting us on the track to global government and only establishing said government when all its people are ready. Clearly when a region of the world is completely religious oriented they are not ready and thus will not be part of the global project. 

Foreign aid is not bad, but often times inefficient. We need active involvement, on the ground, we need a strategy. Not just throwing food at people, but we need to actually solve problems and remedy the long term problem.

Rubikia,artist,,"Weird World is our world with several things slightly…weird. In the year 1904, the Sino-Russian War broke out. Though mostly a land war, the Russian Empire began to send its navy west from their Baltic ports towards the Qing Empire. They feared an imminent Chinese attack using ships they bought from the British. On their journey across the North Sea the Russians encountered a British Trawler fleet and mistook them for the Chinese their feared. They  opened fire, killing 3 British fishermen. Outraged by the incident as well as the Russian interest in Tibet (the British thought this was a factor for the Sino-Russian War), Britain declares war on Russia with huge public support. Britain allies with Qing Empire in order to protect Tibet and India from the Russian bear. However, Russia called in their ally France in order to help them in the war in Europe.

Germany, being currently at war with France (and Russia but they were busy with China), decides to ally with Britain. The sick man of Europe, the Ottoman Empire, was secretly asked by France to close the Suez Strait to stop aid going to India, allowing Russia to invade. The Ottomans refused, however the telegram was discovered. This prompted Britain to declare war against the Ottomans, as in Weird World, the British Empire is insanely protective about the riches of India. The added bonus of war with the Ottomans was that the British could finally gain control the Suez Strait themselves.

And compound to that, the rise of China and South Korea in particular took even more of their shine, as the two countries proved to be though competitors.

Nothing to do with population figures. 

But from what I gather, you paint a picture that they will completely fade away in the global scene, which I highly doubt. 

1stly, they could allow more immigration from other east asian people, which they find hard to accept in the beginning, but may be ultimately forced to do. 

2ndly, I think the future would require less not more people to flourish. Advances like AI and automation will create new ways to create and distribute wealth. To me, the key is not having a huge number of people to work a country and to tax from, rather, your technological and knowledge base where you call draw from. Their people may be mostly aging and reduced, but they will remain highly trained and educated.

Of course, oil only has a few decades, at best a century left. So planning for the far future is necessary. In the immediate future however oil is still very, very important. 

But don't forget just as the alternatives become better and more widespread, the world's population and the world's economy are still growing and a fast pace. So by all indicators we might not even have reached the so called peak oil yet. 

Basically, it doesn't matter when the percentage of fossil fuels in the world's energy mix goes down as long as the overall energy consumption increases enough to compensate that. In Europe there's also a lot of opposition to nuclear energy and lot of countries want to get rid off the risk associated with it and the storing problems the just as much as they want to get rid off fossil fuels.

First of all, saying that the EU is a dictatorship is just plain out wrong. There is a parliament with representatives from each country that have been chosen by the people, there's a council with representatives from each country's government and there is a comission filled by bureaucrats and all of these three parts of the EU are equal, so there's no one all-powerful leader, which is literally the definition of a dictatorship.
 So just from the evidence of a parliament existing, we can prove that the EU does actually care about the democratic will, because if they didn't, why would the parliament have equal power, if not more since they decide on all the issues whilst the comission just propose then, to the bureaucrats? What's also great is that if you want to leave the EU, you can, which also proves the EU acknowledging the will of the people.
About Germany and the ""likes"", they do get richer in general by the efforts of the EU, but so does every single country that is in the EU.

recreational,,,"&gt; You mean that you hate it when people point out Stalin killed 20 million people? Not to mention how many other Soviet dictators, such as Lenin, killed.

No serious and academic estimate, post-USSR collapse, puts the death total that high, it's at least doubled even if we give Stalin credit for 100% of the death count of the Holodomor (and if we do assign that kind of responsibility, we find that Churchill for instance is not much better.)

&gt; When you start from the bottom, a raise isn't a significant achievement.

This is an attitude that people like to take to dismiss periods of rapid growth and industrialization, whether it's the USSR, Japan or China, but the fact is that most poor countries tend to stay on being poor, or improve in painfully slow incremental crawls. It clearly isn't that easy to achieve consistent and rapid economic growth, or everyone would do it. Where it has been done, we find a lot of very careful and considered planning, not things falling into place by happenstance.

Inheriting a semi-feudal state ravaged by war and then another several  years of civil war is not actually optimal grounds for economic growth based on a consensus of such cases.

For medium weight,

--How about a good Barbara d'Alba?

--Definitely explore the Cru Beaujolais. I love a good Moulin a vent, it goes with everything from Thanksgiving turkey to tortellini with butternut squash and sage. There are a number of different Crus to try and they're more food-friendly than many stronger wines

--I like a good Chenin Blanc, but the French versions are massively overpriced for the last 10 years IMO.  I'd recommend a South African version 

For Old World,

--I'm a Rhone girl through and through. They're not typically medium bodied, but the whites are simply gorgeous (floral, honey, fruits but with structure, particularly if there's Grenache Blanc in it) and the reds due to the Syrah are spicy and tannic but not oaky. You can easily avoid the fruit bombs at a reasonable price point, as long as you stay away from Chateauneuf (unless you're willing to fork out your 35-45 EUR per bottle which in the case of some Chateauneuf is completely worth it). You can range all the way from the Northern Rhone, which are more austere, to the Southern Rhone which fulfill everything I've ever wanted in a wine.  Further south, you have wines from the Cotes du Roussillon (primarily Carignan and Grenache Noir) and Beaumes de Venise, which makes not only the well-known dessert white but one of my favorite reds

--Try to find a Greco di Tufo from Italy. It doesn't get much more ""Old World"" than this cepage, which has been around for more than 1,000 years. It's not ""heavy"" but it's a rich, complex white wine you may enjoy when tired of the Sauvignon Blanc cat piss and grass profile ;-)

--Someone else mentioned Eastern European wine and unfortunately I can't get as much as I'd like here, some Croatian and Hungarian wines are out of this world.

you think that people's identity means that they want to separate or form their own country necessarily. that is not true, that is what **nationalism** is, which is nowadays thankfully waning. people have lived in countries they never identified with for millennia.

My wife, her two sisters, and I took an 8 night, Western Mediterranean cruise (Arrival Plus redemption to cover the fare) sailing out of Barcelona and ending in Rome.  I highly recommend [CruiseFish.net](http://cruisefish.net).  For $1.00, they monitor your cruise fare and notify you when the price goes up/down.  When I booked the cabins in May of 2016, it was $4,418 /cabin and that included the classic beverage package.  After 6 price changes/perk offers, my final price was $3,918 /cabin and we now had free gratuities, unlimited internet, a $300 stateroom credit, and the premium beverage package.

We flew out of ATL and enjoyed The Club (Amex Plat Priority Pass) in the International Terminal.  We took Delta coach ATL-BCN (Amex Business Plat.  58,000 MR RT per person after 50% rebate) and stayed 2 nights before the cruise at the Starwood property Le Meridian on La Rambla (20,000 per night).  Le Meridian was a great location if you don’t mind the constant crowds and noise of the popular tourist boulevard right outside the hotel.  For use, it was ideal as we don’t mind the crowds and the property was beautiful.  The café in the lobby had a great espresso bar.  Shouts to eatwith.com where we visited a local chefs house for amazing local cuisine with other travelers.  Other Barcelona highlights were tapas, the Sagrada Familia, Flamenco dancing, Picasso Museum, and some of the most aggressive driving I’ve ever seen.

From Barcelona, we set sail on the Celebrity Silhouette for 8 nights and visited Ibiza, Spain; Cassis, Nice, and Monaco, France; &amp; Florence, Italy, before ending in Rome.  Celebrity is a great middle ground between the lower cost cruise lines and the high-end luxury lines.  They have a great selection of restaurants and their staff works tirelessly at making your experience comfortable and memorable.  My favorite of the ports was Florence.  We only had one day there, but we were able to see Michelangelo’s David and a museum called Uffizi Gallery where a huge amount of Renaissance art was on display.  

The cruise ended in Rome and we stayed two nights at the Starwood St. Regis Rome (20,000 per night).  This property was incredible.  The newly renovated lobby and room were amazing and it was awesome to end the trip in a spacious room after spending all those days in the cramped ship stateroom.  Rome is my favorite city in Europe because of the incredible food, wine, and all the ancient Roman sites.

CrumblyButterMuffins,2-salt,"Struggle, Solidarity, Socialism","I think it's important for comrades to understand that this vote is essentially the culmination of the austerity that has been happening under the EU, and Catalonian workers and students have been wanting no part in this. 

It's also important to understand while there are bourgeois nationalist elements that are unfortunately still the media face for the push for independence, students have been occupying universities and workers have been organizing in neighborhood councils in order to figure out how to fight Rajoy.

The real solidarity between Catalonians and Spaniards right now is the struggle against Rajoy and austerity. The conversation isn't going to end at independence. Socialist should support the working class's right to self-determination and to have a vote on self-determination as a democratic principle. We can take that further and show that a capitalist Catalonia isn't enough and won't solve our problems. Demanding that with independence, we're going to fight for a socialist Catalonia, a socialist Spain, and a socialist world. 

Things are developing incredibly rapidly right now, and it's good to pay attention to some of the big forces in play right now. Here are a few articles to read on the situation.

corruptboomerang,wrcaus,,"I do think relegation is almost viable in the Rugby Championship. But I think you'd need to build a few organisations before you could truly make it possible. 

You obviously couldn't entertain the Major Unions being relegated (at this point at least), so Australia New Zealand and South Africa would have to be Permanent Members. From their you would look at the surrounding regions and they can be broken down into roughly three regions -- The Americas, The Asian and Pacific Islands.

In the Americas you have Argentina, Canada, United States, and Uruguay.

Then in Asia you only really have Japan but Hong Kong (or is it China /s) and South Korea appear to be moving forwards too.

Finally the Pacific Islands -- Fiji, Samoa, Tonga. 

Now the how you could go about it. I think the best way to go about your promotion/relegation would be to start with creating a 'Regional Rugby Championship' two games one home one away just like the Rugby Championship, the winners of each RRC are then invited to compete for promotion into the Rugby Championship, with one spot in the Rugby Championship being available for promotion/relegation (because at least at this point even if A/NZ/SA come last in the RC you aren't going to cut them simply because of the economics), the teams that wins the RRC then compete in a Round Robin Tournament during the June Test Window or perhaps End of Year Tours.

Promotion/Relegation would need to be for the upcoming year rather than the Rugby Championship immediately following the Promotion Relegation tournament. 

My biggest fear with something like this (as with any scheme like this outside of Europe) is the infrastructure is very poor and cost involved is very high. For example, a game that is played in LA is likely to cost around $3,00,000. About 40 - 50 people (the 33 man squad, 5+ coaching staff, 2-5 medical staff, 2-5 media people), flying non-stop to LA in Business Class because most of these guys aren't going to fit into an economy seat. Costing around $6,000 a seat.

Compare that to Europe flying from Lisbon to Bucharest (the furthest Tier two nations in Europe) have Business Class tickets for $600 to $2,500. Bringing the total to $125,000. But wait we can take a team bus it's a 37 hour trip but that's super viable, to Paris is only 15 hours. Driving from London to Paris is only 5 hours, the train is two!

Going from Fiji to Osaka is minimum $2000 a seat (and there isn't such thing as business class). So if you are going to have a team that is not financially viable and/or that is going to add such significant cost to the tournament, the tournament isn't going to work.

The only country in the Rugby Championship Zone who is maybe up to the standard and is financially viable is Japan, but even that is around $2,000 a seat.

When you are dealing with half a world's worth of travel and the infrastructure is almost non-existent in a lot of those places it makes it next to impossible to have a variable like promotion/relegation.",True,0,1506876130,,False,0,dnres41,False,t3_73la7l,t3_73la7l,/r/rugbyunion/comments/73la7l/relegation_in_rugby_championship/dnres41/,1509207456,3,False,rugbyunion,t5_2qkbe,

&gt; Sleep Party People is the brainchild of Brian Batz, a Danish multi-instrumentalist with a boundless imagination. 

&gt; Taking as inspiration the work of Boards Of Canada, David Lynch and Erik Satie, Batz found the sound of the old battered piano in his apartment, coupled with a freaky electronic alteration of his recorded voice, created an eerie, hypnotic sound. 

&gt; With his other worldly signature sound in place, this one-man home recording project started to take shape back in 2008, the collection of weird and haunting melodies he created forming the basis for Sleep Party People’s self-titled debut album (2010). 

&gt; Back home in Denmark electronic pioneer Trentemøller showed his approval by offering SPP a slot on his sold out tour - followed by The Antlers and Efterklang pledging allegiance asking SPP to join them as support on their Scandinavian outings. Appearances at Roskilde Festival, By:larm and Eurosonic along with an extensive European tour and a Youtube live-video that clocked up over 1.100.000 views further cemented Sleep Party People’s burgeoning reputation. 

&gt; The overall atmosphere he fashioned, one that evokes the disorientating world between being asleep and awake, wasn’t a conscious effort. “I’ve always been a huge fan of instrumental ambient music, but I never felt that I should throw myself into making such music, but when I started the process I really got the taste of it and began to love the blend between the organic and digital world.” 

&gt; The first taste from the second album “We Were Drifting On A Sad Song” (2012), A Dark God Heart, comes accompanied by an evocative video capturing the unsettling mood Sleep Party People so effortlessly create. The album received stunning reviews and got a lot of well-deserved attention. 

&gt; “As a sonic architect, Batz proves to be something close to a Genius ... Wonderful” 
The Sunday Times 

&gt; “An intelligent, delicate, crisp yet hazy and tentatively emotional record” 
Fake DIY 

&gt; After the release of the second album SPP toured Europe several times and played their first Asian tour too. With an evolving fan-base all around the world, Brian Batz traveled to San Francisco early 2013 to work on the third and forthcoming album. This time was different because he actually had two producers working and creating the third album with him. Using a month in San Francisco in the company of producer Jeff Saltzman (The Killers, Morrisey &amp; Blondie) and Mikael Johnston (The Sounds, Jane's Addiction), Batz achieved to record and write everything there and returned to Denmark with a nearly finished album. 

&gt; The 3rd album ""Floating"" is out may 30th 2014 in Scandinavia and june 2nd 2014 in Europe/Asia. 

&gt; SLEEP PARTY PEOPLE - the perfect soundtrack for your dreams.

ZardozSpeaks,,,"&gt;A PHOTO NEGATIVE of the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. Quite a supernatural object, considering that this is the one and only.

The biggest problem with this is the shroud shows no distortion from being wrapped around a body. It is flat as if it was a photographic image. That alone is extraordinarily problematic.

&gt;So it's very obvious a sample was taken from the area that was patched up in the middle ages.

No it's not. Patches are obvious and easily avoided.

&gt;Let me counter this by giving the more compelling evidence that a botanist has studied the Shroud and concluded that the flowers were from Jerusalem and the pollen on it was dated to 2 thousand years old.

Citation, please.

&gt;There's no way a fraud in the dark ages could have left an imprint of the teeth and created a PHOTO NEGATIVE.

Actually, it's the easiest explanation ever. If the image were positive on a white cloth it would be invisible. The only solutions were to either dye the entire cloth a darker shade *except* for the image area (which is extremely difficult to do and likely impossible for the time), or paint a dark color on a light cloth.

Given that the image *is* like a photograph, in that it is flat and doesn't look at all like it was wrapped around a body, and that the ""negative"" look is the easiest of all for someone to create using pigments at the time, I'd say this is pretty strong evidence that this is a fake.

Why we don't get actual bombings and shit that happens in the middle East is that the *real* terrorists, the ones that are trained and committed, don't make it into Canada thanks to currently used vetting processes and the diligence of our various security agencies. The people that come here are more than happy to leave that shit behind and become just as boring and non descript as everyone else. The extreme few that start getting ideas are either complete mooks that get busted by undercover RCMP officers, or as I mentioned above, strung out human sewage looking for the easiest path to salvation.

It cannot possibly be true because no one had ever done such a thing on this scale before. No one had any idea of exactly what it might mean for the UK to leave the EU. 

Almost every week we are reminded of this as new horrors emerge about what leaving the EU is likely to mean -  things that the leave campaign had failed to mention, either for reasons of ignorance or convenience.

The De Rothschild family is well-known to control central banks all over the globe, although they do so as secretively as possible. My comments about both the Fed and the destabilization of US currency (and, by extension, currency worldwide as everyone else followed suit after we ended the gold standard in our country) are factually accurate.

It's also no secret that Poland enacted legislation prohibiting Jewish immigrants from working in the financial industry of that country. It's *also* no secret that the Talmud teaches that Jews are genetically superior to the rest of the world and are destined to subjugate and rule over all of us.

Unfortunately, ever since the end of WWII, any negative commentary about Judaism as a religion (ethnic Jews don't actually exist anymore; the vast majority of modern Jews have European ancestry as opposed to actual Semitic ancestry) is viewed as racist, anti-Semitic, etc. There was a massive campaign to indoctrinate people into believing that Jews are *exclusively victims of circumstance* and therefore absolved of any suggested wrongdoing on their part.

Judaism has a sordid past, just like Islam and Christianity. All three of these religions are insidiously controlling and subjugating. It's just that, for some bizarre reason, when it comes to Judaism, we've all been taught that we're not allowed to acknowledge that or pay attention to it.

The harsh reality is that there is truth to every negative stereotype of every single group of humans who have ever walked the earth. That doesn't mean that negative stereotypes are necessarily entirely factually accurate, but you do yourself a disservice if you wholesale reject negative stereotypes without investigating what led to the creation and perpetuation of those stereotypes in the first place.

&gt;One: that it's everyone's end goal to make more money. I'm pretty sure white supremacists are going to be white supremacists regardless of whether it means they're growing their businesses as fast as the rest of their industry.

Everyone's end goal is to survive and prosper. Both survival and prosperity depend on having adequate income. Incidentally, when people prosper, they're psychologically far less likely to be drawn to extremist ideologies, because their overall mental health is improved by living in a society that is economically stable.

&gt;Two: if the majority of the people in a town are racist, then there would be economic incentive to have have racist policies, not the opposite. 

Then it's time to move. As a minority *of any kind*, you do not have the right to impose yourself or your own ideology on the majority group. This goes for literally *anything*.

If you move into a rural area where everyone engages in brush burning in the spring and fall and you have respiratory problems and can't handle the smoke in the air, *you have the obligation to leave*, **not** to demand the government bully your neighbors into discontinuing their legal burning.

If you're the only black dude in a small town of hardcore white racists, it's in your best interest to leave. You're not going to survive very well in such a place and are opening yourself up to be victimized by your neighbors. That's just common sense - stay away from environments that pose a material threat to your safety. The same goes if you're the only white dude in a small town of hardcore black racists, or Hispanic racists, or Asian racists...",True,0,1506883592,,False,0,dnrlmw7,False,t3_73f4vp,t1_dnrjpru,/r/POTUSWatch/comments/73f4vp/trump_administration_says_employers_can_fire/dnrlmw7/,1509211349,3,False,POTUSWatch,t5_3jgtl,

Not anymore. Humans are products of evolution and are social animals.  We like 'to belong' and associate with others and create a group identity.'

If we were robots, removed from Nature, etc. Then nationalism would seem silly. I now think that 'efficiency' is getting silly. We don't exist for the sake of existing in a world where everything is about the trains running even better on time.  I'm no longer a fsn of Universal 'group think'.
