Almost every article she does on Ars Technica is terrible. 

https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/if-you-read-one-sci-fi-series-this-year-it-should-be-the-broken-earth/

This is a bad article, with factually incorrect information, as well as opinion presented as fact. I read the first book, I have no idea what she is talking about. And it certainly isn't science-fiction. For further entertainment read the comments section in this article.

She's taking the clickbait skills she learned at io9 and trying to bring down Ars Technica to the same level. 

Let's take a look at some of the things in this article. Here's one of her quotes:

&gt;The book is set about 125 years in the future, and there hasn’t been some giant apocalypse that resets history. I didn’t want my future to make a mockery of how history really works.

And yet, time and again throughout history we have evidence of apocalyptic events indeed 'resetting' history, or acting as a catalyst for dramatic change. Some of these might include:

- the Black Death with destroyed almost a third of the population in Europe
- WWII which remapped borders and was responsible for massive advances in technology we enjoy today
- the Industrial Revolution
- the mini ice ages
- the quick destruction of the Australian megafauna ecosystem when humans arrived 60K years ago
- the disappearance of South American civilisations through introduced diseases and climate change

There are many, many more examples. Analee Newitz talks as though she is credible, educated and has intellectual integrity. Scratch the surface however, and she has none of these things.

rubemll,,,"Eles entrevistam na rua, ""a paisana"", 1 ou 2 pessoas (Entrevistador sozinho ou com verificador), tem a possibilidade de ligarem depois e confirmar dados da pesquisa (Supervisão conferindo se entrevistador, quando sozinho, não alterou alguma resposta).

São digamos em média 1000 (1300 talvez seja o máximo) entrevistas, e como é em horário comercial de metrópole, o público alvo é pouco representativo, QUEM é que vai estar a pé andando numa praça ou calçada de centro de metrópole numa 4ª-feira as 15h? Essa pessoa dificilmente é trabalhador, poucos são estudantes. Pra conseguir gente no perfil de idade e cia (Alguma centena de cada perfil) as vezes leva dias, digo, passam 50 aposentados por hora, mas só 5 pessoas de alto salário por hora, pra conseguir convencer um desses a parar e responder a pesquisa é complicado.

Quando fui meio ativo em partido sempre tivemos essa discussão, em quem método confiar, porque uns institutos fazem pesquisa assim na rua e só pegam desempregados e cia, outra faz pesquisa só via telefone fixo e pega bem outro perfil de pessoa, outro faz pesquisa perto de universidade de noite porque acha que o monte de alunos vai dar uma representação ok do eleitorado, enfim, uma pesquisa relativamente barata, com apenas 1200 entrevistas em diferentes extratos de idade e renda, ainda pode errar FEIO. Suspeito que o problema do DataFolha é ficar apenas em área pública de cidade grande em horário comercial, pega um perfil de gente muito específico. Aqui no interior (Era mais ativo em Cuiabá) o método que bateu com o resultado nas 2 últimas eleições foi a ligação pra telefone fixo, mas... o número de telefones fixos cai cada dia, talvez na próxima eleição não sirva mais (Eu tenho linha mas o aparelho fica no mute, não ouço tocar, logo, não atendo), e aqui a pesquisa na rua, quando testamos, erro MUITO feito, tipo dava maioria pro candidato do povão, porque entrevistaram gente andando a toa na rua as 3h da tarde, tudo bem que tinha gente de todas as idades e rendas, mas dava resultado contrário a pesquisa via telefone, e nas 2 eleições a pesquisa via telefone bateu quase na mosca com o resultado final. Só que em metrópole ou talvez outra cidade com menos telefones fixos isso não servirá, complicado definir isso.

&gt;**Grupo da USP monitorou 500 páginas de conteúdo distorcido ou falso em junho; para pesquisadores, tema terá protagonismo em 2018**  


&gt; No dia 19 do último mês, o ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva foi alvo de uma fake news que dizia que o petista havia sido expulso de um restaurante em Natal. Para analistas, outro dado a ser considerado em presença das fake news é o grau de confiança do brasileiro nas redes sociais como fonte para a escolha do melhor candidato em 2018. Para o professor da Escola de Comunicações e Artes da Universidade de São Paulo (ECA-USP) Eugênio Bucci, o que impulsiona alguém a compartilhar fake news é a lógica do entretenimento. O sujeito vê aquilo e fala ‘eu sabia’.” Segundo a advogada da área do direito digital, Juliana Abrusio há dois principais perfis desse perpetuador de inverdades nos momentos prévios de decisões políticas: o idealista na faixa entre 20 e 50 anos, que faz de tudo por seu candidato, e o contratado, que faz tudo por dinheiro. De acordo com a advogada – que já teve entre seus clientes o senador Aécio Neves (PSDB-MG) durante a campanha presidencial de 2014 –, um processo por crime de calúnia, difamação e injúria, materializado em notícia falsa, leva de 6 a 12 meses para ter um desfecho. “Quando tiram de contexto um assunto para transmitir outra mensagem.” O professor de Comunicação Social da Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo Fábio Malini verificou que essas junk news, de 300 fontes distintas, foram mais compartilhadas do que as notícias verdadeiras sobre a delação de executivos e ex-executivos da Odebrecht no momento em que a colaboração premiada da empreiteira foi homologada, em janeiro deste ano. Quanto mais visualizações do seu site, mais cliques e mais ganhos, os quais podem chegar a milhares de dólares.Este mecanismo é seguido por outras empresas como o Facebook.

m16p,,&lt;-- Referral links here and in Rankt | SFO/SJC ✈,"Since you are 0/24 (i.e., have gotten 0 cards in the last 24 months), the typical guidance is to focus on Chase cards first, since most of those are subject to ""5/24"", which means that if you have gotten 5 personal cards from any issuer (not just Chase) in the last 24 months you will be denied.

I'd highly recommend looking into CSR, CSP and CIP.  CSP is the card your wife has, it's a good card, though CSR is better.  CSR's annual fee is $450 but it comes with a $300 travel credit so the net annual fee is only $150 (vs $95 for the CSP).  It earns 3 UR points / $ on travel and restaurants instead of only 2 with the CSP.  It also comes with airport lounge access, car rental elite status with National and Avis, and a couple other high-end perks like that that CSP doesn't have.

Chase has a new ""one-Sapphire"" rule which means that you cannot get both CSP and CSR.  However, there is a workaround:  apply for both in the same day :)  So I would recommend applying for both of those in the same day.  Each card comes with a 50k UR opening bonus.  Alternatively, if you are not comfortable with applying for both, then get the CSR.

After that, get the CIP.  80k points for $5k spend -- this is a great opening bonus, too much to pass up.  It's a business card, though many folks apply with only a ""business"" (i.e., selling old junk on craigslist/ebay/amazon/etsy counts).  Note the 1/30 rule for Chase business cards (you'll be auto-denied for a Chase business card if you have been approved for any Chase card in the last 30 days).

After that, since you like Marriotts, getting the personal Chase Marriott card would be good.  There's also a business version you can get later (the business version is *not* subject to 5/24, so you can get that later).

FYI, transferring URs to Marriott is not a good option.  Depending on your travel habits, URs are worth a ton more value from them in other partners, like United, Hyatt, Singapore, etc.  For example, on business-class flights from DC area to Europe through United (flying either on United or their Star Alliance partners) you can easily get 2-2.5 CPP and sometimes even more.  With Marriott points I think you'd be hard-pressed to get 1.15 CPP.  In fact, if you don't want to transfer the points to another UR partner, then just using them through the Chase travel portal at 1.5 CPP with the CSR will be better than transferring to Marriott.  **Note**:  I'm not saying that Marriott points or their program are bad.  I actually like their program and am accumulating Marriott points.  It's just that the conversion ratio you get of 1 UR -&gt; 1 Marriott is terrible.  It's like getting a currency exchange rate of 1 USD -&gt; 10 Mexican pesos ... just not a good rate.

Re using Marriott card at Marriotts:  It's actually no good using the Marriott credit card for purchases at all (other than to meet the MSR for the opening bonus).  5 Marriott points/$ spent at Marriott/SPG is no good.  2 SPG/$ you get with the SPG cards is provably better, since 2 SPG = 6 Marriott (you can freely transfer points between them at 1 SPG = 3 Marriott rate).  And the 3 UR/$ you'd get with the CSR is usually better than 5 Marriott points too.

Re SPG card:  I'm a huge fan of the SPG card.  I use it as my ""default"" card since I think 1 SPG point is worth (slightly) more than the 1.5 UR's I get from CFU.  So getting an SPG card would definitely be good.  One thing to note:  the personal SPG card will count against 5/24 though.  If you plan to get into the ""churning"" game, then it is best to wait to get this until you are over 5/24, and instead get the business version -- Amex business cards are very easy to get with a ""business"".

Re JetBlue Plus card:  6 JetBlue points/$ spent at JetBlue is pretty good.  JetBlue points have a lot going for them, namely that they are very easy to use -- no award availability to deal with and they have a basically-fixed value.  I think 3 UR points *can* be worth more than 6 JetBlue points if you use the UR points well, though if you just redeem the URs for 1.5 CPP through the Chase portal, then 6 JetBlue points is better than 3 URs.  So, there's an argument in both directions whether you should get the JetBlue card if you get CSR.  Personally, I actually just got the JetBlue Plus card even though I have the CSR, since the anniversary points you get each year basically pay for the annual fee and the free checked bags tipped me over the edge to use the JetBlue Plus card on JetBlue flights instead of the CSR.  But note that like the SPG card above, this will also count against 5/24.

A cidade não tem quase nada de interessante pra turista. Mas para quem quer viver aqui tem um monte de coisa legal:

* ótimo trânsito, com pouco congestionamentos.
* boas escolas, com destaque prá University of Alberta, uma líder mundial em estudos de limnologia e algumas aplicações de inteligência artificial (jogos, reinforcemente learning).
* sistema de bibliotecas públicas apontado como um dos melhores do mundo.
* um dos índices de reciclagem mais altos da América do Norte e uma das maiores áreas verdes entre as grandes cidades do mundo.
* muitos, muitos imigrantes. Dá pra achar restaurante e loja de comida de qualquer lugar do mundo: Etiópia, Chile, Grécia, Filipinas, Tailândia, Irã,... O Canadá é uma esponja cultural, absorve cultura de tudo que é lugar do mundo.
* ótimos parques e centros recreativos
* índice de violência de 2.6 assassinatos por 100 000 habitantes. É um décimo do índice brasileiro mas está na média dos padrões canadenses.

Se você pretende visitar como turista vai achar pouco o que fazer. No verão tem o Fort Edmonton Park, uma espécie de mini-cidade museu com construções e utensílios do final do século 18. Tem também alguns bons restaurantes e um dos maiores shoping centers do mundo, o West Edmonton Mall (eu só vou lá quando tem visita, é grande demais pra fazer compra normal). Ah, esqueci, tem um parque florestal bem bacana aqui perto, o Elk Island Park. Se você visitar recomendo o setor sul: é mais selvagem, tem mais bichos e muito menos turistas.

They US has returned most of their soldiers from Europe. The Soviets thought the US weak, and that the threat of tanks and invasion would make them give up West Berlin to them.

Rather than reopen WWII or drop some nukes, they came up with the airlift. In a time when letters by air cost extra, the US and U.K. Shipped *coal* to Berlin by air. One day they had 1440 flights. One per minute.

The veiled message to the Soviets was two fold: we have way more money and productive capacity. We can support this as long as we choose to; and if we chose to load the planes with bombs instead of food and coal, and fly a little,further, we could reduce Moscow and Leningrad to rubble shortly. Just like Tokyo. *Wanna play?*

They turned down the hotheads who wanted to drop an A-bomb, as well as the General that wanted to drive to Berlin with a column of tanks.

They showed off a massive logistics capability, identifying the needs, prioritizing them and getting them tot he right points. Some kid had a rare disease and couldn't drink powdered milk - they brought whole milk for her. Someone else needed bananas.

My argument is that the club needs depth behind Motta. I don't know how anyone could disagree. 

&gt; I didn't say they play the same role I said they both play in the midfield. Right now we don't have much depth in the midfield and that's why Emery is moving Lo Celso there as a box-to-box midfielder rather than his Rosario role.

But we're discussing Motta and why the club may or may not need depth behind him. I have no clue why you even brought up Lo Celso in relation to Motta. 

&gt; He spend half a season on the bench and played like 20 minutes last season. Only now he starts to have more playing time, so like I said adaption to a new European league.

Lo Celso looks great, most would agree, and he was purchased straight from SA, the exact thing you're arguing against. You make no sense. 

&gt; It's PSG we're talking about. Every time we're interested into a player, the selling club is asking for an extra 5-10 million, just because it's us.

&gt; Also recent transfers of Brazilians to European clubs have been including some very high fees for young players who never played in Europe before. While Porto or Benfica have connections with many Brazilian clubs and agents and manage to get good players for 8-10 million... PSG doesn't have this power.

Wendel was priced at only 12m euros, so you've introduced yet another irrelevant point.

[deleted],,,"&gt; I am under the impression that these European countries are taking near ~50% of your income in taxes.

You might be thinking of *marginal* taxes and those only apply to income brackets that the vast majority of Americans don't fall into. Most middle-class salaries are barely taxed any higher in those countries than they are in the US. If those people were really losing half their earnings to taxes, they'd all be fighting to emigrate to the US and no sane rich person would ever stay behind. 

In fact when you look strictly at personal income tax, it can actually be lower in countries with universal health care. Even when the personal income tax is higher, it's often offset by lower taxes in other fields, e.g. corporate tax, inheritance tax, property tax, etc. For example, some Canadian provinces actually have lower income tax burdens than the highest-taxed American states. Singapore and Switzerland are *tax havens* - they offer universal healthcare systems yet rich people move there for the sole purpose of evading taxes! The UK has higher income taxes overall but corporate tax is much lower. 

Regarding your point about ""only citizens"", that is already enforced to some extent in most countries with universal health care. E.g. You don't need to be a Canadian citizen to use the Canadian system, but you must be resident there, so tourists can't use the system without paying. Even Canadian citizens living abroad cannot use the system for free if they come back for a temporary visit - there's a 3 month minimum residency period in most provinces before they become eligible again. 

I fully agree with you on ending birthright citizenship. At least one parent should be a citizen or have legal permanent residency in order for a child born there to receive citizenship.

&gt;I mean, the first part is news to me, wow.

If the Dutch guy wants to move to the Anglosphere he should look to Canada, Australia or the UK. The UK, obviously, is the easiest option - he can just move there without restrictions as long as he ends up there before March 2019.

Canada has a skills based immigration system, so he could probably immigrate there as a software dev with assets. His gf could come as a dependent if he marries her.

Australia has a points based and diversity based system, which indirectly favors Europeans (as more Asians want to come to Australia than Europeans). So Australia is harder than Canada, but could work.

The US is virtually impossible, especially in software heavy areas such as the Bay Area where h1bs are shunned by companies as they have other options and where other visa requests face tough requirements.

I will give you some sound advice. It doesnt really matter where you choose to live, as long as you buy large property outside the city and commute in. Owning your own property will keep the faggots away, give your family room to grow, and you'll keep your sanity by only commuting into the city and not living in it. Every major city is soul draining. You can buy large property in some areas with more then enough room to build, you dont need a small european shed, you can build a pool, a guest house, maybe shoot off some guns, blow up shit, burn shit, curse people you dont like, the american dream.

The Monchique Islet (Portuguese: Ilhéu de Monchique) is a small islet, west of the village of Fajã Grande, off the coast of the island of Flores, in the western part of the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. It is the westernmost point of Portugal and if considered part of Europe (although it sits on the North American Plate) it would be its westernmost point as well.

Approachable only by boat, the bay, which has water depth of about 43 metres (141 ft), provides opportunities for scuba diving during the day in the summer. The islet and the waters around it are protected for its rich biodiversity; ninety-six species of flora and fauna have been identified congregating on or in the waters of the islet, including the species of brown algae, limpets, barnacles and Mediterranean rainbow wrasse.

&gt; There’s no telling how far you’ll have to run when chasing a dream. You just have to be ready to keep pushing toward the next mile-marker. While some artists may dive into the music industry unprepared for the long road ahead, the guys of the Milwaukee-based band Vinyl Theatre are wholeheartedly dedicated to pushing toward the finish line. 

&gt; Together, Keegan, Josh, Nick, and Chris have found a strong sense of camaraderie in music and each other, writing and performing as a cohesive unit. In one another, they have found balance, chemistry, and an intense and unwavering bond. And in music, they have found something worth fighting for, something with no limit or expiration date, something they believe in. Even in their title, “Vinyl Theatre”, the guys have strategically placed elements of the band’s dedication. Not only evoking a feel that fits their style, the name emphasizes musicianship and performance, and serves as a reminder to the band of their fans, who the band says they “ultimately do this for, on and off the stage.”

&gt; Claiming influences such as Two Door Cinema Club, The Killers, The Shins, and Death Cab For Cutie, Vinyl Theatre has taken what they’ve learned from these groups with a grain of salt, making a conscious effort to focus on their personal sound and progression being distinctly their own and separate from their influences. The band defines their music as modern indie rock with elements of electronica and pop, a sound that is “unique and differentiating.” Marked with bright synths, catchy hooks, lush vocal harmonies, and loud guitars, and described by critics as “mellowly loud”, “pop-savvy”, and “delightfully dancy”, Vinyl Theatre has a powerful sound all their own that has been well-received by fans and critics alike. 

&gt; Having performed at venues and events such as Shank Hall, Bastille Days, and Yellow Phone Music Conference in Milwaukee, and Beat Kitchen and MOBfest in Chicago, the young group has had a fair amount of exposure to various fan bases in the past year. Vinyl Theatre has also opened for national touring acts twenty-one pilots, Royal Teeth, Parade of Lights, Makeshift Prodigy, Chappo, Five Knives, and Quiet Company. They have been featured on websites such as Frontiers LA, MadeLoud, JSOnline, and Milwaukee’s own Breaking and Entering as band of the month. Vinyl Theatre’s single “I Need You Here” was world premiered on California’s KX 93.5FM in Laguna Beach where their music is in regular rotation. Their music is also currently receiving heavy airplay in Europe, Milwaukee’s own FM 102.1 and WMUR, Marquette University Radio.

&gt; Their soon to be released EP, “Chromatic”, is not only a fun and upbeat album but a record to date of how the band feels they have grown and progressed in the year since their official start - from honing their art of songwriting, to continually strengthening their sound, to developing a powerful live show. With the strong and positive reception of “I Need You Here”, the group has high hopes for the album’s success and continued positive fan reception, believing their fans will hear their heart and commitment in every note. They hope their EP and unrelenting diligence will lead to more exposure and added momentum, propelling them through mile after mile, each one better than the last.

&gt; As of August 19th 2014, the band announced they had joined the Fueled By Ramen family. Their first full length album, ""Electrogram""  will be released the 23rd of September. While this album includes some of their songs from ""Chromatic"", there are also a bunch of new songs. They will also be opening for Twenty One Pilots for their upcoming ""Quiet is Violent"" tour.

in addition, nationalism generally means ethnostates..we know through history that a nation can never be pure. borders will never be static. for example, there are lots of Hungarians in Romania. Catalonia only for catalans ? Germany for Germans ? sounds a bit fascist does it not ?

This thing of race was used, basically from the beginning of our history, to try to justify terrible acts. In fact, black people, for a good part of American history, weren't even considered human by a notable portion of the population. 

Racial slurs were first used to dehumanize, and, later, to threaten or demean.

What's more, a not insignificant portion of the American population is black, so there have always been important political and economic reasons for the prejudice, beyond personal ignorance. In Europe, for example, if all non-white people got together, there would be little power behind any movement, so, ironically, no need to try to keep them subdued. Compare that to the US where non-white people make up a large amount of the population and consider the economic and political damage they could do to the status quo if not controlled.

The relationship of industrial capital and the Third Reich is one that is highly complex and the nature of international business adds a further layer of complexity. In 1920s, American companies saw Germany as a plum market by virtue of its large population and high degree of industrialization. This led to large-scale investment in German industries and subsidiaries opened up. Opel, for example, was established with the help of GM as a parent company in 1928. These international relationships continued after the advent of Hitler in 1933, but were often freighted with new political meaning that altered the relationship. 

Hitler's drive for rearmament caused some alarm among German industrial circles. Although support for the Weimar Republic was very shallow among these types, they were hardly enthusiastic fans of the new order. Many German industrialists resented state interference in the running of the factory floor and while more than a few welcomed the Third Reich's anti-labor laws, they also became packaged together with NSDAP organs like the *Deutsche Arbeitsfront* which was a sinecure for NSDAP cronies. On the extreme end of opposition, Hugo Junkers, head of one of the most prominent aviation companies of the interwar period and a firm believer in the peaceful use of airpower, was put under house arrest and the state forced him to surrender his patents and shares in the Junkers firm. Most German industrial leaders sought a cooperative relationship with the Nazi state, but the example of Junkers was a chilling one for those that thought of resistance. It made a degree of business sense for managers to patronize the new order rather than resist it. Wilhelm von Opel, the chairman of Opel, spent lavish amounts on gifts to NSDAP elites and became the chief sponsor of the National Socialist Motor League. American-owned companies or their subsidiaries often had to deal with this new reality, but it was still an incredibly complex picture. The Third Reich encouraged the cartelization of the German economy, which already was one of the most centralized in Europe prior to 1933, and American multinationals had to operate in this environment. Opel, for example, had to comply with the 1936 Schell Program, which streamlined German automobile production making it more suitable for military use, but Ford's Cologne plant was exempt from these restrictions. In contrast to Ford, IBM lost day-to-day control of its German subsidiary Dehomag. The New York company certainly did not welcome this development, but ut also  wanted to keep control of its near monopoly on tabulating machines, so it kept Dehomag  in operation to preserve the company's monopoly in Germany. 

IBM's case was paralleled in other major foreign-owned firms by the dawn of the war. While there were on paper owned by foreign concerns, they had been pretty much *de facto* German companies by this point. The management had been Germanized and Jews thrown out of positions of authority. The laws of the Reich prevented profits from cycling out of the country, creating a headache for accountants. Reports on day to day operations grew more distant and only more so after the war broke out. Foreign firms were complicit in this process of Germanization, some gambling that playing with the state would lead to a more normalized business relationship when the political atmosphere was more relaxed. Other responses were predicated on the fear that if they resisted, then the Third Reich would engage in outright expropriation and control. This was what lay behind the convoluted case of tetraethyl lead gasoline. This was an old technology from the 1920s whose American-owned patents and manufacturing data were relatively open. Italy had already in 1935 overrode these patents on its own accord and allowed a state-owned company to produce it. The fear in American circles (the US patent was owned by the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation which in turn was under joint control of GM and Standard Oil) was that Germany would follow the Italian precedent. Thus the Americans were more receptive to IG Farben's offer to form Ethyl GmbH with IG Farben, the German Standard Oil subsidiary, and Opel all sharing ownership. The protection of a large patron like IG Farben would allow the US firms to keep their trade secrets under some form of control, but the subsidiaries soon became passive partners as IG Farben assumed more control over Ethyl GmbH. Fears of losing control were also quite acute in the financial sector, both German and non-German owned, as they often operated under implicit threat that National Socialism saw such unproductive wealth as suspect and tainted by Judaism, which in turn made financial institutions more conducive towards freezing Jewish assets or other fiscal measures pushed by the state.  

The idea that the Nazis were ""thugs for the rich"" is a charge that actually dates back to the 1930s and was a staple of both socialist and communist propaganda of this time and in the latter case remained an orthodoxy through the Cold War. It has also been taken as a given by various anti-capitalist movements seeking to tar existing multinational concerns like Ford with the taint of the Third Reich. Such contentions generate more heat than light. Hitler may have held Ford and Fordism in high esteem, but so to did many other world leaders at this time, including the USSR of Stalin which practically enshrined Fordist/Taylorist industrial management as state doctrine.  The reality was of course far more complicated and part of the problem of examining American multinationals and the Third Reich was that of the latter's twelve-year existence, Germany was at peace with the US for eight of these years. American firms, like their German counterparts, found themselves having to adjust to a state predicated both on military expansion and a subordination of industry to the needs of the state. Most industrial leaders accommodated these demands, and more than a few profited from them, but many were uneasy with this arrangement. Even in giant German conglomerates like Krupp or Rheinmetall-Borsig that grew tremendously under state military contracts, their management fsoon ound that they were no longer masters of their own house. 

Therein lies the damage of reckless claims like those of Oliver Stone's.  Industrial collusion and corporate profits from the Third Reich is a serious issue and one that American companies like Ford and GM have been less than forthcoming about, as well as German firms. A lot of businesses operating in Germany recast themselves after the war as principled opponents of Nazism, but this was far from accurate, and sometimes was a self-serving lie. But a hyperbolic argument that is unsustainable actually makes holding these firms accountable much harder to accomplish and makes it harder to distinguish serious scholarship about corporate responsibility from noise. 

As for the larger question of could an economic embargo have hurt the Third Reich, this is an unanswerable question. Certainly Nazi persecution of Jews and the overall unsavory nature of the dictatorship hurt the ""made in Germany"" brand as well as inspiring boycotts. But such actions had little sway in middle of the Depression. Certainly foreign investment could have pulled their out, but plant would have remained and been nationalized in such a scenario. The Third Reich's general approach to international trade was hat it had to serve the interrelated goals of rearmament and autarky. Thus its trading policy often involved selling finished goods, often military weaponry, to weaker countries in exchange for natural resources. The US market did not really figure much in this calculation. More proactive measures by the American government and business working in tandem might have added more pressure, but the Nazi economy was already suffering the pains of self-inflicted wounds by the late-1930s as it had to play a complex shell game with its books to finance rearmament.

Jose_Joestar,PORT,Portugal,"Afonso Henriques thought he was too cool to be subject of someone else so he declared the independence of the county of Portucale, Portugal was born on October 5 of 1143, for the next two centuries the Portuguese kicked the Moors out and spread around the territory, in 1255 King Afonso III made Lisbon the capital, his successor King Dinis was one of the best poets of his era, he also planted several forests and invited foreigners to move in to the country to enlarge the population, after a succession crisis King João I came in to power, during that crisis he made an alliance with England that exists until today, he was probably the most educated man in the country, he also married an highly educated English lady and they made sure their children were highly educated too, one of the children, Henrique, known in the English speaking world as Henry the navigator, had the idea of exploring the ocean to find new lands, that was because Portugal was a poor country stuck between the Atlantic ocean and hostile Kingdom of Castille, they hope to find lands to colonize or unkown civilizations to trade with, he also hope to find the legendary Kingdom of Prester John, join forces and go fight the infidels, spoiler alert: Prester John was just a legend, we started by conquering Ceuta in 1415, in 1488 Bartolomeu Dias sailed past the Cape of Good Hope, the objective of reaching India and join the spice trade was properly created around that time, in order to make sure they wouldn't get in each other way, Portugal and Spain signed the treaty of Tordesilhas dividing the world in two areas, they promise to never get in to each other area, in 1498 Vasco da Gama reached India, in 1500 Pedro Alvares Cabral found Brazil, since the Indians didn't want to share their spices, the Portuguese decided to take over the business by force, for the next decade and something everything related to the spice trade that mattered was conquered, we monopolized the business for the next century, we also reached Japan and stuff later, later in the 1500s King Sebastião died in a battle in Africa leaving no heirs, his old uncle took over but he was a unmarried cardinal, after his death a succession crisis started with King Filipe II of Spain winning, Portugal and Spain were united under the same King, meanwhile the Netherlands, our number one client for the spices was at war with Spain so we stop selling them things, so they decided to take over the spice trade, war started, the Spanish saw little interest in helping the Portuguese fight the Dutch, so the Dutch had many victories and eventually took over most of the spice trade business, so we started paying more attention to Brazil, in 1640 the Portuguese rebelled and the Spanish were kicked out, our Independence was restored, in the last few years of the 1600s gold in large quantities was found in Brazil, we suddenly got rich again, King João V made sure to spend it well, as in living a life of extreme luxury, by 1755 the spice trade was making a comeback but then an earthquake on that same years annihilated the city of Lisbon and the spice trade was almost fully abandoned, after the earthquake King José gave full power to the prime minister the Marquis of Pombal who ruled the country with an iron fist, in 1807 the French invaded the country so the Royal family escaped to Brazil ruining Napoleon plans, the Peninsular war then started, the combine forces of Portugal, UK and Spain beat the French, after that the King didn't felt like returning home so a group of men staged a liberal revolution that demanded the return of the King, he returned, meanwhile in Brazil, the prince heir Pedro, declared the independence of Brazil, after João VI death Pedro refused the throne and appointed his daughter as Queen Maria II, but Pedro's younger brother was like ""not happening"", so he deposed Maria II and made himself the King, Pedro renounced the throne of Brazil and returned home, the liberal war started opposing Pedro in favor of a liberal/constitutional monarchy and Miguel who favored an absolute monarchy, Pedro won and after being king for a few months he gave the throne back to Maria, in 1910 Republican revolutionaries ended the monarchy, the first republic was a chaotic mess, we also joined World War I during this period, so to end the mess the army staged a coup d'etat and started the temporary military dictatorship, they gave power to an economy teacher, Salazar, Salazar put the country in order and after winning the next elections he created the ""New State"" regime, his own dictatorship, the African colonies eventually rebelled in the 50s, starting the colonial wars, the regime and the war came to an end when the army made the April 25 revolution in 1974, Portugal finally became a democracy, in 1985 we joined the European Union, in 2016 we won the European Cup and in 2017 we won the Eurovision song contest.

The globalist regime wants a world of dumbed down shitskins they can easily rule over.
This is why corporate culture is now trying to shift its focus to ""urban"" and ""people of color"" culture in order to create a global corporate culture shitskins can identify with.
Wonder why suddenly all the shitskins are adopting hollywood nigger culture?

This is why shitskins are being flooded into Europe, because the Europeans are now against the NWO/Corporate system, they need people to vote for them.
If the majority population are braindead zombified shitskins that the NWO can appeal to they'll constantly win the vote.

Basically the people behind the destruction of the US are doing the same to the entire globe so they can turn everyone into an obedient consumerist.
If they had their way in 50 years it wouldn't matter what part of the planet you visit everyone would be exactly the same, they would all be purchasing from the same corporate companies.

If you want to prevent the destruction of western civilization and European culture/race then you have to stop associating with corporate/mass culture.

**Event 5823-2:** MTF Zeta Delta 5 encountered and engaged the hostile SCP-5823-2 instances and were successful in putting down all but two, designated SCP-5823-2-1, who disappeared by anomalous means, and SCP-5823-2-2, who was apprehended and contained in a standard humanoid containment unit at nearby Site █ ███. Interrogation and experimentation revealed the existence of SCP-5823-3 and preliminary information about its function.

------

*Tom could hardly believe it. All his Death Eaters, slain unceremoniously when there should have been nothing to stop them. What new magic was this? How could there be wizardry that he was not aware of?*

*Bellatrix was captured, and Tom just barely managed to escape unscathed. He instinctively returned to Hogwarts, and upon arriving realized he had no plan. Lord Voldemort was the greatest wizard to ever live -- and yet here he was, his magic seemingly useless, and his right-hand men and women gone. *

*Tom wandered around the empty castle, wondering what he could have missed. Certainly no mere muggles could have defeated his magic -- there must have been some other spell in play, something he had somehow never heard of...and if it was magic, then he could beat it. Feeling an angry sense of confidence, he strode to the old Headmaster's office --*

------

**Event 5823-3:** Further contact with hostile SCP-5823-2 instances leads to additional captures and interrogation. A history of SCP-5823 is formed and determined to stretch back to ██ ███ if not earlier. Interviews with more compliant SCP-5823-2 instances leads to the discovery of locations in Eastern Europe, Western Europe and the Eastern US that play host to organizations of SCP-5823-2 instances. Due to the widespread influence of SCP-5823 and the growing publicity of its effects and presence, Procedure 5823-Daniel is modified to incorporate Class X amnestics that have completed testing and are ready for deployment.

------

*Tom took his time in old Dumbledore's former office. There was the cage for Faux, the now-missing Phoenix. There was the stand for the Sorting Hat. And there was the entrance to his secret library... certainly here there would be information that would be useful in taking down these strange enemies. He began rummaging through the more obscure books --*

------

**Event 5823-4:** Experimentation has been able to determine that SCP-5823-3 is instrumental to progression of an SCP-5823-1 instance to SCP-5823-2. Facing the serious possibility of a CK-class reality restructuring scenario, the O5 council approved the deployment of Procedure 5823-Daniel. As a result, all instances of SCP-5823-3 have been rendered non-anomalous and all SCP-5823-2 instances have had their knowledge pertaining to the creation and use of SCP-5823-3 censured. Object Class and containment procedures have been updated accordingly, and MTF Zeta-Delta-5 has been dispatched to known hotspots of SCP-5823-2 activity for containment and questioning.

------

*Midway through reading an ancient text, Tom felt something hot in his robe pocket. He instinctively reached for the Elder Wand and instead found a puddle of liquid water. He began to recoil in horror, when suddenly he felt his mind go blank.*

*Why was he just horrified? Was it something to do with his wet hand? What did he --*

*And suddenly he cried out in pain as his mind attempted to reconcile the newly formed gap in his memory. He was -- important. He was... powerful? But how? What did he do? What did he ever do?*

*Tom slowly and softly collapsed onto the floor of Dumbledore's office, cradling his head as he tried and failed to remember who he was.*

------

**Note:** Frankly I'm embarrassed it came to this. How could there have been an entire society living under our noses for the past several millennia? Credit where it's due, I suppose -- they managed to keep their secret from us for a very long time. And now if our children ask us if magic is real, we can honestly tell them that it used to be.

anglesphere,,,"Yes. All that affirmative action and unfairness to whites yet somehow white society still retains the majority of the benefits and advantages. 

&gt;&gt;White nations, Europe and America, are the only nations wherein governments *formally established by Whites* and for what are essentially white ethnicities and peoples, actively seek their own demographic annihilation as well as pinning all social ills on society, on Whites.

Did you ever consider that maybe a culture that can take stock of themselves is doing itself a favor? That it's improving itself?

And despite racial harmony and integration being a difficult problem, did you ever think the culture or multiculture that solves that problem-- unlike your more homogenous examples who don't dare tackle it-- will be stronger for overcoming an obstacle no other culture has overcome? 

I don't know about you, but as a white, straight, male, I don't feel the least bit threatened. 

I don't feel like affirmative action threatens my ability to get a job. I don't feel like my ability to make money is threatened. 

Lastly, it might be helpful to keep in mind that culture is separate from race. You keep alluding to the white race being injured, threatened or considered inherently sick when in fact the issue is cultural. There's nothing wrong whiteness as manifested in race. The problem lies in certain embedded behaviors and attitudes within traditionally labelled white culture that anyone--black, white, asian,etc-- can adopt or reject.

Culture is a program and any culture can have its bugs but you don't have to run that program if you don't want to.

DirtyProjector,,,"I spent 3 months in Europe this summer and it’s ASTONISHING how many times I saw this type of behavior. I was at the “castle” (which actually was just a prison that they call a castle) one day reading in a little park that had a swing on a tree.  It actually became a game for me where every 3 minutes a man and woman would appear. The woman would walk toward the swing, the man would follow. The woman would touch the swing, test that it was safe, and then sit on the swing and perfectly position herself, and the guy would start taking her photo.  Snap after snap, while she posed leaning back, sometimes smiling, or flipping her hair. I think I saw 11 or 12 people do it in less than an hour. 

This was just one example. I saw this shit EVERYWHERE. Bridges, in front of buildings, squares etc.  It’s such narcissistic behavior that’s perpetuated by society.  It’s also interesting because social media seems to encourage it. I would take photos of objects and scenes because they were beautiful.  People would ask if I wanted to be in the photo and I’d decline - why would anyone want to see my mug obstructing the view.  But if you go on Instagram, or Facebook, people would interact as much or more with a photo of a selfie of a friend, or a picture of 2 people in some boring location, than my photo of a gorgeous scene from some remote location.

*Qabbalah* is the international Hermetic dialogue concerning Jewish Kabbalah. Basically a bunch of Hermeticists, and Hermetic alchemists, over  along period of time, adopted Jewish Kabbalah from the Jewish Diaspora (we are very talkative people) and integrated it into the understanding of the Mystery Schools already present and Europe at the time. There was already quite a lot of this intermingling of cosmic theory going on, but it got a huge jumpstart when the influx of Jews came into Europe and met up with the other occult weirdos in Europe. They were all sort of in the same boat, after all - hiding from the evils of the Inquisition.

So which is authentic? Both have their qualities...the Jewish Kabbalah tends to be too focused on religious devotion, while the Hermetic version tends to be too rigid in their views on doctrines that should have been rectified years ago - they didn't have access to Lurianic Kabbalah.

- how unrealistic the ""damage"" each strike does to the main character's opponents (especially the henchmen). A lot of ""one hit kills"" so to speak by tiny 130 pound men. Compare it to Atomic Blond for example, not a great movie from a technical/execution point of vue, but one thing it did very well was that it was VERY good at portraying damage and how a motivated opponent fighting for his life won't just lay down for the hero. 

- Unlimited cardio. Especially Kung Fu movies. That shit is exhausting. An exhausted fighter vs a fresh fighter fight differently. There's no sense of a fighter pacing himself or trying to maximize efficiency and economy of movement. 

- No damage, No pain, No problem. Not just the heroes, but the baddies too if you pay attention. Although this has gotten better over the years, there are still a few wolverine-like teflon heroes out there.

That said, there is an exception and it's name is Jackie ""the OG"" Chan. Although he would sometimes one shot opponents, usually most of JC's opponents would get back up and come back asking for more. Likewise although JC is always a cardio machine in his movies, he does get tired and strives for efficiency later in his prolonged fights. Same for damage. JC gets fucked up in his fights and just keeps coming.

Basically Jackie Chan is the man.

What Warrior is to Bloodsport, I'd also say that **Creed** is to Rocky.

**Haywire**, staring Gina Carano, a former Women's MMA champ, features very technically clean striking and great ground work that's not as over the top as John Wick and Atomic Blond. Of those two, I'd say John Wick features great Judo in particular.

HALdron1988,,,"""United Nations peacekeeping was initially developed during the Cold War as a means of resolving conflicts between states by deploying unarmed or lightly armed military personnel from a number of countries, under UN command, to areas where warring parties were in need of a neutral party to observe the peace process.""

http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/principles.shtml

Not sure what you even arguing with this because it just frames the UN element being a part of Federation and Starfleet? Considering they have a mandate or principle of self defense UN Peacekeeping they clearly are not utterly unarmed and they need permission from the Security Council to do stuff. Problem with UN Peacekeeping is that they can be blocked and undermined and restrained (with times pushed to have them more capable of activities being restrained) by the security council members.

NATO is not the Federation because Federation is the Civilian authority. 

Nato is alliance and Treaty not one solid army that calls itself Nato. Nato has countries with it own armed forces but Starfleet is one army that people can join like the UN Peacekeeper troops if it was a UN army. Starfleet structure was likely drawn on from his experience in the US Air Corps. So it is more accurate to say Starfleet is more American Military.  Obviously Rodenberry is American so you could say it America on grander scale or was in his mind but it is still like the UN and EU as well. 

So Federation is separate to Starfleet and if you must keep the American self centered it separation of power but that was not created by America that concept. Nor is the American Dream and the idea of immigrants making a new life something Americans came up with. Sweden has taken far more refugees and immigrants then a lot of places and given them a chance. That isnt because of America. 

The Federation is UN and EU working and yes has US elements and democracy elements. Yet you say that the UN has founding elements from the US. Not all the founding elements are unique to just the US but this is  not incorrect to say. Yet this further frames that UN having similarities to the US means it being said the Federation are like the UN is also correct. The EU, UN and US are all elements in the Federation.  Starfleet separate to them is far more American Army in structure but not in substance because it was a myriad of civilizations from multiple worlds joining together not just America and the whole of Earth united. You say that because America has all these cultures it is why it is America and I already know how US was formed. But the point with Starfleet and Federation is that they do not erase your civilizations ideologies and turn you into them. They accept civilizations and ideologies of other civilizations. So to say all the culture of the Federation is just America is not correct because they constantly talk about different members of Federation (other alien civilizations) poets and philosophers etc. So in turn this would not turn it  just into western or human civilization. What you say is that they are all just Western Civilization when it aint because everyone, all these different races civilizations are still respected. It isnt colonialism that assimilates. Federation is far more about consenting to sharing then forcing it and replacing it.  

Federation Flag looks like UN and EU Flag -- and you can say America too with the stars. The Federation and Starfleet are separate with one being military but they all have elements of US, UN and EU and general democracy and human civilization not just America. Federation then having many planets in it means a sharing of culture like how characters have liked specific Klingons or whoever works. So no it isnt just Western Civilization.

fast_edi,,,"The Spanish constitution can be amended. If you have certain majority in government and you follow the democratic standards at this point, there is a way to do that.

If my memory is not wrong (I am not sure 100%) the Spanish Constitutional Court have said that a referendum about any political thing can be asked, because in Spain referendums are not binding legally, except for ammending the constitution and autonomous estatutes. Politically is very difficult to disobey what has been decided in referendum, but there is not a legal connection. So, you could ask and then you need a plan after the result.

In any case. What is happening now IS NOT, a democratic referendum. First of all, because rule of law and respect if civil rights is a must. Here we have a regional government that is clearly and frontally against the constitution that legitimate its existence. I, as a citizen, have the right to expect that public power obey the laws.

Second, this referendum lacks the most basic warranties that ensure a fair voting process and result. It doesn't fit in the international standards, of the Quebec or Scotland process, and also the European Council, with the Venice convention, that, for example says that the question should be approved with enough time. Here the voting was approved on September the 6th, to vote on October the 1st. Less time than the regular one for any election in Spain. The Venice convention talks about a year. It also lacks a fair composition of the people who is going to control the vote, what it is going to be a volunteer recruitment. There is no regular census to check your voting status. There is not a independent executive power that controls the process (the regular elections have a independent administration leaded by judges and civil servants). And so on...

They never bothered to keep any democratic aparences. They just say ""democracy means to vote"" so it doesn't matter how a reach that points. The goal justifies the means. But they are stepping in my rights as citizen. I expect the public powers to obey the courts resolutions. Otherwise this is a revolt, not a democracy. The parties that voted in parliament to do the referendum don't even represent more than 50% of the catalan people that voted in the last elections. This is a joke.

It's already happening all over Europe. American whites have lower birth rates than blacks and hispanics. Perhaps ""replaced"" was the appropriate term to use.

We're focusing on ethnicities right now Einstein. American whites have very high suicide rates compared to blacks and hispanics. Unfortunately Asians also have high rates.

Overpopulation by itself isnt destroying the planet. It's the carbon emissions and overall consumption per capita. In that case, you can't even compare the consumption of blacks and hispanics to whites. Whites in developed countries are doing the real damage here.

I made no assertion, merely stated the obvious contradiction of his statement therefore its impossible for my post to be wrong (except on calling him a shill but thats more insult than accusation).

&gt;The goal is to destroy every country on earth, including Israel. You're both obviously not familiar with Israeli politics. Netanyahu and Soros have been at war for a two decades.  

I'll admit I dont follow Israeli politics but do you have any proof for this theory of yours? The bit of theory i know of is the greater yinon plan which would expand israel, allowing it to conquer parts of the middle east which evacuate to and fight with europe. That plan alone is more reasonable than destruction of all nations since outside of white countries you dont have ethnic suicide anywhere. China will not cease to be a country for centuries to come. Neither will japan. How will they get asians to commit ethnic suicide via replacement when they cant even convince china to let non chinese own property?

&gt;They're using the Muslims in Sweden to act antisemitic and kill jews 

Who is they? The globalists? The swedish neo nazis marching in the article? Soros and friends as they try to destroy the concept of a nation? Be clear.

As for muslims committing crime thats just islam as its been since its founding. Even Muhammad himself raided jewish merchants for profit and its that profit which garnered his initial islamic followers. Muslims have been fighting jews quite literally since islam came into being. Muslims following their holy books and killing the non believers is what the quran preaches, not what anyone else commands them to do. 

If you meant the swedes in the article then you dont need islam to foster their hatred for jews, you only need to realize what it is that they peddle to your nation. Communism is a bolshevik jewish invention that killed over a hundred million. The media we both hate so much is owned by jews who, as you yourself claim, are purposefully deceitful to divide the people of a nation. A lot of the writers and tv anchors for the media and entertainment are jewish as well. These jewish agents then promote multiculturalism and try to bury the mass rapes and terrorism it brings with it. The modern idea of gender is also the failed jewish invention of Dr. Money. The most well recognized man haters in 2nd and 3rd wave feminism are overwhelmingly jewish. The frankfurt school and cultural marxism is also a jewish invention. Degenerate hollywood films that serve as leftist propaganda is a jewish monopoly. Pornography is an immensely jewish medium when it comes to professional producers of it. Even the very muslims you claim hate jews so much are part of the plan, see barbara spectre's admission of how jews will be at the center of turning europe into a multicultural hellhole. They did the same in the US; Jewish groups like the ADL and American Jewish Congress were influential in changing the demographics of the US prior to and following the passing of the 1965 immigration act which was written by norbert schlei, who as luck would have it is a jew.  Everywhere you look, almost every single fucking time, its a jew behind the push for degeneracy and degradation of the nation. 

People on this sub deride globalism but refuse to mention how involved jews are with its promulgation. It is no different today than during hitler's speeches when he referred to these globalists jews as ""the members of a rootless, international clique."" Even if not a single muslim existed in europe, so long as jews push filth and decay on a nation they will rightfully earn themselves nothing but condemnation and hatred. Any country would be completely justified to hate a foreign influence of that scale and magnitude. 

&gt;so the controlled media can exclude the race and religion of the attackers and pretend they're Christian white swedes. 

The media does this for any minority group though, not just muslims. Even then people are realizing this is the case, sweden has had an upswing with public opinion turning against immigration as of late.

&gt;They did it both to pressure jews and whites. Don't be dense. The media in the US does this shit all the time, you should be able to recognize this stuff by now.  

Pressure is good, we need change in the world. Yeah, what a surprise that jewish media pits one against the other using the tenents of the jewish constructed critical theory. I'm shocked.

&gt;But yeah, that guy you're talking to is a shill because he's not an irrational mouthbreathing Jew-hating retard like you. Sure, dude.   

Even if hes not a shill, the rest of my post holds true, his claim is contradictory and his conclusion is therefore retarded. There is nothing irrational about hating the people responsible for the very corruption of your nation and contrary to what you may believe I dont hate the average jew which has nothing to do with shitting up the west. Send them back to their homeland in israel since they dont dare shit up that home of theirs with the cancers they readily promote and invite to the west. May they live peacefully in Israel where their influence cannot destroy nations. Like trump himself said, if you cannot even name the problem you cannot begin to fix it.

ramalamasnackbag,,,"Thanks for posting this. One of the things that makes it hard to talk about having been in a cult is that cult members and ex-cult members are so stereotyped. Only weak people join cults, only stupid people join cults, etc. I ran across this quote from a cult researcher and it really hit home to me: ""No one joins a cult, they just delay leaving.""

I was in a cult for more than a decade. I had NO IDEA that it was a cult until shortly before I left. This was in part because, as you say, the media has people thinking that a cult means they don't let you leave, or that a cult means that a charismatic leader controls your personal life. Reading about cults described as ""high-demand groups"" really opened my eyes. 

For example, in the cult that I was in, there was no written rule that you couldn't stay friends with people who leave the cult. But the social pressure to not remain friends with people who leave is huge. The cult had a LOT of written rules, but the unwritten rules were much more influential and more strongly enforced by the leaders. 

I don't think ""my"" cult always was a cult. It didn't seem like a cult when I joined, and maybe it wasn't culty then. But maybe I was just naive (I was very young.) 

Ironically, I have always found cults and related subcultures fascinating. I had no expectation that I would find myself in one. When I realized I was in a cult, I left. But in the process of leaving I lost a lot of friends and the knowledge that I had been in a cult really hurt my self-esteem.

This is how Hitler gained power in Germany. In fact, it's fairly much exactly how he gained power if you go back and read the history of his rise. 


My proposal to the government right now to stop this violent movement in it's tracks are several measures. 


First off, remove any and all protections against public officials for any actions they may take that patronize these organizations. 


It needs to be a federal crime to protect these violent groups in any way. 


Calling for a police stand down when there is a violent protest against free speech, should be a federal crime against any official who does so. 

Failure to protect peaceful rallies, and it's participants, needs to be a federal crime. 


Anyone who gets attacked and injured by these groups, should be able to sue for damages. 


Covering the face in any way to prevent identification during a protest of any kind whether it be an organized and permitted protest or not permitted, should be a federal crime. It's a clear signal that the person doing so intends and had planned to commit a crime when they attempt to hide their identity. 


Infiltrating a rally event to protest and disrupt such an event needs to be prosecuted as a trespass and disorderly conduct. Standard procedure. It's not your rally so you have no right to even be there. 


Blocking a road, highway, freeway, interstate freeway, intentionally, should be a federal crime. Blocking or attempting to block people from entering a public building to participate in a political event, especially an election or political rally, should be a federal crime.

dart200,,let's not go extinct ~ /r/SLS,"&gt; It's already happening all over Europe.

not really.

&gt; American whites have lower birth rates than blacks and hispanics. Perhaps ""replaced"" was the appropriate term to use.

i mean. birth rates have been dropping across the board, becoming more similar, not different:

    year hispanic white black
    1990 26.7     14.4  23.0
    2015 16.3     10.7  14.2

it won't be long until those are basically the same

white people aren't about to be 'replaced'

&gt; We're focusing on ethnicities right now Einstein.

... man you are a fucking idiot aren't you?

those are other countries, full of people with totally different ethnicities than white, killing themselves at rates far beyond the american average.

&gt; American whites have very high suicide rates compared to blacks and hispanics. 

now american whites are 77% of the country, so they dominate that american figure by far, they still wouldn't be top of list.

&gt; Unfortunately Asians also have high rates.

maybe because it has nothing to do with someone being 'white', ya dingus. probably has to do with skin color affecting temperament, but the gradient is just lighter vs darker, irrespective of whatever the historical races are.

&gt;  If you don't care, then that plays in our favor.

how does that play in your favor and not mine? i'm a human. you're a human. the ratio of skin colors changes, so what? why are you so insistent on framing this as race vs race? ... like a racist, you fucking moron. lol. 

&gt; Overpopulation by itself isnt destroying the planet

lol. yeah, but now all the population wants to consume like america does. and they certainly are trying to so do. if you can't see the problem here you are a fucking idiot.

&gt; No, I just understand all the damage you've brought to this planet and doomed us all in the process. Of course I would feel this way. You're the worst thing to ever happen to humanity. 

oh? you think other races wouldn't have done this? you ignore the fact that china now produces twice the total emissions as the US? or india which produces almost as much as the EU? regardless of population, you think *that's* sustainable? 

or did you ever take a look at the carbon emissions of like saudi arabia and UAE? because they are actually higher per capitas than the US. those people aren't white.

a) as i said, any other society would have done the same given the technological development. as we now see the rest of the world trying to do.

b) if you're looking to blame someone, it doesn't matter. if humanity doesn't get it's shit together, regardless of race, we're all fucked, regardless of race.

No. I'm... very probably older than you. When newer people come to work where I do, or through social circles something comes up, I do everything I can to give them good leads, and good advice. I want them to succeed. Partly because it's just polite and this is Minnesota; We're not dicks unless we have to be. But mostly because I'm sick of waking up and hearing on the morning commute that Samsung made a phone that self-immolates so often people changed the name of it to the ""Death Note"". Or how some shitty, badly coded 'ransomware' knocked most of Europe for a loop on everything from transportation to hospitals. It gets old waking up to the smell of freshly burnt circuitboards all the time. 


The truth is, it's not just kids getting hurt in my industry. Society as a whole is. Our engineering practices are utter shit. Everything is a black box. People are sued for trying to get things to work together. If the IT industry were a playground, it would be a shit show of kids throwing and kicking sand at each other, screaming, stomping the fingers of the younger kids who try to climb up on things, and no adults for miles in every direction. Nobody plays nice in this field. There are no rules. There are no laws except the ones corporations write. 


We chew up young adults and spit them back out. What makes us unique is that people actually buy that shit like Zuckerberg saying ""Young people are just smarter."" I know, mentioning it here, some fucktard is going to read that and say ""HEY!"" and mash the down vote because he thinks he *actually is*. That's how much koolaid gets drunk in tech. Our phones catch fire, and it's just ""a manufacturing defect"". Windows crashes and eats three hours of work? Well, that happens sometimes. People have acclimated to the bullshit -- they don't even see it. It's like these videos where someone gets run over in an intersection and all the other drivers just drive *around* the guy unconscious in a pool of blood. 


People see what they want to see. All those drivers see themselves being late returning from lunch, and so they just drive on by, thinking to themselves ""I'm sure someone else has called 911 already."" Just like the next driver. And the next. And the next. Every now and then something goes wrong enough to get noticed even through the ""Somebody-Else's-Problem"" cloaking field -- and then these tech giants, these darlings of the economy, grace Congress with a visit, and they're told how great they are, how wonderful, and if they could just answer a few ""brief"" questions... and whatever falls out of their mouth gets a standing applause and on their way they go. Our internet is shit -- but asking companies to fix it is ""hampering innovation."" Everything is on fire, but it would be ""bad for the economy"" to have regulations requiring things be fire-resistant. It's an endless fucking circlejerk. A FIFO buffer of suck. 


The only reason it continues is because people think that's the price to pay for us to have nice things.

pizzashill,,,"Lmao, Commies allowed Hitler to take power:

&gt; The myth of the Fascist coup in Italy also misled the German Left, and helped assure the fatal passivity of the German Socialist Party (SPD) and the German Communist Party (KPD) in late 1932 and early 1933.

&gt; Both expected the Nazis to attempt a coup, though their analyses of the situation were otherwise totally different. For the SPD, the expected Nazi uprising would be their signal to act without bearing the onus of illegality, as they had successfully done with a general strike against the “Kapp Putsch” of 1920, when Freikorps units had tried to take over the government. Given that frame of mind, they never identified an opportune moment for counteraction against Hitler.

&gt; The nearest thing to a putsch in Weimar Germany in the early 1930s came not from the Nazis but from their conservative predecessor, Chancellor Franz von Papen. On July 20, 1932, von Papen deposed the legitimately elected government of the state (Land) of Prussia, a coalition of socialists and the Catholic Center Party, and prevailed upon President Hindenburg to use his emergency powers to install a new state administration headed by von Papen. That act might legitimately have triggered strong counteraction from the Left. The SPD leaders, however, deterred by strong legalitarian convictions, advancing age,11 the futility of the strike weapon during mass unemployment, and perhaps legitimate fears that action by the Left might perversely throw even more middle-class Germans into the arms of the Nazis, limited their response to a futile lawsuit against Chancellor von Papen. Having failed to offer effective opposition to von Papen’s illegal action in July 1932, the socialists—still the second largest party in Germany—had even less occasion to act against Hitler, who avoided any direct assault on legality until he was already in unshak-able control in spring 1933.12

&gt; The communists followed a totally different logic, based upon their conviction that social revolution was at hand. In that perspective, Nazi success might actually help the communist cause by setting off a pen-dulum movement, first to the Right and then, inexorably, to the Left.

&gt; KPD strategists, focused firmly on the coming revolution, saw SPD efforts to save Weimar democracy as “objectively” counterrevolutionary. They denounced the socialists as “social fascists.” Convinced that the SPD was no less their enemy than the Nazis and competing with the Nazis for the same volatile membership (especially the unemployed), the KPD even cooperated with the Nazis in a wildcat strike against the Berlin transport system in November 1932. The last thing the German communists were going to do was help the SPD save democratic institutions.13


If you're a liberal and you support commies - I've got news for you, liberals are every bit as bad as nazis in their eyes.

Hell, Stalin was even funneling supplies to Germany because he was so delusional:

&gt; For all its multinational trimmings, therefore, ‘Operation Barbarossa’ was thus in essence to be a German operation. As the winter snows of East-Central Europe melted and the ground thawed, the German armed forces began moving vast masses of men and equipment up to the Soviet border. Throughout May and early June 1941, Zygmunt Klukowski recorded endless columns of German troops and vehicles passing through his region of Poland, noting the passage of between 500 and 600 vehicles on 14 June alone, for example.139 Stalin hurriedly launched a futile policy of trying to appease the Germans by stepping up Soviet deliveries of Asian rubber and other supplies under the trade agreement signed in January 1941. As a dogmatic Marxist-Leninist, Stalin was convinced that Hitler’s regime was the tool of German monopoly capitalism, so that if he made available everything German business wanted, there would be no immediate reason to invade. Already, under trade provisions agreed under the Nazi-Soviet Pact early the previous year, the Soviet Union was supplying nearly three-quarters of Germany’s requirement of phosphates, over two-thirds of its imported asbestos, only a little less of its chrome ore, over half its manganese, over a third of its imported nickel, and, even more crucially, more than a third of its imported oil.140 Stalin personally vetoed proposals to disrupt the German military build-up by attacking across the Polish demarcation line. Reports from Soviet agents and even from members of the German embassy in Moscow that an invasion was imminent only convinced him that the Germans were playing hard-ball in their drive to extract economic concessions from him.


&gt; At the same time, Stalin realized that, as he told graduating military cadets in Moscow on 5 May 1941, ‘War with Germany is inevitable.’ Molotov might be able to postpone it for two or three months, but in the meantime it was vital to ‘re-teach our army and our commanders. Educate them in the spirit of attack.’142 Delivered to young officers as a rhetorical message for the future, this was not a statement of intent. Stalin did not believe that the Red Army would be ready to deal with the Germans until 1942 or perhaps even 1943. Not only had the General Staff not drawn up any plans for an attack on the German forces, it had no plans for a defence against them either.143 Although the Germans mounted a large and sophisticated deception plan to conceal the true nature of their intentions, Soviet intelligence began to send in accurate reports that the invasion was planned for around 22 June 1941. But Stalin would not listen. Earlier reports that the invasion plans were to become operational on 15 May 1941, though correct at the time, proved wrong when the Germans delayed Barbarossa in order to mount the invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia. Hitler later blamed Mussolini for the consequences, but in fact the weather in East-Central Europe in these weeks would have made an invasion of the Soviet Union inadvisable even had the German Leader not been obliged to step in to rescue his Italian ally from the imbroglio in Southern Europe. The Soviet agents who had made the prediction lost all credibility as a result.144 The capitalist forces in Britain, including the exiled Polish government, seemed to Stalin’s narrow and suspicious mind to be feeding false information to him about German intentions in order to lure him into a battle. Surely in any case the German Leader would not invade while the conflict with Britain was still unresolved. When an ex-Communist soldier deserted the German forces on 21 June 1941 and swam across a river to tell the Russians on the other side that his unit had been given orders to invade the following morning, Stalin had him shot for spreading ‘disinformation’.145

When someone living here as a national gets arrested, they have the right to a lawyer but not to a government official and they likely won't need a translator.

This is normal, par or the course. In a treaty between two nations or nation groups, they protect the rights of their own abroad. That is granted reciprocally. These rights are typically rights that only people living abroad need (interpreter) or that only makes sense for people living abroad (your embassy? At home?). This is normal, already exists for other countries and simply a necessity. And you can also benefit from those rights, simply move abroad. 

As for why the ECJ? Necessity. At the pace the negotiations are going, it's not likely a neutral arbitration court can be established.

citizenjack,nimble,Non-Trump Supporter,"Russia has no allies on the world stage.  I don't think you understand the fragile position Russia's poor economy puts them in as well.  They are a petrol state.  Their economy relies on exports of oil and gas and if any sort of conflict were to break out, their economy would be immediately destroyed as soon it begins.  The security council seat counts for something.  However, if they were to use their position, they risk backlash from the EU, which could pretty easily damage the Russian economy by just slowing Russian imports.  Their nuclear weapons guarantee them the ability to act regionally, but the actual use of nuclear weapons would result in the obliteration of Russia as well.  There wouldn't be a Russia around to claim victory afterwards.  This is mutually assured destruction and it doesn't give them massive leverage for acting globally, instead it only assures their continued survival as a state.

Their economy is stagnant, their population is shrinking, they have rampant crises at home, including health and human rights.  They're a scary bear, but when they're prodded they don't respond.  Turkey, a NATO member, shot down a Russian warplane.  Putin said there would be serious consequences for the country, but there never were any repercussions.  Militarily, economically or otherwise.  Russia realizes their precarious position on the world stage, as a result they are largely unable to act in a serious way.

Their space program is largely built on old Soviet technology and is capable of manned spaceflight, but has not advanced far beyond that. 71 countries actually have space programs.  Many of those operate satellites.  16 have launch capabilities with many more expected to soon.  [Here are the current capabilities for manned spaceflight](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Human_spaceflight.svg#Legend) The Soviets had lunar soft landing capability, but Russia does not.  Although Russia is one of 3 countries capable of launching men into space, you can see how the rest of the world is progressing on that front.

Space is a good example for Russia as a whole.  They have capabilities in certain areas, but they do not make significant progress.  As Russia stagnates, the rest of the world catches up and rushes ahead.  Their economy is too fragile to attract investment, their lack of allies prevents them from extending their reach, their abysmal conditions at home means they are capable of ramping up their economy in a meaningful way.  They are powerful country, but they do not progress with the rest of the world.  They bark loud, but have little bite.

the_vizir,,MOD || Horror Shop--Where Every Day Is Halloween,"I had *dozens* of worlds before Horror Shop... some of the more notable include:

**Vault:** A space Western science fantasy wherein a powerful, human-run empire is in conflict with various rebel factions over the control of powerful, alien vaults scattered across the galaxy. Basically a straight ripoff of Wildstar and Borderlands, with a lot of alien weirdness caused by super-advanced magitech, gratuitous desert planets, and too many animal-people races. 

**Terra Nova:** A superhero world that was a bad ripoff of the early Marvel Cinematic universe. Mostly focused on the adventures of a political aide who developed mind reading powers and uncovered a sinister government conspiracy, a stage magician who discovered she possessed real magical powers, a grim gunslinger with superhuman aiming skills, and a pair of twins with light and darkness based powers and their overprotective dad who build a mech suit to protect them, 

**Cirundi:** An alt-modern world that charted the development of a non-human species known as the syth from their stone age through to their equivalent of our modern era. Included things like geopolitics, religions, the cultural legacy of ancient empires, shipping langes, lingua francas, and all sorts of boring nitty-gritty that a political science student would love.

**Orone:** A steampunk city floating in an endless sky, connected to a thousand worlds through portals, gates, and rifts. Basically my attempt to recreate Planescape--only without the weirdness and conceptual mind-blowingness of the outer planes. 

**Evenstar:** A sci-fi universe where humanity had recently fought off the regional empire and broken their hold--leading to the rise of a dozen petty, squabbling stellar nations, the ascendant Terran Dominion, and the collapsing Elder Empire all fighting for control. Inspired by Mass Effect, Firefly, and Andromeda. 

**Caelea:** A steampunk world set on what amounted to an obviously mirrored Europe--but this was on purpose! See, the whole thing was supposed to be a pre-WWI Europe and feature the various nations and factions rushing towards an inevitable war. Largely inspired by real-world history, as well as classic high fantasy--and a lot of steampunk art. 

**Newumberland:** A Gothinc horror/colonial Gothic world, based on good ol' ghost stories and folktales of the New World--with a heaping helping of Ravenloft on the side. Centred around the nation of Newumberland, basically an alternate New England, complete with witch-trials, creepy small towns, and a lot of not!Indian burial grounds. 

**Moons of Migarna:** A fantasy monster hunter universe set on a series of elementally-aligned moons orbiting a gas giant. People got magic by partnering with various monsters, and they stored spells and armour in cards, because I was like 11 at the time and loved Magic and MagiNation. 

For most of these universes, I stopped working on them because I lost interest, or something else caught my attention. I had a really bad case of worldbuilding ADD--I'd invent a world, start planning a grand series of stories/novels/a tabletop campaign setting for them, and then lose interest about 100 pages into the actual work to get them to work. The only reason Horror Shop didn't go the same way is I had a few other people working with me on the project, giving me a sense of responsibility and preventing me from running off and starting up some new project--which, truth be told, I actually did, as I spent like 8 months working on Vault before I realized my work on that setting was preventing me from focusing as much as I should on Horror Shop. 

But this focus did pay off--I am now two-dozen strips into a webcomic for Horror Shop, have attended conventions showing off my work, and am about 200 pages into a novel for the world. So work is actually happening here! For the first time ever, my worldbuilding is producing actual, tangible materials, instead of dozens of half-finished documents.

InsecureCheesecake,,דתית לאומית,"&gt; It's nearly impossible to wipe out our tribe due to how spread out we are.


All at once maybe (although everyone seems to hold the view that Hitler could have won the war if it wasnt for his stupid attack on Russia and that in that case we didnt stand a chance). But bit by bit, I dont see why not. The populations we lived with certainly didnt lacked the will or the means to ensure so, so how come we and our culture survived them?


I know that we are debating essentially ""why are we still here?"" and that to propose scenarios in which we could easily have disappeared is pure speculation as we didnt, but I think that our survival as a people is too much of a coincidence. You think it's perfectly normal and that there's nothing suspicious there, and I respect your judgement, but I personally think that what you regard (I deduct) as mere coincidence (the Shoah happening in a time ""only"" half of our people was living in Europe, Hitler attacking Russia and thus losing the war, the Church demanding we werent all wiped out to serve them as some sort of proof, the creation of the state of Israel, to mention some of the main ones) is G-d's work.


(on another note, the Shoah didnt stop to Europe and my own grandmother had to hide in the Bey's properties in Tunisia in order to survive. so not so fine)
(and out of respect for the victims of the Shoah we avoid to even try to come up with an explanation for it and the other persecutions we endured, but there are quite a lot of authors (often themselves survivors) which while they dont provide explanations propose reflexions on it.

Jaohni,,,"So, there's a few explanations here. Firstly, geography. Look at Russia. It's fucking huge. The Russian server is hosted in Sweden, I believe. At that point, your ping from Russia to Sweden (which is also the ping for Russian server), and your ping for EU East and even West are pretty much the same. This means anyone who set their region to automatic will probably end up in EU at some point, and any who looked at their ping once and then set it could queue in EU consistently. That said, some Russians end up in Japan as well, or even US West. It's kind of a crapshoot.

Secondly, a lot of Russians probably speak the odd word of English, and think ""well, I guess I can use this as my second language"" and since a lot of people (particularly people from Germanic countries like Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands), in the EU servers have very good English, they put that as their second language, so the server system probably pairs those groups together.

Finally, I dunno. Maybe they're trolling.

If it makes you feel better, I live in Western Canada, and my winrate in US East is like ~10% worse in US East, because we have tons of people from Peru there, who are kind of like our Russians, for more or less the reasons I listed above (although obviously their server isn't hosted in Sweden)

And also, not quite on topic, but if you're annoyed by Russians, then remember that you can learn to adapt to the Russian meta, and win games stupidly easy, if you just dive with them when they come to your lane, and play aggressively with your team.

“In 1943, some 3 million brown-skinned subjects of the Raj died in the Bengal famine, one of history's worst. Mukerjee delves into official documents and oral accounts of survivors to paint a horrifying portrait of how Churchill, as part of the Western war effort, ordered the diversion of food from starving Indians to already well-supplied British soldiers and stockpiles in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, including Greece and Yugoslavia. And he did so with a churlishness that cannot be excused on grounds of policy: Churchill's only response to a telegram from the government in Delhi about people perishing in the famine was to ask why Gandhi hadn't died yet.

British imperialism had long justified itself with the pretense that it was conducted for the benefit of the governed. Churchill's conduct in the summer and fall of 1943 gave the lie to this myth. ""I hate Indians,"" he told the Secretary of State for India, Leopold Amery. ""They are a beastly people with a beastly religion."" The famine was their own fault, he declared at a war-cabinet meeting, for ""breeding like rabbits.""

As Mukerjee's accounts demonstrate, some of India's grain was also exported to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to meet needs there, even though the island wasn't experiencing the same hardship; Australian wheat sailed past Indian cities (where the bodies of those who had died of starvation littered the streets) to depots in the Mediterranean and the Balkans; and offers of American and Canadian food aid were turned down. India was not permitted to use its own sterling reserves, or indeed its own ships, to import food. And because the British government paid inflated prices in the open market to ensure supplies, grain became unaffordable for ordinary Indians. Lord Wavell, appointed Viceroy of India that fateful year, considered the Churchill government's attitude to India ""negligent, hostile and contemptuous.""”

Joint Strategic Defense Force is an International, NATO led, EU based, Tactical Fighting Unit able to respond in conventional warfare and asymmetric conflicts.

The unit mainly plays custom made co-operative missions against AI/Zeus; we have taken part successfully in large TvT joint campaigns and occasionally have internal PvP game sessions.

Operations are Saturday's 19.30 UTC, with mini-ops/training Sunday and Wednesday 19.00 UTC.

Members also have access to our 'Hearts &amp; Minds' persistent co-op mission server 24/7.

As a new member you will be able to join in any infantry squad role other than Leader. Specialist roles, including Transport/Armour/Recon and CAS are opened after a short requisite training.

The Unit hopes members will bring plenty of personality but leave ego behind and embrace a co-operative environment where team success out weighs individual glory. To this end there is a rank structure and in operations, orders from NCO's, Squad Leads and HQ staff should be respected; but we forego using Sir or rank titles when addressing each other.

Lahfinger,,,"Personalmente mi ritengo una persona tranquilla e mite, ma gli indipendentisti catalani - tutti, ma proprio t u t t i quelli con cui ho avuto a che fare, sia nella vita reale che in quella virtuale - erano dei preoccupanti esaltati e mi diverto ad andare in giro su r/europe a trollarli un po' visto che anche solo riferirsi a Barcellona come ""città spagnola"" è sufficiente per farli andare su tutte le furie. Ma io non vivo in Catalogna e credo che vivendo lì avrei anche accesso alla parte più moderata dell'indipendentismo, quella composta dalla gente qualsiasi della classe media, che magari è anche la parte maggioritaria, non so.

A parte questo, che volendo è un comportamento un po' bambinesco.

La Catalogna, dopo la fine del franchismo, ha sempre chiesto alla Spagna di poter godere di ampia autonomia e di riconoscimento della propria identità. Un primo step è arrivato con l'approvazione plebiscitaria della prima costituzione democratica del 1978; negli anni successivi, in conseguenza anche del problema basco, la Spagna è andata sempre più trasformandosi in uno degli stati più decentralizzati d'Europa, fino a diventare una sorta di quasi-federazione in cui le comunità locali hanno vasti poteri in settori come sanità, istruzione, cultura, trasporti, e possono persino emettere i propri titoli di debito. 

Il governo catalano ne ha quindi approfittato per ""valorizzare"" l'identità locale, finendo per farsi prendere la mano; oggi in Catalogna, nelle scuole e credo anche nelle università, tutte le lezioni si tengono (almeno sulla carta) solo in catalano, eccetto quelle di lingua spagnola, nonostante la maggioranza della popolazione abbia lo spagnolo come prima lingua e comunque più o meno tutti siano bilingui. D'altro canto alcuni esponenti del governo centrale non hanno mancato di fare dichiarazioni imbarazzanti sulla necessità di ""spagnolizzare"" la Catalogna.

Comunque grazie all'autonomia l'indipendentismo catalano è rimasto molto sopito fino alla crisi economica del 2008, quando è scoppiata la bolla immobiliare spagnola e ci si è anche resi conto che la Generalitat catalana era indebitata fino al collo, arrivando a dover chiedere finanziamenti al governo centrale negli anni successivi. Qui è esplosa la questione del ""residuo fiscale"": la Catalogna è una regione più ricca della media spagnola (la quarta dopo Madrid, Paese Basco e Navarra) ed invia al governo centrale alcuni miliardi di euro in più di quelli che riceve - almeno a detta del governo catalano, ma anche secondo alcuni calcoli ufficiali, anche se si varia sulle singole cifre. Questo è stata la prima causa della crescita attuale dell'indipendentismo, causa che è stata pompata alla grandissima dal governo catalano nel tentativo di insabbiare i mille scandali di corruzione che lo piagavano, nonché l'allegra gestione delle finanze pubbliche di cui sopra. Lo slogan principale in questo periodo era ""Espanya ens roba"" (La Spagna ci deruba), assieme a riferimenti a quei pigri andalusi che non lavorano e si costruiscono gli aeroporti in mezzo al nulla col sudore dei seri e composti catalani, o quei selvaggi aragonesi che uccidono i tori per strada.

In questo contesto la corte costituzionale spagnola fa l'errore, se così si può dire, di invalidare alcuni articoli chiave del nuovo statuto d'autonomia catalano che era stato approvato a grande maggioranza sia dal governo centrale che in Catalogna nel 2006. Il tutto avvenne nel quadro di una campagna anti-catalana nella Spagna intera, che riteneva che il nuovo statuto d'autonomia fosse eccessivamente benevolo e costituisse praticamente il prodromo di una secessione. Si arrivò addirittura ad un boicottaggio dei prodotti catalani.

Da lì i toni si sono alzati sempre di più, gli indipendentisti hanno iniziato a fare sempre più casino e si è arrivati a questo punto. 

Quello che a me personalmente dà fastidio non è la richiesta d'indipendenza in sé, ma che gli indipendentisti si siano *realmente* bevuti la narrativa del governo catalano che li descrive come un pacifico, inclusivo e amichevole popolo oppresso da un governo tirannico e provinciale che soffoca la loro cultura e le loro aspirazioni europeiste, senza contare che il problema del residuo fiscale non c'entra assolutamente niente con la richiesta d'indipendentismo, proprio no! Ma soprattutto che, essendo per l'appunto oppressi, riceveranno il massimo supporto da tutti gli attori internazionali potenzialmente coinvolti nella questione, il che significa che nel caso di una dichiarazione unilaterale d'indipendenza non solo verranno immediatamente riconosciuti da tutti ma rimarranno anche nell'UE, e poi gli investitori si precipiteranno in Catalogna in virtù della sua incredibile ricchezza ed industrializzazione e latte e miele pioveranno sulle strade di Barcellona.

C'è da dire che oggi si è arrivati ad un punto tale per cui effettivamente la questione economica è andata in secondo piano. Molti indipendentisti hanno esplicitamente detto che non ha rilevanza se la Catalogna entrerà in grave crisi, perché staccarsi dalla Spagna è più importante.

Detto questo spero che la facciano, una dichiarazione unilaterale. Aziende come Sabadell o Planeta hanno già annunciato, nel caso, piani di emergenza e possibili spostamenti di sede.

Anyway, here's one source, you can very easily find other sources for the same. Shashi Tharoor, the author of this piece, makes a very logical claim for the ill-effects of colonialism which are regularly whitewashed by the British. ([Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CW7S0zxv4) is a famous Oxford Union video of his which went viral).

https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2031992,00.html

&gt; In 1943, some 3 million brown-skinned subjects of the Raj died in the Bengal famine, one of history's worst. Mukerjee delves into official documents and oral accounts of survivors to paint a horrifying portrait of how Churchill, as part of the Western war effort, ordered the diversion of food from starving Indians to already well-supplied British soldiers and stockpiles in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, including Greece and Yugoslavia. And he did so with a churlishness that cannot be excused on grounds of policy: Churchill's only response to a telegram from the government in Delhi about people perishing in the famine was to ask why Gandhi hadn't died yet.

&gt; British imperialism had long justified itself with the pretense that it was conducted for the benefit of the governed. Churchill's conduct in the summer and fall of 1943 gave the lie to this myth. ""I hate Indians,"" he told the Secretary of State for India, Leopold Amery. ""They are a beastly people with a beastly religion."" The famine was their own fault, he declared at a war-cabinet meeting, for ""breeding like rabbits.""

&gt; As Mukerjee's accounts demonstrate, some of India's grain was also exported to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to meet needs there, even though the island wasn't experiencing the same hardship; Australian wheat sailed past Indian cities (where the bodies of those who had died of starvation littered the streets) to depots in the Mediterranean and the Balkans; and offers of American and Canadian food aid were turned down. India was not permitted to use its own sterling reserves, or indeed its own ships, to import food. And because the British government paid inflated prices in the open market to ensure supplies, grain became unaffordable for ordinary Indians. Lord Wavell, appointed Viceroy of India that fateful year, considered the Churchill government's attitude to India ""negligent, hostile and contemptuous.""

It was a genocide, and it should be judged in the same way as the Western World treats Holodomor.

Some people choose to absolve Churchill of his role in the famine by pushing the blame onto his nutter friend Frederick Lindemann, but ultimately Churchill's rabid racism made it far easier for him to rationalise those anti-Indian decisions with led to the death of millions of people.

isaactalks,jezza3,,"Anyone else watching this go down and expecting to see the same thing happen in the UK next election, or here in 2020 if a real leftist is the nominee?

This violence is so blatantly about maintaining the present economic order. Barcelona is a huge monetary boon for Spain – losing it with Catalonia would force big changes in the country. These spurts of desperate violence are the true face of the neoliberal order. If the people won't roll over and accept the present rigid order forever, they must be brought to heel (to borrow a phrase). And Spain is only, as my Spaniard/Cuban grandfather used to wryly put it, the ass of Europe. It's poorer than the rest of the continent, who look down on them with a touch of that old world racism. The economic wellbeing of Spain is fairly low on the list of neoliberalism's priorities. Just imagine what it might look like if this kind of groundshaking change had a shot at upending power in America. Trump might try and cancel the election, maybe even try to woo the centrist liberals against an American Allende by claiming that the commie Bernie (or whoever) is the true Russian Agent. How many of them would finally say ""Today is the day Trump became president"" and go along with him? ""Mr. President, this was never about you, it was about RUSSIA. Welcome to the #Resistance."" I know I can think of at least a few.

Fortunately, there's hope, I think. If I remember my Hannah Arendt correctly from college (not a perfect thinker but her stuff on power is really good IMO), she was of the opinion that this is what the last gasp of power looks like. If you watch these Barcelona videos, the cops seem to be in total chaos, Clockwork Oranging civilians without any goal or purpose besides terror. Haphazard state violence like this is a sign of a crumbling power structure, not a solid one. They can win a battle with these tactics, maybe even quash this referendum, but it will be an albatross around their necks next time.

Taure,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;Germany pulled ahead of Britain around 1900, which lead to WWI, where Germany suffered through 4 years of economic blockade, millions killed in war, significant territorial losses while UK lost some volunteers from mainland, and a whole lot more from its colonies but Germany still pulled ahead following the Versailles that was supposed to further damage its economy. Germany suffered huge losses during WWII, lost much of its territory but again pulled ahead of UK economically.

Crusader1089,,,"&gt;be plenty of support for staying in the EU

Ha. Ha ha. People's opinions aren't changing, they're hardening. Theresa May's expected successor is Boris Johnson, or another hardline brexiteer who expects to make vast amounts of money bankrupting the nation. Jeremy Corbyn has always been a euroskeptic and wants to leave the EU to turn the UK into a worker's paradise (more power to ya, but I don't think it's gonna work). 

Everyone is floundering for short term political gain. The political elite won't suffer from Brexit. Most of them stand to make a fortune on currency selling, privatisation, manipulating the laws as we leave the EU, or just because they own businesses that thrive on fear and economic destruction. The people who support Brexit are not even aware of how badly this could go wrong. The largest fruit grower in the country is saying that without the EU Britain won't eat. The UK government is sitting on a report about the estimated food price rises because they are afraid it will cause a panic in the economy. 

No one in favour of Brexit is informed about Brexit, because they don't want to be informed. They want to feel powerful, they want to see change. They don't think anything can harm them. They forget that before EU membership the vast majority of UK homes did not have central heating, 30% lacked indoor plumbing, and our electricity supply was so sporadic it was rationed to a three day week. They forget that olive oil was sold in Boots pharmacy, not tesco. 

There is not a single politician who stands to gain from supporting continued EU membership. There is not a single likely future PM who *wants* EU membership. Very few Brexit voters have changed their minds. The only swing in a second referendum in, say 2022, will be that a large number of Brexit voters (about 500,000-1million) will have died of old age. 

If Britain doesn't leave the EU it will be a bloody miracle, or a banker's coup. ",True,0,1506850220,,False,0,dnr0vl9,False,t3_73jhqt,t1_dnr0nc5,/r/technology/comments/73jhqt/when_it_comes_to_political_ads_its_time_for/dnr0vl9/,1509199636,48,False,technology,t5_2qh16,

[deleted],,,"Przyszedł mi na myśl mój ""faworyt"" Oscillococcinum.

&gt;- (...) potrzeba co najmniej kilkunastu miliardów atomów, żeby zabić człowieka (LD50), najsilniejszymi truciznami na świecie

&gt;- homeopatia operuje substancjami, które nie są tak toksyczne jak najsilniejsze trucizny w stężeniach co najmniej tysiące razy mniejszych, więc nawet jeżeli były by to najsilniejsze trucizny to i tak na organizm nie miały by wpływu przy takich dawkach.

&gt;- Popularny środek homeopatyczny na grypę, sprzedawany pod nazwą oscillococcinum, jest wątrobą kaczą rozcieńczoną w stosunku 1:10^400 (200C). Jako iż w obserwowalnym wszechświecie znajduje się około 10^80 atomów, rozcieńczenie jednej cząsteczki w nim wytworzyłoby rozcieńczenie 40C. Oscillococcinum dopiero w objętości wynoszącej około 10^320 objętości obserwowalnego wszechświata nie byłoby czystym rozpuszczalnikiem. Rodzi się pytanie czy aby wyprodukować go potrzeba wątroby. Drugie pytanie to czy czy nie jest zanieczyszczony słoniem którego stężenie wynosi tyle samo co wątroba kaczki czyli 1:10^400 z dokładnością do 1 atomu ;)

&gt;- Homeopatia to placebo II generacji

dukearcher,,,"All the logical fallacies aside, this was a shit post on your behalf mate.  I'm comparing the difference a country can make with only the leader changed. No one is mentioning superhumans...

The actions of Neville Chamberlain and his appeasement program helped put Europe in the awkward predicament of WW2 in the first place.  Yes a very, very bad leader did that.  Old mate painter down Elbury Lane didn't do that.

Of course the POTUS can make influential decisions that can shape the history of the U.S and world in general ...he may decide to deploy troops to a certain place out of anger rather than competence in strategy, sparking a global war, if I have to use an egregious example like you have with your wall of text...

Of course all the trades you listed are important, but each individual tradesman doesn't bear the responsibilities and power of the leader, hence why in the modern world the CEO is paid so much; they are (expected) to bear the full responsibility of a good or bad decision, and in a perfect scenario are chosen because of their competence.  Companies fail or succeed largely because of an effective leadership team.  Do you think Virgin would be Virgin without Branson or Spacex be what it is without Elon?  If the cartographer down the hallway also happened to be an inspiring individual, why wouldn't he be the leader?

You use Costa Rica as an example - barring geographical downsides, with a good leader at the helm at right points in history, who is to say that couldn't have happened?  Little old Portugal at one point was one of the two most powerful empires on the planet.  You think bad leadership got them there?  Venezuela is resource rich and well situated yet (largely) because of two useless, selfish leaders look what happened.  If they'd have had a José Mujica or even an early Simon Bolivar (pre politics era) things might have been different.

Your example of Nazi Germany is quite silly - Hitler's charisma and ability to rally people using issues close to their heart and manipulate the country into doing what it did required (evil?) brilliance.

You seem to despise the idea of the 'great men' concept, likely due to the realisation you aren't one of them, like most of us, and instead of getting on with it, you have chosen to just get angry and deny it exists.

The Generalplan Ost (German pronunciation: [ɡenəˈʁaːlˌplaːn ˈɔst]; English: Master Plan for the East), abbreviated GPO, was the Nazi German government's plan for the genocide and ethnic cleansing on a vast scale, and colonization of Central and Eastern Europe by Germans. It was to be undertaken in territories occupied by Germany during World War II. The plan was partially realized during the war, resulting indirectly and directly in a very large number of deaths, but its full implementation was not considered practicable during the major military operations, and was prevented by Germany's defeat.

The plan entailed the enslavement, expulsion, and mass murder of most Slavic peoples in Europe along with planned destruction of their nations, whom the 'Aryan' Nazis viewed as racially inferior. The programme operational guidelines were based on the policy of Lebensraum designed by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in fulfilment of the Drang nach Osten (drive to the East) ideology of German expansionism.

**Japanese war crimes**

Japanese war crimes occurred in many Asian and Pacific countries during the period of Japanese imperialism, primarily during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. These incidents have been described as an Asian Holocaust. Some war crimes were committed by military personnel from the Empire of Japan in the late 19th century, although most took place during the first part of the Shōwa Era, the name given to the reign of Emperor Hirohito, until the surrender of the Empire of Japan in 1945.

Some historians and governments hold Japanese military forces, namely the Imperial Japanese Army, the Imperial Japanese Navy, and the Imperial Japanese family, especially under Emperor Hirohito, responsible for the deaths of millions, some estimate between 3 and 14 million civilians and prisoners of war through massacre, human experimentation, starvation, and forced labor that was either directly perpetrated or condoned by the Japanese military and government. Some Japanese soldiers have admitted to committing these crimes.

WikiTextBot,,,"**Witch-cult hypothesis**

The witch-cult hypothesis is a discredited theory that the witch trials of the Early Modern period were an attempt to suppress a pre-Christian, pagan religion that had survived the Christianisation of Europe. According to its proponents, this witch-cult revolved around the worship of a Horned God of fertility whom the Christian persecutors referred to as the Devil, and whose members participated in nocturnal rites at the witches' Sabbath in which they venerated this deity.

The theory was pioneered by German scholars Karl Ernst Jarcke and Franz Josef Mone in the early nineteenth century, before being adopted by the French historian Jules Michelet, American feminist Matilda Joslyn Gage, and American folklorist Charles Leland later in that century. The hypothesis received its most prominent exposition when adopted by the British Egyptologist Margaret Murray, who presented her version of it in The Witch-Cult in Western Europe (1921), before further expounding it in books like The God of the Witches (1931) and in her contribution to the Encyclopædia Britannica.

Logic1978,,,"&gt;I believe the state is there to protect my freedom and sovereignty and let me live how I want to

You believe that's what it *should* be for, but that in practice it may be malicious. 

That's why you're against vaccines, you fear the government using them as a weapon. 

The government doesn't need that weapon, they have another one. It's the monopoly on force you give them called cops and the military. You happily pay for this 

If a government is willing to use biological warfare against its citizens, why the fuck wouldn't they use their military and conventional force? 

&gt; That doesn't include telling me what goes in me.

Fine, but if you wanna go to someone else's country they might make you if you want to go. Also, you may need to be vaccinated to work for the government or use services (like public schools). This is to provide ""blanket immunity"" for the general population. 

You would not have freedom and sovereignty without vaccines. It's hard to keep society stable when half the population is dead and the other half at constant fear of being sick. I sound like a broken record, but plagues literally put Europe behind hundreds of years in a Dark Age. 

&gt;You seem to think it's okay for the state to use the army to kill its citizens. I don't. 

That's current US law wether you like it or not cupcake. Wether I agree or not is irrelevant. If the government decides to use that force I'm fucked. That being said I understand the need for a military. There's a certain trade off libertarians make with the state and you're not willing to make that trade based on logic. You should be an individual anarchist 

They're really not different in terms of calculated risks: 

-Vaccinations are required to go use government services or enter other countries -- the aim of this is to protect society from epidemics. Literally events that could kill over half of our population. These are real threats prevented by vaccines. 

-You are required to pay taxes to the government and a huge portion of that money goes towards the military. The aim of this is to protect society from outside coercion. This is a real threat as shown by history.

SirPlagueDoctor,,,"Hello! I'm Holo from AKUMA.

Akuma is a european based Multi-Gaming community. Multi gaming implies that you can play with people outside of our missions as well. We have gamenights if enough people want it. 
(For example, we had CIV5, Insurgency, HOI4 gamenights so far.)

There's no age restriction, and we do not require that you have a working mic, (however having one certainly helps) but during missions you are required to join the TFAR channel.
We understand that everyone has lives, so you are not obliged to turn up to every single event, however if you are completely absent for more than 2 weeks please notify someone about it.

We have players from America and Good-Korea despite being european based, due to our missions being at Saturdays, 19:30 CEST. 
(Might vary, in extreme cases, but this was the case in all of our official missions so far)
We have unorganized, less serious Zeus events sometimes, when enough people want to play Arma just for the fun of it.


TL;DR about us: No age restriction, european, official missions 19:30 CEST Saturday, lax attendance, sometimes non-serious events during week if we have time and energy.

Nobody_Anybody,,,"“Samenwerken en macht weggeven of autonomie en je achter je grenzen verstoppen.”

Kijk nu doe jij het ook, dus of je werkt samen (en dan werken we dus via een EU principe) of je wilt een muur om Nederland (“je achter je grenzen verstoppen.”). Onzin natuurlijk. Je kunt prima samenwerken en toch autonomie hebben.

Niet alleen kan dat, dat is de enige werkende oplossing voor Europa. Veel verschillende landen met verschillende culturen, verschillende economieën, verschillende politiek en verschillende manieren van denken. De EU probeert daar een land met een cultuur, een manier van denken, een politiek en een economie van te maken. Daarom is het on Europees, en daarom werkt het ook niet want de mentaliteit van de mensen in die landen verander je niet zomaar even.

Je kunt prima ‘open’ grenzen hebben terwijl je soevereinen landen bent. Nogmaals, dat hebben we in de Benelux ook zo gehad. Je kunt je wel afvragen tot waar je gaat. Hou je bijvoorbeeld alleen geen actieve grenscontroles en zijn geen visums verplicht of mag je ook niet zomaar iemand (iemand uit een ander land) het land uit zetten?

Maar voor het idee van open grenzen heb je geen EU nodig en kun je prima soevereine landen zijn die met elkaar samen werken. Het grote verschil is wel dat je als soeverein land dit zelf in de hand laat. Wil je er mee stoppen, dan stemmen de burgers na 4 jaar voor een meerderheid in de kamer die er mee willen stoppen. Wil je er toch bepaalde voorwaarden bij hebben dan kan dan ook vanuit het nationale parlement geregeld worden. Het zelfde geld dan voor alle landen waar we mee samen werken. Dit in tegenstelling tot de EU manier waarbij ooit een keer iets is getekend en het daarna in feite uit handen wordt gegeven aan een centraal machtsorgaan.

“De EU wordt vaak gezien als een vorm van die intensieve samenwerking.” De EU is in feite een staatsvorm. Een manier van samenwerking zo je wilt. Iets dat ook op andere manieren kan, maar dan is het dus geen EU meer. En daar zit het zich dus ook in. Anti EU is niet anti samenwerking, maar anti deze manier van samenwerking.

“Mensen voor de EU zijn voor samenwerking. Mensen tegen de EU zijn voor autonomie.” Nouja, veel mensen die -zeggen / denken- pro-EU te zijn, zijn helemaal niet zo pro EU. Als je dan met ze praat zijn ze inderdaad pro samenwerking, maar vaak zelfs anti EU. Zo heb ik wel eens gehoord. “Natuurlijk ben ik pro EU, we moeten goed samenwerken, ik heb het alleen niet zo op dat gedoe in Brussel.” Tja dan ben je dus anti EU (dat gedoe in Brussel).
Dus hoewel de mensen die zeggen pro-EU te zijn, inderdaad vaak pro samenwerking zijn. Is EU toch niet het zelfde als samenwerking. Die mensen worden bewust voor de gek gehouden. Want dit is precies zoals de heren politici het over brengen. EU is samenwerking, en anti-EU is een muur om Nederland. Maar dat is feitelijk de grootste onzin die uit komt.

“Er zijn allerlei genuanceerde standpunten te bedenken (een nadeel van een ja/nee referendum).” Dit is ook iets dat ik vaak hoor als argument tegen een referendum. Maar dat is natuurlijk een stro-man. Je doet daarvoor namelijk eerst de foutieve aanname dat een referendum ja / nee moet zijn, om vervolgens het referendum aan te vallen op het ‘feit’ dat het referendum alleen maar ja of nee kan zijn. Dat is echter natuurlijk geen feit. Het is prima mogelijk een referendum te houden met meerdere opties.

“Je stelt dat alle pro-EU mensen kortzichtigheid stimuleren” Volgens mij heb ik niet gezegd dat alle pro-EU mensen dat doen. Wel eurofielen / de Pechtolds van deze wereld en de pro-EU politiek. Pechtold is al heel vaak gewezen op het verschil tussen EU en Europa, maar toch maakt hij bewust de keuze om over ‘Europa’ te spreken waar het de EU betreft. Dit zelfde zie je bij heel veel politici en zelfs media. En wanneer ze voor argumenten voor de EU wordt gevraagd komen ze met (niet EU specifieke) voorbeelden zoals samenwerking en vrede. Ja, zulke mensen zijn inderdaad bewust bezig kortzichtigheid stimuleren. En niet heel onbewust ook, want ik wil niet weten hoeveel burgers niet zeggen pro-EU te zijn (en dus pro EU stemmen) maar eigenlijk pro samenwerking te zijn maar juist anti EU. Als al die mensen deze nuance zouden doorkrijgen dan zou er mijn inziens weinig draagvlak voor de EU meer over blijven.

“dat ze anti-EU mensen over één kam scheren en geen oog hebben voor de precieze standpunten die anti-EU mensen hebben.” Dit zien we toch een beetje bij de referendums. Er komt een smoesje “dit is waar jullie tegen waren” dus hier komt een A4tje waar op staat dat het verdrag daar niet over gaat en nu jullie mond houden. Door van de EU Europa te maken, en te doen alsof pro EU samenwerking is en anti EU dus tegen samenwerking is, doe je dan in feite wel.

“Je generaliseert alle pro-EU mensen tot bedriegers die anti-EU mensen generaliseren.” Nee ik generaliseer niet alle pro-EU mensen. Ik adresseer juist de bedriegers die bewust het argument impliceren na pro en anti samenwerking.

Maar waar precies generaliseer ik volgens jou? Dat de discussie vaak bewust wordt gedraaid naar “anti samenwerken / pro samenwerking” is een feit dat jij zelf ook hier erkent. “De EU wordt vaak gezien als een vorm van die intensieve samenwerking. - Dit is, zoals jij terecht opmerkt, een veel te simplistisch beeld.”. Het opmerken daarvan is niet generaliseren.

Dr_Richard_Kimble1,,,"Thanks for your response. I believe we can all learn from each other as long as we are willing to engage.

&gt; In your brave new world with a global government what will safeguard us against the tyranny of the majority? 

Good question. As we know, global government will not be immune from the same things as nationalistic governments of today. For example we do not have global government today, but we still have plenty countries like Saudi Arabia, North Korea, etc. which are one party totalitarian systems. No global government needed for the tyranny, we have had 1000 examples of it in history, and that is all without a global government. So therefore tyranny is not exclusive to global governemnt.

So your question, what will safeguard us against the tyranny of the majority is a good one. The answer is the same thing that safeguards the USA from the tyranny of the majority. Decentralization of power, checks and balances, separation of power, guarantee of individual rights, etc. The global government should basically be modeled after western liberal secular governments, which have basic principles of freedom of speech, individualism, etc. guaranteed. Also guaranteed should be the right to leave such a union if one desired (European Union is a good example in that it allows its member to leave if they want).

&gt; For example what if 80% of the worlds population think ""hey you know what, let's just take all of the diamonds from the Congo and Botswana, we don't have to pay the people who live there for them, they won't be able to stop us."" The world government sends its robot army to the Congo and Botswana and starts mining all of the diamonds, the majority of people agree with this and the media portrays it as a positive thing, reminding everyone that they will get discounted shares in prominent mining companies if they support the occupation.

Ok, there are a couple of problems in this scenario. First of all Congo and Botswana would be part of the global union, they are not some foreign lands waiting to be exploited by the evil global union, they would be part of it.

&gt; It's not like the Congo or Botswana could secede from the global government and found their own independent states, they would be hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned.

Their right to leave would be one of the fundamental rights of such a union, just like the EU, but honestly by the time a global union exists I think humans will be so advanced they will not think of things like nationalism anymore, but still the right is there. 

Again, ultimately it comes down to the trust you put into the system you create. I can apply the same logic to the USA can I not? As a matter of fact, we saw in the USA during the Civil War that secession is basically not possible. This in the USA of all places.

&gt; Why does every progressives conception of a global government assume that the majority of people will be nice and will respect minorities? It doesn't seem to be the case on a global scale now.

I don't assume that. I truly am confident that if we work hard enough we can progress to the point where tolerance of differences of opinions, respect of minorities, etc. are achievable. 

Me, being an American I like to compare the USA of today to the USA of the 1800s. We have made PROGRESS (not always linear, it has ups and downs) in areas such as women's rights, minorities rights, elimination of slavery, etc. In EVER SINGLE CASE the conservative/traditionalist side was defeated, and they always use the exact same arguments to try and hold back progress and yet they always lose. This shows me that humanity is destined to PROGRESS i.e. progressive as long as we have the political will. 

I completely know where you are coming from by the way and I myself held similar suspicions of such ideas in the past, but if you think logically then there is really no other solution. 

You posed an interesting hypothetical dilemma regarding the diamonds, now I'd like to ask you one. 

This one is very feasible and currently a fact of life for many people/nations.

Imagine hypothetically if you are born in a country with very little natural resources, a desert area, no fossil fuels, very little water, basically very few of the essentials to make a prosperous economy/nation. As you mentioned yourself we do not choose where we are born do we? So it is not really in our control. So now I ask you, what are the people born in these areas supposed to do? There is no mechanism for them to basically improve their situation dramatically. How do they make it? Are they destined to be poor for all eternity with no chance just because of your good fortune in being born in somewhere else?

Another interesting dilemma is this one. This one is more something you have to imagine, but still the concept is relevant.

Imagine hypothetically, that we discover a natural resource in for example, North Korea. This natural resource has the ability to basically guarantee infinite energy for humanity or some other extremely positive attribute which could basically put the world at its mercy. It is ONLY found in North Korea. So now are we to simply be at the mercy of North Korea and its monopoly over this resource forever? I understand this one is not as compelling as the first one, but it is still an interesting thought experiment. 

Ultimately there is no denying the fact that certain issues require global solutions. If we are 300 different policies from each state/entity dealing with disease/vaccines, environmental issues, human rights, etc. then we will basically progress at a snails pace. Who would want that? Of course certain issues like taxation, entertainment, sports, etc. can be dealt with on a more local level.

Try to keep this vision of a sic-fi dystopian society out of your head when analyzing global government. Global government has the same chance of falling into tyranny as non-global government does. Was Naz Germany, Fascist Italy, Imperial Japan, globalist? Saudi, North Korea, Cuba, etc. globalist? 

Globalism does not automatically mean dystopian hellhole. As with ANY system of government there are risks and we should take precautions to mitigate the chances of falling into tyranny, as the founders of the USA did. 

Try to think 500 years into the future (if humanity still exists). We will have colonized other planets by then most likely. They will probably look back and laugh at the mere thought that nationalism was sacrosanct. The same way we today ridicule tribes and religions of 3000 years ago.",True,0,1506855600,,False,0,dnr2n5u,False,t3_73f2xb,t1_dnr204w,/r/europe/comments/73f2xb/catalonia_referendum_megathread/dnr2n5u/,1509200592,1,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,

electriCT,metal,\m/,"Je peux pas la blairer perso. Mais de ce que je comprends, elle reprochait à Rousseau l'injonction aux victimes du viol à prendre la parole. Si je me trompe pas l'idée c'est ""chaque victime du viol vit la chose de sa manière à elle, et ça ne regarde qu'elle, la façon de le gérer. Certaines préfèrent passer à autre chose rapidement, ne veulent pas se laisser ""définir"" comme victimes, et on ne peut pas leur imposer de parler, de militer ou autre"". De la même façon que la victime de Polanski a fini par en avoir marre, et ne souhaite pas qu'on continue cette histoire - c'est terrible, ce dégueulasse s'en tirera indemne mais elle a déjà été violée, lui faire ressasser le truc toute sa vie est un peu une double peine.

Sur le fond je lui dirai qu'elle a pas tort. Par contre là où elle a tort c'est que les victimes sont bien souvent forcées de se taire. Donc oui il ne faut pas les forcer à parler, par contre c'est primordial de créer des ""outlets"" pour recueillir la parole des victimes et les accompagner dans l'après. Ce que Rousseau fait c'est peut être maladroit ou imparfait mais la démarche est plus que louable. Lui rentrer dans le lard de cette manière c'est faire le jeu des violeurs à mon sens. Angot a eu sa façon a elle de gérer le truc, qu'on ne peut que respecter, mais elle est écrivain, vit dans un monde d'intellos, de showbiz, en tout cas un certain microcosme. En tapant sur Rousseau finalement elle se rend coupable de ce qu'elle dénonce, le fait d'imposer sa vision du viol aux autres.

Idontknowmuch,,,"The ones who are against consider that the referendum is illegal anyway. Although apparently they are a majority who want a referendum to decide - but a lawful referendum.

&gt; Haven't you heard the Azeri ""argument"" that the Karabakh referendum was bullshit because Azeris didn't vote at all

The Karabakh case was across ethnic lines. Armenians were a majority (70 something %) and the vast majority (over 90%) wanted independence. So there is no doubt what the will of the people was. The Catalan case absolutely is not like this and it is not cut through ethnic lines. Not to mention that there is no real clear cut ethnic division anyway, there are a lot of mixed families and Catalans who feel Spanish as well, etc. So ethnicity is not the main factor whereas in Karabakh it was.

They can know the participation though. And the Catalan president is on record saying that even a participation of 7% is valid as there is no precedent for a minimum participation in referenda. So in theory a 7% participation of 51% yes implies that 93% of the population which didn't vote don't get their voice heard and the region still gets to declare independence. This is not exactly democratic nor has any parallels with Karabakh.

There is a massive difference between Armenians and Catalans here as well. The only oppression Catalans face is not having full economic and tax independence (which is important for them I agree) and having their own independent state. They face no other oppression. Not exactly the case with Armenians of Azerbaijan. Yet they paint and actually say (check the thread) that Spain is literally a dictatorship like Turkey or another third world country.

What Catalans could do, and actually have been doing, is to work with Spaniards in changing Spain for the better, including make it a federal system or even to make regions be able to secede. This is absolutely doable, the last few years saw the left gain massive inroads in politics and they are for allowing a referendum. However this process was disrupted because some power hungry Catalan politicians couldn't wait to get what they want. The amount of propaganda is too much as well. Catalans have literally been bombarded for many years of how their money is sent to pave highways elsewhere in Spain and how they are more European than the rest so they need to secede. Ignoring that is the whole point of the European model, to share resources. With all of this I don't want to say that their self-determination is not valid independently of motives, which I don't. But it is not the same case. Armenians faced pogroms and deaths. No such thing has happened in Spain (and no, the police brutality you see now where Catalans are blocking police entering voting stations is not even remotely comparable to the pogroms Armenians faced).

&gt; I know that the comparison is kind of dumb because Spain isn't Azerbaijan

Look at the comments and how many literally say it is (although not naming Azerbaijan, but you get the point).

Finally they are on a crash course because what they are doing is going to harm Catalonia and Spain. There is no winner here. The Spanish government is acting stupid as well. It is a forced situation, with a lot of populism in it, specially from the Catalan side. Completely different situation with Karabakh.

Look at the flipside. If you don't support the right of Madrid to enforce the rules of its constitution, do you support anyone, *anywhere* freely flouting them? Do you acknowledge the right of Texas to secede? What about, say, Harris County? What about Fort Worth and only Fort Worth? What about the Jones family of 123 Fake Street? What's the smallest unit that you think *is* allowed to secede?

Honestly? No, I don't think Catalonia has the right to secede without the say-so of the rest of the country; they did, after all, freely agree to that in the constitution in 1978. I don't think Scotland has the right to unilaterally secede. I don't think Northern Ireland does. I don't think Texas does either. I think it's economically a terrible idea to go splitting up countries, not to mention that in a world where we're trying to remove borders as far as possible -- I'm extremely opposed to Brexit -- then this is a step in the wrong direction.

&gt;Labour running their campaign on that issue turned out to have have frantic support between young people. This is your view, it doesn't seem to be the view of people affected by it.

All this means is that there is a debate over who is right on an issue. The fact that people are arguing a side doesn't make them right. That has to be shown on the facts... thus why we are having an argument.

In any case, that people are self-interested is nothing new. Telling young people you will give them free stuff and other people will have to pay for it is unsurprisingly popular with them. It doesn't justify the policy.

&gt;To be honest, at this point it feels like a clash of the german allmende mentality with the anglo-saxon individuality/""if everyone cares for themselve everyone is cared for""-approach. I guess we can't bridge that cultural gap.

Not sure what the Anglo-Saxons have to do with it. They haven't been around in almost 1000 years.

Jokes aside, I disagree that it's such a clash of ideas. I'm perfectly happy to endorse the funding of services and social mobility via taxation. Thus my support for higher primary school education funding via an increase in taxation. I just don't think the policy you are proposing is justifiable on its merits. It would not achieve the goal that it sets for itself. It would not increase social mobility, or the quality of education, nor would it lead to a more just tax distribution.

Today at 16:00 teams **BIG and Space Soldiers** are fighting within *closed EU qualification* for *EPICENTER 2017*. Confrontation format is Bo3. Losing team will leave the competition, and the winner will get a chance to play in playoffs. Group B structure: HellRaisers, Heroic, fnatic, mousesports. Bets on [the game](https://csgobets.com/match/86441/BIG-vs-Space-Soldiers-EPICENTER-2017-Europe-Closed-Qualifier) are almost the same, but only one team will go further.

Opponents have not met yet. In last five matches, the Turkish team won four times, but [BIG](https://csgobets.com/team/BIG) scored three victories. Bookmakers odds: BIG 1.78, Space Soldiers 1.93. Last match Turks lost to Virtus.pro with a score of 2-3, although they showed a good quality of gaming. Space Soldiers in recent matches managed to beat EnVyUs Academy, FlipSid3 and Kinguin, and first two fights were with a score of 2-0. Despite the odds, [Space Soldiers](https://csgobets.com/team/Space%20Soldiers) have good chances to win in [today's match](https://csgobets.com/match/86441/BIG-vs-Space-Soldiers-EPICENTER-2017-Europe-Closed-Qualifier), but BIG is unlikely to allow their elimination from the tournament. 

**My prediction** is **the victory of BIG** with a score of 2-1.

HyperCuriousMe,,,"This is tied into Trump's election. Whilst the US election was running, the 'official narrative' was called the 'European Fairy Tale'. The idea was that it would have been used to stop Brexit and also keep the problems of Europe quiet until Hillary was in office. The idea was to portray the EU, and Scandinavia as a socialist utopia and model for the United State to emulate in terms of healthcare and immigration, to give just two examples. Of course this failed and the rest is history. Now we're seeing commies causing trouble and splitting Spain in half all in the name of nationalism. This all but kills their new narrative of 'evil right wing nationalism/populism'. This is a nightmare for the EU. The  Left have proclaimed [Merkel the new leader of the Free World](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/angela-merkel-donald-trump-democracy-freedom-of-press-a7556986.html) and now they get to see the use of violence to pursue EU goals. So much for 'free world', eh? Officially, of course, the EU has said they have no role in all of this, but then Madrid has cited the EU as the reason for suppressing the vote saying that it, ['runs counter to the goals and ideals of the European Union'](http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/10/01/catalonia-referendum-livewire-spain-moves-suppress-vote-runs-counter-goals-ideal-eu/). What a surprise. The EU can't even keep its own story straight. Pure bureaucratic incompetence. 

Anyway, long and short of this is that this is a disaster for the global interest groups who backed Hillary and undermines their attempts at propaganda suggesting the EU is fine and running smoothly. Sure it weakens Spain and is a balkanization of the nation, but let them run with it. As leftists always do they will tank the region economically further destroying their own narrative. It also frames the radical left as a danger and a source of political instability. All of this is good for Trump. We're witnessing the failure of globalism and the reemergence of the nation state in real time. Anyway, it is complex matter, but it is also important we keep up to date with what's happening as it will prove critical by the time the next election comes around.

They are just following the mindset of their parents or grandparents without even knowing the benefits and the burden that comes with independence. 

You can say to just let them vote and say its unlawful. Ok and then what? They will try again and again. 

I live in Barcelona and think that the problems that the Catalans have will not be solved with independence but with good economic policies.
For example, the regional government is 42 billion euros in debt yet still receives millions of euros from the EU.

They could have voted for having more economical liberty from the policies issued by Madrid if that is gonna help. But independence? I think Catalans just want to be able to say: ""I have my own flag, look at it.""

The EU has significant political clout and while it cannot force a country to do anything beyond what a country has obligated itself to do, the EU can act as a mediator between nations in situations which call for one.

Also, ""illegal refugees"" is an incredibly biased statement and not really true.

I've been to approximately 40 countries but in at least half of those I've barely scratched the surface. In Europe alone I can think of a dozen countries where I only visited 1-2 big cities. I've been to Paris 3 times, for example, but have been nowhere else in France (apart from a day trip to Versailles)...Dublin, Tallin, Riga, Amsterdam, Vienna...same story...I've been to the capital but that's it.

Most of my European travels were when I was much younger and hopped around too quickly...I did something stupid like 17 countries in 3 months on one trip alone.

MrMehawk,,,"It's already being fixed, gradually but continuously. The important thing here is that science as a whole has a remarkable success rate over the decades and to change it rapidly would be taking a completely unnecessary risk. The changes may seem slow and prodding within a single human lifespan but they are happening and gradually improving science. Making these changes faster risks one of the most important things humanity has to offer, every step needs to be taken with care.

In recent years, open access journals or at least a combination of publication in peer-reviewed journal and a version on something like arxiv.org after a while has started to slowly garner respect, different fields are still working out the details of how a sensible compromise can be found between open access and still having a high quality peer-review system - both of which are desirable.

Different organisations and projects are also working towards improving peer-review in various ways, either by creating independent quality checks or by thinking about novel methodologies (which again, due to their risky nature need to be checked before a change is implemented).

The reason you are aware of the issue of reproducibility is because it is actually already being discussed, already being addressed. You didn't come up with it by yourself. The improvement of peer-review and more open access are one branch of attempts to mitigate these problems and another attempt that is also being carefully experimented with is (again, depending on the field) broad-scale reproduction attempts, increased respect for meta-reviews / meta-analyses instead of single results and a bigger focus on statistical and mathematical tools to guide us through how significant something actually is.

On top of these, progress has recently also been made with regards to the publication of negative results, which would help science out a lot as well. Some journals and scientists are testing if there is sufficient interest in this and while this has yet to gain major traction, it is something that scientists have been trying to work out for a while and is now closer to being implemented than ever before. Another big recent improvement is that scientists more and more actually attach their data sets in certain journals which enforce or allow this, in order to make reproduction and checking their methods simpler.

On the issue of ineffective teaching practices, this decade has seen more progress and experimentation with new teaching methods than the entirety of the past millennium has. Flipped classroom models, MOOCs and their implementation within universities has been, again **carefully and slowly**, tested and experimented with in order to gauge if it is a viable option. One can't just knock over a well functioning system without being sure the new system is better. One thing is for certain, though, the terms flipped classroom and MOOCs will only keep gaining importance (within certain fields) and universities are also increasingly providing PDF format lecture notes and lecture streams, something that was impossible just a short while ago.

On the overproduction of PhDs, I'll have to politely disagree with you that there is even such a problem ""in science"" or ""in academia"". On one hand these are primarily economic concerns within certain countries (the US? I don't know where you are from but this isn't a problem everywhere, so not an issue of ""academia"".) you are talking about and academia shouldn't be changed as a whole in order to accommodate non-academic issues within a particular country. That said, as far as this problem goes you can only opt for one of three options: 

1. Create more jobs for PhD students (this is an economic issue and not an issue of academia) or 
2. create more strict entrance criteria with one of those standardized entrance exams which have largely been suspected as unrepresentative of academic success and thus would unfortunately eliminate potentially great scientists from arising or 
3. Let as many people in as you reasonably can, enabling people of varied backgrounds to take their best shot and have the unfortunate side-effect of possibly ending up with a few PhDs which will have to pursue non-academic jobs after their education.

It seems to me that except for (1), which isn't within the power of academics or academia, (3) is to be preferred over (2). I'd argue (3) is the status quo in most continental European countries at the moment, I think the UK and US are attempting a balancing act of (2) and (3) with sometimes better and sometimes worse results. But if you have a reasonable 4th option, I'm open to hear it.

To summarize: Academia is not ""broken"" but every human endeavor is flawed. All the issues you speak of are not only known, they are and have been in the process of being addressed for a good time now and improvements on most ends are undeniable. Rushing to ""reform"" one of the most important and successful driving factors of human well-being and progress because of a few ultimately small issues would be neck-breakingly risky and simply not worth it. Instead, academia is slow moving because it carefully analyses the changes that are possible and how they would impact the function of the scientific enterprise. If you value any one of these changes, a good thing to do instead of calling for reform, is to pick one of these issues you care the most about and either volunteer in the many projects working and experimenting on the issues or at least donate to their efforts if that would be too much work for you.

moneckew,,,"I think Catalans are very selfish people. Just because your region is wealthier than the rest of the country does not give you an excuse to put independence in the peoples mind. Yes, you can say that Franco was harsh on the catalan people and I would understand if 60 year olds would protest pro-independence. But most of these young adults dont even have an idea how Franco even looks. They are just following the mindset of their parents or grandparents without even knowing the benefits and the burden that comes with independence. 

You can say to just let them vote and say its unlawful. Ok and then what? They will try again and again. 

I live in Barcelona and think that the problems that the Catalans have will not be solved with independence but with good economic policies.
For example, the regional government is 42 billion euros in debt yet still receives millions of euros from the EU.

They could have voted for having more economical liberty from the policies issued by Madrid if that is gonna help. But independence? I think Catalans just want to be able to say: ""I have my own flag, look at it."" 

Good on you. You got a flag and maybe an hymn but you fucked up Europes long lasting peace and you also give incentive to other EU wealthy regions to consider Independence (i.e. Bavaria, Madeira). I am ashamed.

TrolliciousCuisine,,,"&gt;  Canada wasn't even a country at that point

Well of course not. 

Spain's decline pretty much occurred a century or so after Columbus found the Americas. Reason being: Spain became over-dependent on New World gold and silver to buy everything (in particular: finished manufactured goods).  Meanwhile, their European rivals became manufacturing (and later industrial) giants fueled by Spain's purchasing power. 

When Spain began losing their purchasing power due to various reasons (chief of which: other European nations beginning to colonize the Americas + inflation pretty much rekt the value of silver), Spain found itself with an underdeveloped economy filled with unskilled workers (gg kicking out the Moors) and also kinda isolated since they were basically going to war with everyone when they had all dat money. They've been trying to recover ever since with varying degrees of non-success. 

tl;dr Spain lost its status as a superpower in the 17th century due to bad decisions and continues to make bad decisions to this very day in an effort to recover.

A simplified summary of history, but to get back to your point: yeah, Canada was deeeefinitely not a country at that time. 

&gt;sounds like excuses

Meh, my post was really meant to reply to OP's surprise that this is happening. It isn't ""an extremely worrying trend,"" as he claims.

Dooretta,,,"Okay, now I *will* get a little wordy.

Are you the one who decides what levels of force are necessary? Or are there laws that determine that? The levels of force you’ve deemed necessary -breaking her fingers, and stepping on her face- for the sake of *a hat*, speak to something frightening in you that’s just below the surface. Whatever that something is, if you react that way over a hat, you’re going to jail. No kidding. The arresting officer won’t care about your principles. And you’re going to need a good lawyer, by the way.

What I’m seriously suggesting is that *you*, not “people”, have some growing up to do. You don’t get to hide your foolishness behind a false generalization.


Think beyond your own nose for a moment:

From the perspective of the woman in the video, the dominant European culture nearly exterminated her ancestors, stole their land, and extinguished their culture. And all for the sake of “Manifest Destiny”. The majority who remain live in desperate poverty. I guarantee she grew up learning her people’s history more deeply than you or I did ours. She’s not disconnected from her ancestors; she is them. I’m no authority, but I can offer that small insight because I’ve spent a bit of time in the Navajo Nation.

Tell me: if anybody has the moral high ground to talk about forceful defense of self and property, who is it? Is it the woman whose family survived genocide, or some schmuck on Reddit who watched a video?

The world has much larger issues to tackle than stolen hats. And if you think that moralizing and unjustified violence are good answers to those problems, then you need a time out. Maybe spend some time with the poor and underprivileged, or do some sort of service project where you and your interests are not at the center of your thoughts.

The thick one here is the one who cannot -or more likely *will* not- see anyone’s perspective but his own...

Im not saying im in favor of an illegal referendum, but im saying that in a democratic country such as spain, if the people ask for a referendum, they should be allowed to have one, without police inteference.

What im saying is, these are no longer tensions, these are police brutality, when you see pictures of elderly women, bleeding, because the police is hitting them/throwing them around, something is wrong. 

And i completly support the police striking against those, who throw stones at their vehicles/the police it self. But i dont support the police handling the situation with violence, as it directly breaks the human rights laws, set by the European union.

IM not saying anyone is fascests, im saying they're in their rights to block a referendum, as it's an illegal one. 
But im saying, in a civilized world, THE PEOPLE should be allowed to call for a vote, without the goverment blocking that vote.

And to be fair, i dont give 2 fucking shits, what the court called for. 
A court can NEVER call for violence to be the method of action, against people breaking the law, unless those who break the law, directly endanger the lives of others or those in uniform.

&gt; The cuirassier was the descendant of the medieval mounted knight and ancestor of the heavy cavalryman.  The term was adopted in the first quarter of the 17th century, at a time when the heavy lance was beginning to fall out of use on the battlefields of Northern Europe. Captain Cruso stated in his Militarie Instructions for the Cavallrie in 1632 that the cuirassier ""is to be armed at all points [...] his horse not inferior in stature and strength, though not so swift. He must have two cases with good firelock pistols hanging at his saddle [...] and a good sword stiffe and sharp pointed like the Lancier"". The cuirassier played a prominent role in the Thirty Years War and even took part in some of the early engagements of the English Civil War.7 The increased efficacy of firearms is reflected by a correspondingly greater weight in armour.  The present armour has been tested for its quality against both musket and pistol bullets as shown on the breast and backplates.  The practice of proving armour against weapons appears to have already existed in antiquity and is recorded by Plutarch. The earliest references to proving armour in the Middle Ages dates from the 14th century, with the rise in popularity of plate armour. In 1401, Francesco Gonzaga gave instructions to the Venetian armourer Zoana that he should ""make proof of the said armour with a good crossbow"". This practice was commonplace by the middle of the 15th century and crossbows were replaced by firearms in the 16th century.  By the early 17th century armour that was not proofed would have been of very limited use if any at all",True,0,1506865277,,False,0,dnr6tdg,True,t3_73loel,t3_73loel,/r/ArtefactPorn/comments/73loel/cuirassier_armour_sold_for_14m_north_italy_c_1600/dnr6tdg/,1509202825,7,False,ArtefactPorn,t5_313fb,

Gustacho,,,"Dear defenders of freedom worldwide, 

Spain is a democratic state with an almost federal system that gives regions like Catalonia a level of independence and autonomy that is unequalled in the European Union or OECD states. Even “pluri-national” states give less autonomy to their federal entities.

In Spain, there is a constitution that was massively voted (90% support in Catalonia). It sets the rights and obligations of all Spanish citizens and is the pillar of democracy. 

The Spanish transition to democracy and modernization is an internationally recognized success. 

The Spanish constitution grants sovereignty to ALL Spaniards, not to a group of them. Catalonia has voted more than 35 times since 1977 and enjoys a level of autonomy unequalled in the EU.

Any defender of freedom, as myself, will accept to change the constitution using legal and democratic means, with a real majority, not assaulting the laws of a democratic state using the subterfuge of alleged democratic instruments to intimidate and silence the majority. 

I cannot accept a process hijacked by totalitarians, (CUP and ERC are parties that defend totalitarian regimes and communist oppression) who never achieved a majority vote, based on intimidation and propaganda.

Therefore, let us debate and change the constitution, and achieve a truly democratic solution. Not a unilateral, illegal and manipulated vote where the regional government actively campaigns for one side, instead of all the people.

A detailed analysis of ""[The Super-Simple Reason Nazi Germany Crushed France](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/the-super-simple-reason-nazi-germany-crushed-france-during-19484)"" not only doesn't mention industrial capacity at all, but focuses strictly on overland tactics, _and the fact that France fell in a matter of weeks_, far too brief a time for attacks on industrial plant to have made a difference.  Similarly, as I consult my resources on the Beaches of Normandy, they're conspicuously lacking in any mention of the presence of heavy industry and factories there, and the logic of the _Allies_ to destroy French industry is similarly lacking.

It's surprisingly difficult to get _any_ geographical information on where French industry is located, though it seems heavily focused in or near Paris, and in the North-East.

I finally got my 1st CZ a few weeks ago. The SP-01 Tactical. It was my first all steel handgun and it's an absolute pleasure to shoot. Great recoil absorption and accuracy is on point. [Here is the post I made when I got it](https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/6yt02p/my_brand_new_cz_75_sp01_tactical/).  
  
Naturally, once you get a CZ, the CZickness sets in pretty bad, and upon browsing the CZ Forums I discovered this limited run, all steel, railed 75 compact. It's been dubbed the ""baby SP-01"" or ""SP-01 Compact"" due to its all steel frame, rail and extended beavertail. All unique characteristics of the SP-01. The SKU for this one is **99021**.  
  
You see, the typical CZ compact series pistol (PCR or P-01) are alloy framed. But [per this **84 page** thread](http://www.czfirearms.us/index.php?topic=83224.0) on the forums it appeared that only a few hundred of these were produced for a special contract in Europe that fell through. I highly recommend reading up on this pistol. It's rather interesting. The pistols were shipped stateside and were a huge success. They sold out from the distributors quite quickly and there was an immediate secondary market that was formed.  
  
Well, lucky for me, just 48 hours after picking up my SP-01 Tactical from my FFL, I saw that someone on the forums had one NIB to sell. In fact, he was responding to a WTB ad, but it turned out the OP wasn't even allowed to purchase this SKU since it was not CA approved. I immediately PM'd the guy who responded that he had one and we starting talking sale price. Then it turned out he works in the NJ county next to where I live. I took that as a sign and arranged to buy it! (Unfortunately I had to wait a month because among NJ's numerous awful gun laws is the 1 handgun a month law. Since I had *just* gotten the SP-01 Tactical 48 hours prior, I had to wait till last week to pick this baby up).  
  
The popularity of this particular gun is only growing, [and it just sold for almost $1,800 on GunBroker](http://www.gunbroker.com/Item/695019302)

&gt; Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont condemned the action of the national police and Guardia Civil, who were sent into Catalonia in large numbers to prevent the vote from taking place.

I also wasn't saying that the US minimum wage was bad compared to Europe, just pointing out that was probably what the guy above was referring to with his joke. It's quite likely I'm wrong.

Of course, as I don't live in the US or Europe I didn't really have an interest in either, but I had heard several people complain about the minimum wage in the US and assumed that was what he was referring. 

Minimum wage where I am Is about $13.66 US. Of course, cost of living is subsequently higher as a result, but the fact that a 17 year old from my country (Australia) has a higher minimum wage than a legal adult from the US seems strange.

Either way, what I really appreciate from you is the not just spouting shit and anecdotes and actually pushing forth evidence, and as a result I humbly stand corrected.

Lol, Spain is not fooling anyone. Couple extra vans of police and beating some people with batons and rubber bullets is not fooling anyone. 

Actually if Spain sent the army in I would be impressed with their perseverance and political will, but I and everybody knows they wont. Spanish system is a joke at the moment I am telling you and they are well aware they couldn't turn back time and force Catalonia back. The EU itself would expel Spain in such an event even if Spain had guts to do such a thing (which it doesn't). But by all means, let them prove me wrong, I have been wrong before. 

&gt; That is probably why they wanted to prevent secession so much. And yeah, most of other countries don't have such problems at the moment, but separatism tends to be pretty contagious. Lots of sleeping demons in Europe.

Dr_Richard_Kimble1,,,"&gt; Spain is more violent than the rest of european countries? I don't think so:

I meant the Spanish culture, not its crime rate. They seem to value violence and blood as part of their culture and entertainment. Crime is a different story. 

&gt; I've seen you are very focused on the bullfighting issue in other posts, but neither me or any other spanish poster could answer your questions about it.
There is a reason for that. Most spanish don't care at all for bullfighting, and don't follow news about it. Attendance to bullfighting events has been on a steady decline for the last couple of decades, and if the trend continues it will die by itself.
Honestly, calling Spain violent because a decreasing minority still enjoys bullfighting seems quite extreme to me, but whatever. Spain has other, real problems, at the moment.

You say decreasing minority, but apparently this decreasing minority is enough to compel the Spanish government to overturn a ban on bullfighting in Catalonia?

Honestly the bullfighting thing was the most prominent thing that stood out to me because I just can't understand the logic in Spanish central government overturning that Catalan ban. It's an easy one for me. This action leads me to believe that Catalan claims of too much interference in their affairs is generally true. If Spanish central gov. would intervene over something like bullfighting then what won't they interfere with? See the logic? 

It's not an obsession of mine to focus on bullfighting, it just seems to me like that would be an easy one for the Spanish government to just let the Catalonians have. Why pick that fight? 

I agree that I shouldn't call Spain violent. It is still a modern, advanced nation in terms of most metrics. I just meant that it seems there are certain very unusual conservative traditions that Spain maintains and can't let go. For some reason many of them do indeed involve hurting animals … so I dunno.

SwineHerald,,,"&gt;Take a look at impression threads for almost any sequel this generation, and you will see a similar comment.

That list has more in common than just being current gen sequels. They're all games made by different studios than the ones that created the series. Secondary studios missing what made a series great is nothing new. 

Sometimes it's a matter of just not being able to meet the same level of quality, but other times you end up with a developer trying to slaughter the sacred cow without even recognizing it's importance. 

Sure, most of the time the first new entry from a new studio will be promising. If they're smart they'll stick to the formula as best as they can to avoid alienating people. Being a new studio to the franchise can come with a lot of extra scrutiny. However, given some time to adjust it doesn't take long before they start wanting to knock out some walls and remodel.

Stuff like local multiplayer in Halo, *actual fucking choices* in Fallout and time constraints in Dead Rising seem like obvious things to include, but somehow with fresh eyes new studios still often want to try something new and make it their own.

This can work out well in some regards. I think both of Crystal Dynamics reboots to the Tomb Raider series were good for their time. Legend hasn't aged well, but neither have any of its predecessors and Legend was amazing back in 2006, which was more than anyone could say for Angel of Darkness at any point in time.

blueboarder,,,"Sorry left-leaning, a typo on my part.

Ok so USA v2. The biggest issues I have with the USA is their approach to healthcare, education and military. In the past few years conservatives have been sculpting the healthcare system to look more similar to the US. Increased privatisation and the ilk. Although we still have an NHS it's becoming increasingly apparent that the aim is to slowly start to make health insurance the better option. Fundamentally a health service for me is something that should never be turned into a business. It's an abhorrent concept.

For education in the past 5 years university tuition fees in England and Wales were increased three fold and is now the most expensive place to study in Europe. I know someone will chime in and say Scottish MPs voted for this policy too. Which I do find horrifying and they should be condemned for it. Personally a separate government in England for England would be something that should be considered to stop something like that. Increasing prices for university does nothing but prohibit the poorest of the country from being able to better themselves via degrees. Education should be an inherent right for all and stopping people who are capable of gaining a higher education because they cannot afford it is detrimental to the country and generally a shitty thing to do.

Militarily it's the constant interference in other countries and trying to police the world. Disproportionate spending and insistence on holding a nuclear arsenal. I understand that war is sometimes necessary but the recent necessary ones have been the result of previous unnecessary ones. 

As for the US as a laughing stock. You used to be great. When you embraced science and looked to better the world with it you were awesome. Now people deny science and even belittled it. The only thing you lead in is prisoners per capita in a profit run incarceration system. Vitriolic party politics has put the country into a stalemate as there is a constant stalemate between dems and reps. A countries issues can never be binary, so a binary two party system can never be functional. The US seems to be moving further right and shows no signs of stopping. Sure Democrats may win next election but it doesn't stop this binary nature of the political system in the US. It needs a complete overhaul in order to start a discourse between the two sides. But for that to happen the party in power needs to initiate it. Which will never happen as they will immediately lose the power they have just gained. 

The US is for me a terrifying place and I'm more terrified by the fact that it seems to be a prediction of what the UK will look like in the future.

Then why post it? It's not relevant in the slightest to shoehorn this agenda in. 

&gt; it seems far more likely they were placing their UK efforts towards Brexit instead. 

Brexit hadn't yet been announced, Cameron didn't call the vote until a year after the 2014 indyref. He didn't want to, he'd made a referendum promise with the full expectations of not winning outright and therefore not having to do it. The Tory majority shocked everyone and he had to follow through, literally no one saw this coming, the 2015 election result was a major upset. The referendum promise was an attempt to regain votes lost to UKIP, stemming from decades-old anti-EU sentiment stoked largely by the right-wing UK press.

&gt; The UK's ties to NATO were never in doubt, and are not strengthened by Brexit.

I guess you haven't been following UK politics of late. Right now the most popular candidate is staunchly anti-NATO. He's not in power right now but the present Tory government is on it's last legs, with top level ministers openly attacking the PMs policies. His background can easily be surmised by pointing out how reluctant he is to criticise the current actions of the Venezuelan government. 

Brexit pretty much forces the UK into the USA's arms. This has been a huge topic in news lately, especially this past week with the recent tariffs imposed on Bombardier, an aircraft parts manufacturer with factories in the UK. Many feel this relationship isn't the good kind of ""special"". 

&gt; Their strategy regarding NATO seems to be Trump-based, instead.

Russia didn't win for Trump either. He won by using open racism instead of the usual republican dog-whistles. Millions of older Americans who remember fondly the days when blacks had to sit at the back of the bus lapped this up. It's uncomfortable to say out loud but its' true.

Legally those states could leave, but individual parts of them couldn't.

The_Circular_Ruins,,,"That paper is from '91. More recent papers, mostly from western Europe, assign about a quarter of the difference in age at death to biological factors and the rest to behavioural factors, among which smoking is a large contributor. [Ex. from 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4529900/):
&gt;An important health-related behaviour with a clear impact on sex differences in mortality is smoking (e.g., [3, 5, 7, 18–21]). Although estimates of the contribution of smoking vary according to the time period and the country studied, McCartney et al. recently estimated that smoking-related causes of death explained 40%–60% of the gender gap in all-cause mortality in Europe in 2003–2005 [5]. Similarly, based on an analysis of 44 European countries over the period 1950/55 to 2005/2009, Luy and Wegner-Siegmundt showed that smoking explained on average more than 40% of the sex difference in life expectancy in 21 of these countries, most of them in western Europe [7].

I don't think the question is settled, because as I recall US data is more equivocal. I was left with the impression that since one of the main avenues smoking exerts its morbidity/mortality effects is through cardiovascular disease, if smoking  contributes proportionally more to heart disease in Europe but is only one of several causes in the US, that might account for the differential significance.

finnylicious,,,"That's a gross and ridiculous oversimplification of an extremely complicated conflict. 

I studied the Spanish Civil War, and just dumbing it down to ''fascists bad, antifascists good'' is insane.  
The Spanish Civil War was decades in the making, and was the confluent conflict of dozens of groups, both left and right wing.

The war wasn't just the left vs the right, there was warring in the streets where anti-fascist leftist groups were killing other anti-fascist leftist groups.  
Communists were lining other communists up against walls and executing them via firing squad because they weren't the right kind of communists.  
The communist militias would take over towns and villages, kill the rich, and make life hell for the civilians who didn't aually want to live under a communist regime. 

Despite the revolutionary romanticism of writers like Orwell and Hemingway, many peasant spanish welcomed the fascists with open arms. 

The Andalucians, especially, who were poor to begin with and couldn't comfortably sustain any kind of socialist economy like the wealhier northern nations could, were very welcoming of the fascists bringing order and taking out the left wing groups that had been waging war in the streets with one-another.. 

There is a legitimate case to be made, and many Spanish Civil War historians have made it, that, much like Pinochet in Chile, the Franco regime was the best of a bad lot.  
This isn't at all to say that Franco was good for Spain, only that he provided the country with a structure and stability that stopped it collapsing into feudalism. 

This Catalan referendum is very much a remnant of the left-wing feudalism of the civil war.

Also, with regards to you blaming fascism itself for spain being less developed than other European nations, there is no reason to think a communist regime would have retarded the nation's development any less.  
In fact, as we've seen from history, fascist regimes often provide a nation with far more room to develop than communist nations ever could. Fascist dictators have pulled their nations out of abject poverty thanks to the raw structure they provide.

It's really weird!

And...come to think of it, aren't a lot of European nations of the same mindset? Isn't this the kind of politics that Merkel won another term through?

Rubikia,artist,,"Weird World is our world with several things slightly…weird. In the year 1904, the Sino-Russian War broke out. Though mostly a land war, the Russian Empire began to send its navy west from their Baltic ports towards the Qing Empire. They feared an imminent Chinese attack using ships they bought from the British. On their journey across the North Sea the Russians encountered a British Trawler fleet and mistook them for the Chinese their feared. They  opened fire, killing 3 British fishermen. Outraged by the incident as well as the Russian interest in Tibet (the British thought this was a factor for the Sino-Russian War), Britain declares war on Russia with huge public support. Britain allies with Qing Empire in order to protect Tibet and India from the Russian bear. However, Russia called in their ally France in order to help them in the war in Europe.

Germany, being currently at war with France (and Russia but they were busy with China), decides to ally with Britain. The sick man of Europe, the Ottoman Empire, was secretly asked by France to close the Suez Strait to stop aid going to India, allowing Russia to invade. The Ottomans refused, however the telegram was discovered. This prompted Britain to declare war against the Ottomans, as in Weird World, the British Empire is insanely protective about the riches of India. The added bonus of war with the Ottomans was that the British could finally gain control the Suez Strait themselves.

So a small car of 40 sq ft has to get 43 mpg while a truck with a footprint of 75 sq ft can get away with 23 mpg. The scaling has been made such that the smaller you go, the more incredibly difficult it becomes to comply. This is why automakers are pumping out great big crossovers nonstop, because the scaling favors big fat vehicles. This is why ford phased out the ford ranger, which was immensely popular, because it simply wouldn't meet the emissions requirements while a larger, less efficient vehicle would. Ironically, cafe is actually encouraging everyone to drive bigger, less efficient vehicles. European emission laws are different, so small diesels thrive over there and bigger diesels are stringently controlled. Anyways, by now your eyes have probably glazed over, but these laws are so biased that most european diesel manufacturers don't even try to comply with north american laws, because they are designed to be impossible to comply with.

1996 was the post Masstricht period where a sense of being European was probably at its strongest (ERM excepted). It would have passed in all likelihood and as such there was little point in holding it in lieu of the disruption it would have caused.

The tipping point really began in 2004 with the ascension of the A8 countries which opened up an inflammatory narrative which hadn't been there to the same extent previously, and which would ultimately come to usurp economics as the pivot.

slcrook,,,"Germany, and France, in fact many Continental powers with the means to do so practiced similar forms of National Service- that is compulsory military service- in the decades leading up to the First World War.

I'm going to generalise, a wee bit, but it makes for easier reading.

Essentially all fit young men were eligible to be called up, and depending on which country and at which time this might be a wide net for everyone, or a lottery system of calling up groups assigned particular draft numbers.  It was more typical to lean towards more rather than less in this type of levee. 

The conscript would be obliged to serve a term, not too long, not often more than three years, and frequently less, as a full-time soldier, trained, equipped and prepared to deploy if required.

After this term of service, the man would release back to being a civilian, and go on with whatever it is that meant for him, with the added obligation for the next several decades he either is a part of the army's active reserve- men who train part-time and are among the first to be brought into active service to supplement the regular forces; later, as he aged, the man would be on a list of 'supplemental reserves.'  This meant that he was no longer obligated to turn out for training exercises, but was still liable to be called for active service, if need be.

What this meant is that the huge power blocs which had formed in Europe in the last half of the Nineteenth Century had a very wide pool of manpower to pull from.  It's an insta-bake army, if you will.  

That, in and of itself, was part of the overtly militarised deterrent for rival factions to go to war, as neither was substantially stronger than another. (Yes, Russia, being with France had a seemingly inexhaustible supply of manpower, but that was generally discounted as an immediate threat. Putting the Tsar's troops in order was going to take so long that it was expected France would fall before Russia could really get going)

Now, men such as these chaps in the photograph, being that they are in a fraternity are very likely college students, and are just as likely to be part of a reserve units or an officer training program.  All things military were incredibly fashionable in the years leading up to the war.  

A general consensus was that the delicate balance of power would be caused to shift one way or the next and, particular for Germany and France either finish what the Prussians had begun in 1870, or, take revenge and land back that were ceded to Prussia (and thence Germany), the Kaiser was involved in an extensive naval ship-building race with Britain, local conflicts in the Balkans and in regards to overseas territories constantly threatened to dispose of a very tense peace.  Young men everywhere became very fond of military fashions, and it was more usual to spend time in the armed forces than to not.

The only notable exception to this system of universal service was Great Britain.  Being an island, and having global naval supremacy- the Empire in it's heyday in the late years of Victoria.  Popular thinking was that the navy was sufficient for home defense- the enemy can't conquer what he cannot invade- so the need to have large numbers of men under arms for this purpose was redundant.  

The British Army at the time was a very small force whose regular troops were career soldiers- men with ambitions to serve twenty years or more.  These men were used, on a rotational basis, to provide garrison troops to various parts of the Empire, and were supplemented by a very small voluntary (so voluntary that they could not be compelled to serve overseas) reserve known as the Territorial Army.

It is beyond very little doubt that these young men in the photograph would have seen service in the war.

I can't speak for the Kenyans or the Irish, but India's cordial relations with Britain are predicated on the firm assumption that no foreigner will ever rule India again. Anti-colonial sentiment is still quite strong in the country, particularly with the nationalist right. When Sonia Gandhi seemed poised to become Prime Minister in the early 2000's, she was forced to back down and hand the position to Manmohan Singh because right-wingers threatened to burn themselves in the streets before they'd let a foreigner run the country (Sonia Gandhi is a white woman from Italy who married into the Gandhi family decades ago and has been an Indian citizen for most of her life).

There are many other countries where anti-colonial sentiment regularly takes the form of racial demagoguery. Latin American leftists organize around anti-colonial messages that explicitly target racial groups, not just ethnic Spaniards or Portuguese but also the Arabs, Turks and Levantines who wield disproportionate economic and political power in South America and often look like Europeans. Calls for violence are common.

Kier_C,,,"&gt; What does it mean ""crazy high""? Is that a problem? And for whom? Golden age of post-war capitalism was in the era of very high taxation. I don't see a problem with high taxes.

Post-war era was a pretty unique set of circumstances, it doesnt follow over the long haul.

&gt; Please read some of the Ha-Joon Chang's books like ""Bad Samaritans"" or ""23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism"" because you seem to believe economy is one-dimensional and there is one perfect recipe. China was first of all a country that was backwards technologically and simply acquired technologies by various partnerships with foreign companies, and what they didn't buy they stole and the rest was compensated by extremely low labor cost and willingness of Chinese people to work for 12 hours a day. Chinese market is not free by any means, unless you mean there are no labor rights or protections. Capital controls are very well in place and party gives directions to companies through various several-year long plans. Yes, China benefited from a small dose of capitalism because they were far too left in terms of government control but in EU the problem is the opposite, which is complete lack of control. You should maybe read about Botswana or other countries that rejected harsh free-market directives from IMF and achieved success exactly because of that.

I dont believe capatilism is 1 dimensional. Its a little hard to get an economic thesis across in a reddit comment. You arent giving capatilism enough credit in china. Equally you are saying that one of the richest places on the planet has been been taken down by capitalism which equally doesnt make sense.

&gt; Oh well, in the past people had to take a shit outside, I guess no one should complain about modern-day exploitation... That's not an argument.

No its not an argument. Equally its not my argument. Im just not sure if you are purposely ignoring it or just missing the point. The living standards of today and the poverty of today is not a fraction of what it once was. This has been driven by the improvements in the economies driven by capitalism. Exploitation is a different thing entirely... 

&gt; More people are better off now than ever before. The poverty line is relative and moves upwards as the country improves.
&gt; http://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/FromMay2014/laknerfig1_2.png
&gt; Nope, not everyone is better off. This is global distribution so it means that on the far right you have richest people - for them last 2 or 3 decades were great. On the center and left you have people in developing countries - they are improving too. Do you see the huge dip on the right? It's European and American middle class - they are getting fucked hard. They get almost nothing in comparison. As I said, this is not sustainable and that's why you have strange political decisions like Trump election, Brexit, or Front National surging in polls. People see that corporations are getting richer, the wealthiest are getting richer and they get nothing. So, no, not everyone receives the benefits, I need you to understand that, because otherwise the whole discussion is pointless.

I know everyone hasn't benefited. The world is changing and anytime the world changes some people end up worse off. There is the rust belt in the US and there are the traditional mining towns in the UK as two obvious examples. As the economy has moved towards high tech area it has fucked them incredibly hard (though we have moved slightly off topic). This has happend numerous times over the last many generations, the motor car screwed the blacksmith.

&gt; Work that barely gets you by is not part of this issue.
&gt; Of course it is.

Its off topic, we're talking about corporate tax not government policy on minimum wage, or working conditions, or work hours etc.

&gt; The presence of these companies (and their ability to reinvest their income) spurrs the economy and increases all the other tax revenues as well. It increases the availability of jobs and the companies competitiveness on a global scale.
&gt; You just keep repeating it like a bot, honestly. Nobody cares about competitiveness that comes from labor exploitation.

You keep ignoring that point without really understanding it. Competitiveness comes from many areas, exploitation of labor is something business tries but with proper regulation shouldnt be allowed. I dont know what industry you work in but surely you can think of things you are doing to be more competitive, make the product better and move into new areas. I can think of plenty in what I do. If the only thing you can think of is your boss screwing you over can I suggest looking for a better company to work for?

&gt; On a side note, the main shareholders in these companies are pension funds. These funds are what pay the normal people retirement incomes. A poor performance of these funds speed up the decline of the main social system issue - funding pensions for an ageing population.
&gt; Pension funds require a reform anyways, age distribution is vastly different than they were designed. Nowadays retirees in developed countries can enjoy their life while the young have bleak perspectives.

I dont think you understand how serious the pension thing is! Moving out the retirement age by a few years isnt going to solve it. Equally having people work till they physically cant anymore doesnt sound too appealing. You are the one who keeps talking about exploitation, Im surprised this is the line you are taking on pensions.

WikiTextBot,,,"**Earthquake bomb**

The earthquake bomb, or seismic bomb, was a concept that was invented by the British aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis early in World War II and subsequently developed and used during the war against strategic targets in Europe. A seismic bomb differs somewhat in concept from traditional bombs, which usually explode at or near the surface, and destroy their target directly by explosive force. In contrast, a seismic bomb is dropped from high altitude to attain very high speed as it falls and upon impact, penetrates and explodes deep underground, causing massive caverns or craters known as camouflets, as well as intense shockwaves. In this way, the seismic bomb can affect targets that are too massive to be affected by a conventional bomb, as well as damage or destroy difficult targets such as bridges and viaducts.

Naten_,3-dabsquid,Dab!,"&gt;You say outdated values while christianity as a religion has those. Like we are some of a fucking shining example.

You are correct. Do correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't know of any Christian countries that include Christian laws in their justice systems, and that is to me the most important. However, in many Middle Eastern Islamic countries, Islamic religious law (Sharia) is used in their justice system. For example, in the [constitution of Syria](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Syria_2012.pdf?lang=en), title 1, chapter 1, article 3 is read as the following:

    The religion of the President of the Republic is Islam; Islamic jurisprudence shall be a
    major source of legislation; The State shall respect all religions, and ensure the
    freedom to perform all the rituals that do not prejudice public order; The personal
    status of religious communities shall be protected and respected.    

The most important part here is ""Islamic jurisprudence shall be a major source of legislation."" Also, in Syrian Sharia courts, a man's testimony is worth twice as much as that of a woman's.

(Even though it also says that ""The State shall respect all religions,"" [freedom of religion in Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_Syria) is debatable.)

Following Islamic religious law also inevitably leads to issues such as [LGBT rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Syria).

The Guardian is pretty left-leaning, and even they have published articles that reference ""Sharia Police"" or ""Sharia Patrols"" in Europe, which is what I meant.

gorgich,ru-ast,Astrakhan,"Sochi and other resort towns on the Black Sea coast in Krasnodar Krai are among the most popular destinations for all Russians. During the last years many Russians go to Crimea too, if you count it as a part of Russia.

Lake Baikal and Altai mountains are popular among people who live in larger Siberian cities like Novosibirsk and Krasnoyarsk. 

Many, although not all, Russians go to Moscow and Saint Petersburg at least once in their life and sometimes much more often. 

St Petersburgers often go to the Republic of Karelia which has awesome lakes, rivers and cliffs.

The historic towns of the Golden Ring must be quite popular among Muscovites, I believe.

People from Astrakhan tend to go to Volgograd, Rostov-on-Don and the Republic of Kalmykia among other destinations.

First of all, saying that the EU is a dictatorship is just plain out wrong. There is a parliament with representatives from each country that have been chosen by the people, there's a council with representatives from each country's government and there is a comission filled by bureaucrats and all of these three parts of the EU are equal, so there's no one all-powerful leader, which is literally the definition of a dictatorship.
 So just from the evidence of a parliament existing, we can prove that the EU does actually care about the democratic will, because if they didn't, why would the parliament have equal power, if not more since they decide on all the issues whilst the comission just propose then, to the bureaucrats? What's also great is that if you want to leave the EU, you can, which also proves the EU acknowledging the will of the people.

The Phrygian cap is a soft conical cap with the top pulled forward, associated in antiquity with several peoples in Eastern Europe and Anatolia, including Phrygia, Dacia, and the Balkans. In early modern Europe it came to signify freedom and the pursuit of liberty through a confusion with the pileus, the felt cap of manumitted (emancipated) slaves of ancient Rome. Accordingly, the Phrygian cap sometimes is called a liberty cap; in artistic representations it signifies freedom and the pursuit of liberty.

It is used in the coat of arms of certain Republics or of republican State institutions in the place where otherwise a Crown would be used (in the heraldry of monarchies).

Did Drumpf tell you that? 

In some countries across Europe cops don't even have a pistol, they just get a taser and pepper spray or something like that. 

The only ones with machine guns are the military, usually. They get deployed if there are any extreme circumstances, like a terror act, a very high profile state visit or something similar. Normally you don't really see them.

Gradz45,,," Everyone knows the effect a strong leader and commanding presence has on a person. It's called the Milgram experiment, people will override their own moral concerns to an extent if they're being told what to do by an authoritative figure. Nazi Germany was a country steeped in a Europe with centuries of anti-semitism at a time when Eugenics was regarded as good and Hitler appealed to the anger of a humiliated broken people after the harsh penalties of WW1 and won much support by presenting a solution. 

I've studied history for the last five years academically I'm well aware of the pitfalls of mankind and our horrendous potential I don't need some elementary lesson of everyone can be bad and are complicated. No shit. I learned that lesson years ago. 

But let's not pretend you or Peterson are some great minds for figuring that out. Just to be clear I didn't say you agreed with them or advocated their shit, but you say you want to learn something from what they did great we should, but saying that everyone has the potential to do it means nothing by itself. If we wish to avoid the Holocaust, Rwanda, the inquisition we have to understand that yeah they're people like you and me and cultural and historical context is key in allowing such a hate to exist, but that's why comments like everyone is capable of it piss me off so much. 

Yes everyone is and we should study the elements that created an environment for Nazism, but to me saying everyone is capable of it undermines wanting to change it. In the sense that everyone is, but we should through studying the mistakes of the past and ourselves work to create a world where it's not human because I think that as long as we accept the reality of it I believe we're just continuing the inevitability of such views becoming strong enough to effect change in a detrimental way. Because I believe that saying they're people and everyone is capable of it negates the true awfulness of what they did, intentional or not (and I don't think it was in this case). They may have been people, but to their victims they were monsters. 

That and I honestly believe that's an extremely pessimistic view of humanity, people have and will always do terrible things, but we've also done great things and while given the right circumstances everyone can be an accomplice in genocide, that means the opposite as well.

SKT was going to win against everyone, except they boosted FW once with a lose against them. Worlds is battle between 3 teams when there is a Korean in your group. SKT should have gone 6-0 in their group. Korea just has a weird problem with Taiwan. IMay was never going to beat SKT.

&gt;Finishing first means that you don't have to play SSG in the quarters.

Yeah it means they don't have to play a Korean, but they only had a 1/3 chance of getting Nox. They could have got C9 or RNG instead. C9 also had to beat IMay and FW to get second seed. That is a comparable hard task as beating EDG, AHQ, and BT. AHQ and BT are free wins. 

It gets tiring arguing this over and over. All H2K had to do to show the world that they were the best western team was just take 2 games off of SSG. They couldn't even take 1.

ZardozSpeaks,,,"&gt;A PHOTO NEGATIVE of the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. Quite a supernatural object, considering that this is the one and only.

The biggest problem with this is the shroud shows no distortion from being wrapped around a body. It is flat as if it was a photographic image. That alone is extraordinarily problematic.

&gt;So it's very obvious a sample was taken from the area that was patched up in the middle ages.

No it's not. Patches are obvious and easily avoided.

&gt;Let me counter this by giving the more compelling evidence that a botanist has studied the Shroud and concluded that the flowers were from Jerusalem and the pollen on it was dated to 2 thousand years old.

Citation, please.

&gt;There's no way a fraud in the dark ages could have left an imprint of the teeth and created a PHOTO NEGATIVE.

Actually, it's the easiest explanation ever. If the image were positive on a white cloth it would be invisible. The only solutions were to either dye the entire cloth a darker shade *except* for the image area (which is extremely difficult to do and likely impossible for the time), or paint a dark color on a light cloth.

Given that the image *is* like a photograph, in that it is flat and doesn't look at all like it was wrapped around a body, and that the ""negative"" look is the easiest of all for someone to create using pigments at the time, I'd say this is pretty strong evidence that this is a fake.

I wanted to further imply that the Catalan independence referendum is bourgeois, since it isn't truly about 'self-determination' (and even if it was, it would be bourgeois self-determination) since they would be subject to the institutions of the neoliberal bourgeois European Union.

&gt;I have been there since the opening of the poll stations at 5am, and bourgeous are last thing I have seen.

It doesn't matter that you haven't seen any bourgeoisie voting (I mean they're probably in their boardrooms exploiting the workers!), the Catalan bourgeoisie support it. Therefore there is no class-character or class-struggle to this independence movement, it is class-collaboration.

&gt;But if you are seeking for a proletariat revolution-referendum in middle of an EU ruled by the EPP good luck, you will need it.

Well, I would like this to happen, but I am under no illusions that a revolution of the proletariat is unlikely to spontaneously happen in the coming days. My issue is that socialists supporting a right-wing campaign because it is anti-Spanish government and because 'national self-determination' is worrying, and the better thing to do would be to steer the proletariat away from this false choice and against capital as a whole.

&gt;proletariat revolution-referendum

lol

&gt;That's why we get support from the anticapitalist left from all over Spain while spanish fascist parties are travelling to Catalonia to get violence?

Maybe the anticapitalist left aren't so anticapitalist and are opportunistic social democrats? I don't know I haven't been to Spain. Either way, IMO they're doing this wrongly, independent Catalonia won't accelerate proletarian struggle or strike a blow to global capitalism, it will only advocate for their collaboration with rich bourgeois who don't want to pay taxes to the poorer parts of Spain.

TruthSpeaker,,,"I'm sorry. but you are allowing your prejudices to blind you to the truth.

Firstly, no one had a clue exactly what leaving meant because no country had ever done it before on this scale. Everything that was said at the time was pure speculation.

In the absence of hard facts and precedents that we could study, it was the easiest thing in the world for the leave campaign to present a lot of abstract ideas about multiple alternatives, each showing how wonderfully liberating it would be and how much money we would save.

There are several major things we have learnt since the vote that we were not told about.

For example, the huge divorce bill, the very real threat to peace in Northern Ireland, the impact on the car industry, the gumming up of the passage of goods through our borders, the impact on farmers, the loss of thousands of NHS workers who are returning to the EU, the impact on science and education, the impact on importers and exporters and so on and so forth.

Just look at the Bombardier deal. It's a sharp and painful reminder that international trade is a jungle and when we leave we are on our own. Sentiment and special relationships simply do not enter into the equation.

A recent survey of leave voters showed they had no idea how complex and time-consuming Brexit would be. Many of them thought we could just walk away from the EU the next month and head off into the glorious uplands.

No one had a clue how massively complex and time consuming the divorce process would be, nor how expensive the never-ending trade negotiations we now have to set up are going to be.

I talk to people about Brexit all the time and know that not a few of them were won over by the £350 million a week refund to the NHS.

That has been proven to be a massive and cynical lie.

So in June 2016 we voted in an information vacuum and also on the basis of blatant lies and half truths. 

Now that we have a better understanding of what Brexit entails we need to run it past the British people again.

This is a massive change to our country. Why would you want it to be forced through without the voters having a chance to reconsider it in the light of a whole galaxy of new information that was not available first time round?

Why would you want to do this when a significant majority of young people voted to remain and they are the ones who will have to live with the impact of Brexit for the longest period?

xvoxnihili,ROMA,Bromania,"&gt;I don’t want to interfere in the domestic issues of Spain but I absolutely condemn what happened today in Catalonia.
On one hand, the separatist parties went forward with a so-called referendum that was forbidden by the Constitutional Court, knowing all too well that only a minority would participate as 60 % of the Catalans are against separation.
And on the other hand - even when based on court decisions - the use of disproportionate violence to stop this.
In the European Union we try to find solutions through political dialogue and with respect for the constitutional order as enshrined in the Treaties, especially in art. 4.
It’s high time for de-escalation. Only a negotiated solution in which all political parties, including the opposition in the Catalan Parliament, are involved and with respect for the Constitutional and legal order of the country, is the way forward.

Guy Verhofstadt. Schultz said something similar as well.

&gt; The Scottish Parliament - which notably is dominated by a party that has called for the region&amp;#039;s independence from the U.K. - on Sept. 22 sent a letter to the Rajoy government expressing its &amp;quot;Grave concern over the escalating actions of the Spanish state in Catalonia.""

Then you have never looked upon a map before 1900, did you? Germany alone had more nations than all of Europe together has now.

&gt;All they need to claim independence is the fact that they're not Spanish.

Define that. Because you can make a point for a lot of regions within Europe and we'd had a hundred new nations if we give claims to all of those. And if you say they have a claim to be independent because they are not Spanish, then Spain has a claim to fight against that independence because at some point Spain incorporated their territory into its own and let any independent nation cease to exist, therefore giving a casus belli against everyone claiming that territory (in this case the Catalan government)

&gt;A claim to independence is not based around a single issue.

The_WFRP_Companion,darkblue,Graf von CSS,"It's actually really interesting it, and as someone who's ever so slowly rewriting the setting to be a fair bit more interesting with a lot more inspiration from history and a general refinement of the Fantasy elements or at least that's my aim, I don't think I'd considered in concrete terms exploring the difference between editions. 

In fact the material I had at times I usually saw as having problems that stemmed from the fact that it hadn't changed by editions. I think at least the World Map is a good example of something that should have been expanded but wasn't, and it limited the world pretty much literally. Ultimately my focus thus far has been on general history, setting up the swathes of new nations in convincing ways and making sure their inclusion is valuable, with only pinpoint focus so far on the Reik and the Dwarfs. So I hadn't thought massively about Bretonnia until about now except in broadstrokes.

Your points are largely something I agree with, and I've focused a lot on drawing out and categorising how European socieities developed during the period and obviously Bretonnia doesn't fit well. Rather than changing Bretonnia though my solution has been to rework it all, after all each part of the setting should impact the other parts. I think Sylvania is a great example; it's a cool but the idea that it could exist in this vacuum right in the middle of the Reik and not be immediately crushed, occupied, and cleansed feels silly to me. Why would you keep such a threat lurking, corruption and ""magic"" only work for so long. Another example might be just asking, ""why wouldn't the Reik's enemies just all end up attacking at once, independtly, seeing it already weakened and not just follow on"". In that case I'd just straight say there's not enough humans to balance out the various fantastical threats.

For Bretonnia specifically I had at least a general idea that it would worth it to experience a civil war around the time of the Storm of Chaos, post-war environments are wonderful for creating such change, and it would also open up the French Revolution as a source of inspiration. It's something I'll have to share in more detail in future.

Would it make for an interesting blog post to maybe look at these past changes (not my updates ofc) in more depth? It's something I've sorely missed with my recent joining, and with lots of new players in bound I think it'd be worth sparking a discussion about questioning just how good the source material is lest it becomes set in stone for a while.

EDIT: And thinking about it these general questions are the reason why Total War: Warhammer really grates on me. Confining it to that tiny time period and not stretching it over hundreds of years just makes me ask, ""why hasn't this massive sweeping conquest happened before"". It doesn't help that any actual societal development over the Reik's history is so vague. Overall all the problems I have just get amplified by this simple thing.

That and it feels so often like only the minimal amount of effort went in, or even could go in with how little development time they got. I think the world map and sieges are good example; all the cities in the Empire look the exact same on the map despite their massive, unique differences like Talabheim's crater, Altdorf's great river, Middenheim's ulricsberg, and Nuln's canals and sewers. And how they play on the map? Identical, just weird looking cities that feel the same as they did in Medieval II. It doesn't even change between races, even the bloody Dwarfs who've lived under siege for centuries. Bagh, I'm getting off the point.

Culturally, the U.S. swung very left from as recently as 2008. In 2008, then candidate for US President in the Democrat party, Obama was a supporter of ""traditional marriage"" and favored civil unions for gay people. Could you imagine a Democrat candidate for dog catcher saying that today?

Indeed, Democrats are livid about Trump turning back transgender rules for the military that are less than a year old. We have a semi-nationalized health care system thanks to Obamacare.

&gt;  Actually, I don't even care if people are saying that it was unamerican because you have the right to say what you want

I also agree with the school having the right to drop the kid since I found out that it is a private school and they can do what they want.  If it were a public school I think it would be a little different.  My bigger point though is the way people like 'Wyle_E_Coyote73' (and even our President) are reacting, which is to say ""good, these people deserve to be punished, they were acting unamerican"".  It's just a really strange thing that these people who think true American's are the people that agree with them and everyone else is not a patriot and deserves whatever punishment they deem necessary.  That isn't an American principal and it scares me how many of these people are coming out and saying these things.  I really worry that these kind of people could eventually turn our country into a theocracy, because that is pretty much what they want (although they would deny that if you were to confront them with that point).  

I am for free speech and american values all the way, but somehow american values seems to perverted by the conservatives to mean their way of thinking is the only true american way and that anyone who doesn't agree with them is not a patriot.  It's really strange that they don't see the hypocrisy of their reasoning.  Did they not take American history classes in elementary school?  Do they not remember why and how America came to be settled by europeans and why we fought to become a free nation?  They have every right to disagree with other's view points, but the fact that they think people having those opposing viewpoints makes those people unamerican is very scary to me.  

  I don't mean to just pick on the right-wingers either though, because plenty of liberals seem to be all for censorship of ""offensive"" speech.

5th_Law_of_Robotics,,,"&gt;[Jews control the majority of banking around the entire planet](https://europeanmediacentre.wordpress.com/2013/09/02/list-of-banks-owned-by-the-jewish-rothschild-family/).
&gt;
&gt;The Federal Reserve, which is actually a private bank with far, far, far too much control over our domestic economy and financial stability, was created and is still run by Jews. There have been non-Jew appointed heads of the Fed (rhyme, lol), but it's largely been under Jewish control since its creation. Not only that, but the Fed *has never been audited*, so there's no telling how much money is being laundered to foreign interests, or how much is being hoarded by select individuals.
&gt;
&gt;ETA: I think that it's worth noting here that before WWII, Poland was well aware of the risks of Jewish involvement in finance due to Jewish doctrine that encourages and espouses lying and cheating if it's in the interest of advancing or preserving the Jewish population, and there were laws prohibiting Jews from getting involved in finance in Poland.
&gt;
&gt;If you have time, look into the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It's a Jewish-run multinational entity that launders money between nations with no oversight to speak of.
&gt;
&gt;On top of that, the Fed - which again, was created by Jews - was designed to intentionally destabilize American currency. Until FDR passed the Federal Reserve Act in 1933, American currency was on what's called the **gold standard**, which meant that every cent was backed by physical gold. This is *really good*, because it means that our money always had real, material value, as gold is a universally valuable commodity. Thanks to the Federal Reserve and FDR, [our currency was taken off the gold standard and the government started forcibly seizing private citizens' gold reserves](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fdr-takes-united-states-off-gold-standard).
&gt;
&gt;Now, why would the government pass a law criminalizing the possession of non-decorative gold? Even if the United States were to devolve into a smoking hole of anarchy, gold is still incredibly valuable. You can still sell it for goods and services, even at a global scale. It wasn't until 1975 that Richard Nixon finally killed the legislation controlling gold bullion, allowing Americans to buy gold again.
&gt;
&gt;We never went back to the gold standard, though. There isn't enough gold to accommodate the total amount of US currency in circulation *and being hoarded offshore in tax havens*, but we could go back to a rare metals standard of palladium, gold, and silver. As it stands, our money is worthless. It's literally worthless - if the United States collapses, our money is worth nothing, and because it's backed by nothing, we are left with nothing to use as currency, even if we want to obtain supplies from other nations.
&gt;
&gt;Our economy is very fragile explicitly because our currency is not backed by any universally valuable commodity. And that is a direct result of Jewish interference in the US economy and banking system.

Modern history, the modern period or the modern era, is the global historiographical approach to the timeframe after post-classical history. Modern history can be further broken down into periods:

The early modern period began approximately in the early 16th century; notable historical milestones included the European Renaissance and the Age of Discovery.

The late modern period began approximately in the mid-18th century; notable historical milestones included the French Revolution, the American Revolution, the Industrial Revolution and the Great Divergence. It took all of human history up to 1804 for the world's population to reach 1 billion; the next billion came just over a century later, in 1927.

helmia,FINL,Finland,"&gt;I just meant that Poland and Finland have limitations and not on-demand abortions


What, what limitations? You apparently read my text,said that you were alluding the same and now you say Finland has ""limitations""?


Finland _doesn't_ have ""limitations"" and isn't even remotely close to Poland what comes to abortion legislation. Did you understand what I meant with our social reasons? That is what you would call ""on-demand""-abortion (are you Irish btw?), meaning what counts is the woman's own opinion that she doesn't want to continue the pregnancy. The doctor _doesn't_ have the right to deny an abortion, it is only a discussion and that's it, then you continue to the abortion.

0ed,,2∆,"In my defence, those immutable laws which I described weren't just products of my imagination; in fact, they already exist, and arguably have existed for over two milleniae in various forms.  They are human rights.

If you live in a first world country (and I assume you do) you already enjoy a number of rights that guarantee a bare minimum of quality of life.  These rights can be further protected by international treaties as is the case in Europe, where the European Convention on Human Rights decided a bare minimum of rights which must be accorded to every single individual - with the result that any legislation deemed to conflict with those rights will have to be redrafted to satisfy the content of the ECHR.  Any individual who deems that their rights are infringed upon has the right to bring their case to the European Court.

There is no need to vote for that, being as it already exists.  However, even in countries where there is no such international treaty to safeguard their rights, many people would often find it comfortable to vote for such human rights act even if it works mathematically against their own self interest.  The reason that we might buy into these acts, is the same reason for which we may buy insurance.  If we do the math, we can also work out that what we're paying for is greater than the risks that we actually face.  But we continue to buy insurance not because we expect to profit mathematically, but because we find value in the additional peace of mind we gain from the insurance policy.  In the same way we gain peace of mind from the insurance of human rights, which is why we tend by and large to support the idea of basic rights accorded to every human being.  There are other reasons of course, but that's just a simpler one.

As for your question as to what greed I refer to, it is a human greed.  Greed is not something unique to the upper, middle, or lower income groups.  Every group, and every individual, fights for their own self interest to some extent or another.  It is not up to us to condemn the middle class for wanting access to free, or cheaper, higher education.  But it is for us to examine why they want this higher education to be free.  Is it truly because they believe that having a free higher education system would allow the people on the lowest income brackets to study alongside them in limited college spaces?  Or is it because they know that even with free tuition, people on lower income brackets have a worse chance of getting into college than the middle class do?

The example which I used with college was not meant to demonize the middle class.  It was supposed to show how even supposedly altruistic policies, popular with the middle class allegedly because it eliminates inequality, is in fact not as altruistic as it seems.

The fundamental design of a democratic system makes for truly altruistic policies benefitting a minority group extremely difficult.  I'm not going to say it's completely impossible - because you may get a politician who doesn't care about his career, or a group of truly altruistic voters who possess the remarkable foresight required to pass policies on the behalf of a minority.  But these scenarios are not likely.  

You might argue that the legalization of gay marriage is an example to the contrary - but I would argue that it is a special case where the rights of a minority may be defended at little to no cost to the majority.  It was a case wherein benefits could be conferred on a minority at no cost to the majority - and look at how long it took to accomplish even that!

In cases where the majority has something to lose for the minority to gain, the democratic process will crush any hope for the minority.  Any claimed altruistic movements will fall under Director's Law and continue to confer benefits to a majority rather than to the nominal intended recipients.

In short, I just don't believe that there is room for altruism in a democracy.  Altruism, even when it is present, and even when it isn't misguided, will very often be taken advantage of to pass policies which confer no benefits to those they claim to help.  This is a fundamental flaw in the system of government that cannot be changed by voting against one's self interest, which at best changes nothing, and at worst enables a politician with policies benefitting no class but his own to become elected on the false premise of altruism.",True,0,1506881587,,False,0,dnrjry0,False,t3_73gucm,t1_dnrhz36,/r/changemyview/comments/73gucm/cmv_in_100_years_the_current_republican_party/dnrjry0/,1509210350,2,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,

Chartis,,,"
&gt;GEORGE: Senator thanks for joining us again this morning.  
&gt;BERNIE: Good to be with you.   

&gt;GEORGE: Well you just heard Secretary Mnuchin right. They say the goal is no tax cuts for the wealthy, huge benefits for the middle class and projected a cut in the deficit of about a trillion dollars over the next ten years. You ready to sign on?  
&gt;BERNIE: Hahaha! Not quite George. I mean I think everything he said is dead wrong. No tax breaks for the rich. They are repealing the estate tax. The Estate Tax only applies to the top 2/10ths of 1%. Millionaires and billionaires like the Walton family of Walmart, like the Koch brothers family, like the Trump family. $269 billion dollars in tax breaks for the top 2/10ths of 1% over the next ten years. This is not a tax break for the rich? Well I don’t know what a tax break for the rich is. The Tax Policy Institute in fact has estimated based on the information they now have that at the end of 10 years 80%, eight zero percent, of all of the tax benefits go the top 1%. Further, in the midst of all this stuff, there is a $450 billion dollar cut in Medicare. Now you may remember that when Trump ran for President, he promised working families ‘oh, he’s not gonna cut Medicare, he’s not gonna cut Medicaid’. A trillion dollar cut in Medicaid, $450 billion dollar cut in Medicare. What this is is a massive transfer of wealth. It’s the Robin Hood principle in reverse. He’s taking from working families and low income people and giving it to the super rich, AND creating a $1.5 trillion dollar deficit at the end of 10 years.   

&gt;GEORGE: As you know the President is actively quoting Democrats. He appeared in Indiana with Senator Joe Donnelly, this week Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia. All of them are up in 2018. If a Democrat votes, if a Democratic Senator votes for this bill will you support a primary challenge?  
&gt;BERNIE: Look the issue is I would hope that Democrats from one end of this country to the other would be fighting this proposal. This is not politics George, this is just really bad policy. And I’m not clear why anybody would support a proposal which gives massive amounts of tax breaks to the people who don’t need it at a time of incredible income and wealth inequality in America. If anything, right now, what we must be demanding is that the wealthiest people in this country start finally paying their fair share of taxes, they don’t need more tax breaks.   

&gt;GEORGE: What would that be? What should the top rate be?  
&gt;BERNIE: Well that’s something we have to work on. But when you have the 1/10th of 1% now owning almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%, it is very clear to me that the wealthiest people in this country have got to start paying their fair share of taxes. You got major corporations making billions of dollars a year in profit stashing their profits in the Cayman Islands, and in Bermuda and at the end of the year not paying one nickel in federal taxes. That has got to change.  

&gt;GEORGE: Any tax cuts you would support right now?  
&gt;BERNIE: Well I think we got to focus on the needs of the middle class and working families of this country. Those are the people who need help. Not the top 1%.  

&gt;GEORGE: What would that mean?  
&gt;BERNIE: Well I think you can raise the Standard Deduction. I think what Trump was talking about is right but he gives with one hand and he takes away with the other by repealing the Personal Exemption. We also need to expand the Earned Income tax credit to help working families. So there’s a lot that can be done. But bottom line is when you have massive income and wealth inequality, when the rich are getting richer and most Americans are getting poorer you don’t give tax breaks to billionaires, you give tax breaks to the people in need.   

&gt;GEORGE: You’ve got more than a dozen Democrats now supporting your Medicare for All plan in the Senate. You’re campaigning hard all across the country, two quick questions: How do you respond to those who say you’re pulling your Party too far to the left, and is it fair to say given your activities, you’re not ruling out another run for President in 2020?  
&gt;BERNIE: Well let me just say that the idea of a Medicare for All, the idea that the United States of America to join every other major country on Earth in guaranteeing health care to every man woman and child, this is not a radical idea. In fact, poll after poll shows a majority of the American people support that idea. People want to know why as a nation, George, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of Canada or many of the European countries while our health care outcomes are not necessarily as good. And people also want to know why we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. So I don’t see this as a radical idea. I see it as an idea that more and more people want. Medicare today is a very popular program, it’s *the* most popular health insurance program in the country. Lets expand it to everybody over a four year period.

dissenter92,,,"The US winner-take-all political system prevents fringe groups from obtaining any meaningful positions of power. Your analogy is perfect as to trying to relate this to something happening in the US. However, it would never be possible for reasons strictly related to the parlamentary mechanism under which most of Europe functions.

For example, The Texas Nationalist Movement calls for ""the complete, total and unencumbered political, cultural and economic independence of Texas"". If you substitute Texas for Catalonia you have the exact same mission statement from the CUP, the local independence Catalonian party. However, under no circumstances in Texas would a small group of people find themselves with the power to organize a referendum.

The CUP gathered about 330.000 votes. In a region of 7.5M people that is not such a significant result. Moreover, during the previous election cycle the very same group did not manage to get more than 120.000 votes, but the financial crisis generated a ""fuck-it"" sort of environment that transfered votes to anyone other than those in power.

The CUP has delivered, and has indeed proposed all sorts of ""fuck-the-sytem"" measures. Just for kicks, here is the news where their proposal to nationalize the cathedral and convert it into a farmers market failed to obtain sufficient votes (any at all) in the Catalonian parlament.

http://www.europapress.es/catalunya/noticia-cup-barcelona-pide-expropiar-catedral-abrir-economato-escuela-musica-20170704193517.html

Indeed this would have made a bitchin´ farmers market, but since it had zero chances of going anywhere you might get an idea of how time gets to be spent now at the Catalonian parlament.

Now, imagine however that one day you wake up in Texas and the governor´s mansion is occupied by the TNM. He has the resources of the state, the ability to mandate state police to do whatever they want, and the ultimate power to dictate exceptional measures. The governor realizes that this was a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity and calls for a referendum to leave the US. What would the federal government do?

Mind you, Texas is in a great position to do this because of the special conditions in which it joined the union, but you still cannot just do whatever you want. I mean you can, but it does not mean the rest of the states are going to idly watch the show, particularly when there is a mutually-agreed-upon constitution that describes how things happen in the system, and at no time anyone agreed that unilateral withdrawal was an option.

Compound that with the fact that a sizable portion of the population feels that they despite their Texan identity they also feel Americans, and they do not want to leave the union. What is the federal government to do? Didn´t the American Civil War start when the southern states decided to take their toys and go home?

The response the Spanish government has given may be better or worse, but it has been consistent. The pictures are dramatic. The plight (""We just want to vote"") a smart one. The cause sympathetic, but what hides here is precisely the tirany of the majorities (and minorities) that the founding fathers tried to prevent with so many tools. The 60-majority rules for the senate, the limited power of the presidency, the checks and balances of Congress, and so many others that, unfortunately, are being slowly eroded.

Ultimately, this is a prime example of how proportional parlamentary systems can easily fall prey to fringe minorities. Had the mainstream Catalonian party not been badly beaten by corruption and financial scandals they would not have lost their majority and find themselves forced to seek a majority with the CUP.

The CUP knows they would never have another chance like this. Puigdemont -the current Catalonian president- knows his political future is over. And so, we find ourselves inside the bank, with all the money in our hands, but unable to spend it because we are surrounded by the police and we have killed three hostages. What is left? A suicide-by-cop. A unilateral declaration of independence that will go as far as the proposal to convert the cathedral into a farmers market, but will assure them a place in history.",True,0,1506882619,,False,0,dnrkr9a,False,t3_73kqqo,t1_dnr3f1q,/r/worldnews/comments/73kqqo/catalan_referendum_riot_police_fire_rubber/dnrkr9a/,1509210887,1,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,

privadoto,eu g2,,"DUDE! You are the man, anyone half smart can understand this as soon as they read both letters from H2k. As you said - It's absurd.

Do they keep writing and telling people ""We are so proud of what we have done with our brand, our partners and whatnot"" Are you fucking serious right now H2k? How can you have the balls to even say that? I just don't understand how can someone be that blind...

No H2k, you haven't done a good or even a ""decent"" job branding your team/club, no you haven't done the same thing regarding sponsors, YOU HAVEN'T. Look at their sponsors and tell me if that's even half decent LOL... I can tell you right now that perhaps maybe 1 sponsor there is willing or currently paying more than 350k-500k per year and MOST of that money is going towards that ridiculous management team, staff and god know what. I can guarantee you this, 100% sure. 

Then, of course, they have one of the best teams in EU, so their player salaries are ranging between $9,000 to $11,000 per month which is = $750,000 per year. Fine, might seem big enough to you and to us that perhaps have never dealt with this amount of money but for a club/org, especially already established and with a pretty decent fanbase, you do the math. Is it that costly? 

If you have done your job right, if you are good at what you do, if you have the right people working around the clock, how come you can't find close or even more than $1,000,000 per year? Sure, you might not generate that much revenue, if any. But we are ""starting"", Basketball, Football and so on didn't fully develop in 10 years, it took them close to 50 years. So hold the fuck down, you greedy fuckers lol, right? 

In my opinion, we will only reach some of those levels by 2020, perhaps 2021. People don't understand that some of the biggest brands don't even know what esports is, or if they know they don't have the right people behind them doing the research, investing time and money, they just don't care, right? They say ""For us, it's not important"" - We need to wait, someone who comes in and decides to invest in esports, they are doing it because THEY KNOW that this is and will be the future of entertainment, they are not looking to make any money in such short-term, they are looking towards the future, a future which will include billions and billions of dollars/euros. 

Also, one of the biggest issues of all of this situation is that people (either tournament organizers or game developers (Riot Games, Blizzard, etc...) haven't sold the rights to the games to any channel or something like that (Riot did with BAMTECH or whatever is their name) but still, you get my point? If anyone here understands European football, you know that every single national league gets a flat % of the TV rights, so let's say that for the Premier League, for the next season they will have a $500M from TV rights, they will distribute those $500M between all of the teams in the league, of course, that the top 6 will receive more, a lot more than the middle table and bottom, right? It's simple and that money is a huge help for most teams but I can guarantee you that it's not close of what each team spends in a season. 

Now, H2k is asking for €800,000-€1,000,000 from Riot, right? So, this means that Riot alone would be financing H2k entire operation. Are you fucking serious? This has never happened before, in any sport, or industry. It doesn't work like that, I do agree that Riot should and must contribute with X amount of money for each season/year, no doubt. But in my opinion, IT SHOULDN'T be more than 50% of each team operation costs, so in this case, H2k should be ""asking"" for at least 400,000€ to 500,000€ per year, that I can agree with and even then, I think it's too much considering that H2k management doesn't deserve such a thing, considering their job or rather lack of knowledge and work ethic. (Don't take me wrong H2k fans, but it's just my opinion lol, you can take a look at what they have done so far, getting relevant sponsors/partners? 0, social media presence and video content? I mean... I will give them 3 out of 10. And that's just not acceptable, considering they have one of the best EU team and most loved players. And of course, the issue of just having a League Of Legends team, which is absurd and perhaps one of the main reasons they just can't secure decent or average sponsorship deals, It's understandable. Esports is not just League Of Legends, wake the fuck up H2k. Time to put in the work and invest even more if you want to be revelant or even have the ""right"" to ask for millions from Riot LMAO!

Germans produced 127 201 trucks in 1943, Soviets produced 41, 600 and  RKKA received 88 000 foreign trucks.

Considering that both WaA and inventory numbers in for Germans are higher than Soviets for 1942, they were more motorized than Lend-lease fed Red army.


And Im sure another highly relevant comparison is coming. So lets get ahead of it to spare you some time.

Also - There is no sense anymore that we are united as Americans or as Westerners or Europeans (if that is who is reading this). There is an assumption of shame that we all must feel about our arrival at prosperity in which our history and status in the world are constantly called into question. Gone are the days of individuality, and a nuanced view that we have arrived here alongside our brilliant literature, research, art, culture, as well as our failures and evils. We forget that we have consistently course corrected toward a more and more free society and in 2017 it seems we run the risk of falling off the tightrope of that shared identity. By tearing it all down in the name of an overly critical focus on the bad without the good we risk losing it all.

kazuyaminegishi,khazix,,"&gt; I don't think they are, if there are actual conversations going on it is impossible to think H2K not part of them. However one views them they are a legit power house in EU LCS.

This doesn't mean that H2K isn't having conversations it means that the conversations H2K isn't bearing fruit. H2K wants what is essentially a bail out and Riot isn't providing that. Not hard to believe that the other teams just want more advertising options and more ways to reach a wider audience.

&gt; Regardless, H2K is pointing out a real problem of the system that is actually here for quite some while, that Riot is taking the lion's share of LCS's revenue while everyone else is getting very little. It is quite sad as someone who follows multiple esports titles that this is understood as greed.

This isn't something H2K pointed out, this is something that has been pointed out by all of the owners many times. This is why NA is moving to a franchising model. Everyone already knows that most of the revenue LCS was producing up until now was going to Riot directly that's how the LCS continued running. The teams and owners were meant to get their money through the fame of being in a league for the most popular game in the world. That didn't work out so the owners are now trying to move to a different model. This is all fully understood and that has nothing to do with my problem with H2K.

My problem with H2K is how they're going about it. Coming crying to the community like ""big bad Riot won't give us a small loan of 2 mil to get us out of debt can you please put pressure on them or we will leave the EU LCS"" is just underhanded and the fact that no teams are backing them up on it shows that the other owners agree that this is underhanded methodology.",True,0,1506884264,,False,0,dnrmb77,False,t3_73mb19,t1_dnrl6yx,/r/leagueoflegends/comments/73mb19/h2ks_cochairman_speaks_out_on_riot_games_why_his/dnrmb77/,1509211732,6,False,leagueoflegends,t5_2rfxx,
EDI-Thor,,,"I should have resisted my temptation to debate with you. You're starting to lose coherence overall and much of your counterarguments are now non-sensical that I'm not going to address much of them (Chewbacca defense) and now I am wasting my time with your logical fallacies to artificially extend this conversation. There may not exact figures on Koreans preying on SE Asian children (likely due to the secretive nature of the industry rendering more accurate studies difficult), but there are still many Asian sexpats and those multitudes of half-Korean/Japanese children didn't pop out of nowhere 

&gt;I didn't? I said a lot poorer countries than PH like India, Pakistan, almost all African countries, have more dignity in themselves to not whore out females to sexpats.

I'm on mobile but google African sex trafficking. White female sexpats actually go to Africa (as expected you're probably going to make mental gymnastics excuse).

And it also says a lot that you lot are treating women like some property and dictating them whom to date when many of the women voluntarily go date a white person, whether out of love or not. It's also noticeable that you're ignoring the existence of male sex workers. Patriarchal much? Nazis? You sound like the neo-Nazis accusing EU governments of whoring  European women to Muslims. Yeah as other have already pointed, you're all bunch of fascists because of your wet dream to have an Asian supremacists world, dictating women and hating on other races. Sounds like fascistic doesn't it? But you don't care because you're a loon who hates someone of different colour and revelling in that hatred, because if you care about the issue of sex trafficking, why are you and your ilk only concerned with white sexpats and not other Asian sexpats? Why are you letting Asian sexpats a free pass? Ha, ""mistaken priorities"" my ass. If anyone has mistaken priority, it is this sub who are letting the enemy from within a free pass just because they're Asian. 
There are disgusting white predators who come to exploit vulnerable women and children but it's another thing to generalise an entire group.You're using the issue of white sexpats as a cover to be racist to white people in general.

Jaqqarhan,,,"&gt;but declining real wages is unsupportable. 

Your own image shows that real wages peaked in the late 1990s for every quintile except the top one. It also ignores the fact that far more households now have 2 earners compared to the 1970s when stay at home parents were more common. Your choice of household income instead of median wages disguises the fact that there are more workers per household.

&gt;I don't believe that labor can reasonably expect to be paid more for doing less.

They aren't doing less. Workers today are far more skilled than they were in the 1950s-1970s because they have to understand how to work with computers. Automation greatly increased productivity, but the workers also had to learn how to use the new technology.

Do you think CEOs today work 10 times as hard or 10 times as smart as they did 30 years ago? Why are they paid 10 times as much now as they were then? The CEOs aren't the ones who invented all the automation technology that made their companies more productive, so there isn't any reason they should get such a windfall from it. The whole premise that people are paid what they are worth is laughably false. There are lots of very hardworking people in developing countries that make $0.25 per hour. It's not their fault that they are using shitty technology in a country with shitty infrastructure. Similarly, people in the US and Europe were also living on the equivalent of a dollar a day 200 years ago, also not through fault of their own. Wage gains have never been based on how hard people work. When labor productivity increases, people historically get paid more. It's not because they deserve to get paid more, but because it makes the most sense to share the gains. 

&gt;Median personal income has doubled since 1970.

Your source does not support that. It shows a gain from $23k to $31k, which is more like 30% than 100%.

&gt;Disposable income has tripled.

That further proves my point. We had this massive increase in average income (200%) but a tiny increase in median income (30%). That shows that almost all of the productivity gains went to the rich with very little increase for people around the median.

Parabellum8g,NETH,Indifference is the best kind of tolerance /s.,"Calm down. 

I am not arguing against it. What you do see in practice is that marriage is the most difficult piece to put into legislation as it requires a lot of political support. Therefore the best step in between is to actually get a decent civil partnership. Or at least a relatively good civil partnership, and add things along the way. That makes it more pragmatic, as in the end you'll need less political support for such things. Going for the whole deal at once will likely result in no meaningful change *at all*, at least in most countries that still do not have marriage for same sex couples.

Italy is such an example: if only marriage would've been on the table there, same sex couples would've had *nothing* today. Now they at least have nearly full equality before the law. This got massive implications on several fields, including taxation and inheritance. Do not underestimate the importance of it!

I think a violent push towards marriage in countries where there is not enough support for it, might lead to eastern European scenes where everything is put in place to prevent equality for same sex couples.

Philip_Schwartzerdt,religion,Historical Theology | Church History,"This is a question that's impossible to answer with any certainty, because it asks about what did not happen, rather than what did. So there's a good chance this will be removed by this sub's excellent and active mod team. 

But in the meantime, I'll spitball a bit. In my estimation: yes, some kind of Reformation would have happened with or without Luther, but it would likely have gone very differently.

First, Luther was hardly the first figure to propose reforming the Western Church. There were other humanistic reformers at the same time, including Erasmus (with whom Luther had a famous exchange of treatises), and many before too - Jan Hus in Bohemia in the early 15th century, Wycliffe in Britain, and others. Attempts at reform were made in various places going back four centuries before Luther. Like Harry Potter, ""the boy who lived,"" Luther was simply the Reformer who lived.

He had an advantageous political situation in his protection from the Dukes of Saxony and the split attention of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, which helped him continue to write and preach without being burned at the stake first - a fate met by numerous other Reformation predecessors. And he had the fairly recent invention of the printing press, so his message could get out all across Europe, which none of the others had had.

Between those two things, he was perfectly placed to not only spark a Reformation but to survive long-term. One of the greatest wonders of Luther's life is that he died of natural causes at age 63, instead of executed at the behest of the Pope. He was very much influential on the course of the Reformation and I have no doubt it would have gone very differently - he had an immensely powerful personality and rhetoric.

But I also believe something would have happened eventually, even without Luther. As I said, there were so many others before and during Luther's time who wanted to reform the church too, and sooner or later someone else would have taken advantage of political and technological factors like Luther's. The Medieval corruption of the Western Church was a powder keg that was going to explode; Luther happened to be the one to light the match.",True,0,1506885220,,False,0,dnrn8g0,False,t3_73mevs,t3_73mevs,/r/AskHistorians/comments/73mevs/did_martin_luther_make_the_protestant_reformation/dnrn8g0/,1509212222,2,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,

JohnnyJordaan,,,"&gt; The EU deals with the legal aspect, not the moral one.

That simply isn't true. The EU did condemn the Hungarian border control policies, while Hungary was within its right to impose them. They condemned violence against the riots in Egypt and even sanctioned trade to them. They condemned Japan's whaling plan, North-Korean missile launches and police force during Venezuelan protests. It's correct that the EU will more likely condemn situations that are plainly illegal, but that doesn't mean it's a sort of judicial thumbs up or down institute.

&gt; the Spanish police was not the only side resorting to violence today. Police-instigated violence was noticeably more common

Ah come on please. For every riot you can find examples of a rioter attacking a helpless policeman and friendly policemen helping injured rioters or allow bystanders to escape. That's always the case, it's part of riot control. That doesn't change the fact that you can see that every time there was a group of Catalans obstructing passage, the Guardia Civil got their batoons and started hitting them. In plain sight for everyone to see. It also doesn't change the fact that they shot rubber bullets on groups of people that weren't rioting, they were protesting. They shot on people protesting without violence. period.

I think it's really weird to try to put this in perspective like 'yeah but they were also bad sometimes'... Jeez there are elderly people with blood on their face. More than 700 civilians are registered as being treated for medical issues in contrast to a few policemen. There's one video of a policeman getting hit by a chair when he's the first to enter the building.

The USA does, and has, excelled in many fields, but their achievements don't stand out above others when you look at the population disparities.

It would be pretty embarrassing if someone vain-gloriously boasted about British exceptionalism, by comparing them to Belgium, the Czech Republic or Greece. Yet the difference in populations is roughly proportionate to the differences between the USA and the UK or France.

Russia itself didn't return to 1989 peak until 2006

Georgia still hasn't

Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan it was 2005. Kazakhstan 2003. 2006 for Azerbaijan. 

Ukraine has still not returned to 1989 gdp per capita levels. 2004 for Belarus. Moldova is still below 1989 levels. So is Tajikistan. 

I won't finish out the set but most seem to have taken about fifteen years, and some are still struggling today, 25+ years on. 

And that's just returning to peak, not touching on catching up with lost growth.

&gt; Whereas they got nothing as part of the Warsaw pact? The significant amount of funding and investment has helped out all those other third world countries receiving foreign aid? It has nothing to do with embracing good economics?

There is clearly such a thing as good economic policy, but it does not seem to follow with what major Western institutions insist to leaders of third world nations is good economic policy, which instead seems to be economic policy that is good for the West.

The growth of Poland and the Baltic States and other former Soviet states seems to mostly just parallel participation in and access to the European Union and associated funding for industrialization and integration into the giving rather than the reciving end of globalized capitalism.

&gt; Despite calls from Catalan authorities to condemn the brutal police crackdown on their independence referendum, the EU and most member states were reluctant to respond formally, seemingly viewing the dispute as an internal Spanish matter.

&gt; Belgium&amp;#039;s prime minister, Charles Michel, was among the few national leaders to denounce the violence, which the Catalan government said had left 465 people injured as police forcibly removed voters from polling stations and on one occasion fired rubber bullets.

&gt; Video footage showed police hitting people in the crowd with batons while voters peacefully held up their hands, officers dragging women voters from polling stations by their hair, and Spanish police attacking Catalan firefighters.

Rainboq,,,"To really understand why this is going on, you need a brief lesson in Spanish history.

Spain wasn't a unified kingdom in the sense that England or France was. Spain formed through a series of personal unions formed by the Kingdoms of Castille and Aragon. But each area of what eventually became Spain had their own regional power called a Junta, which was a sort of elected assembly. Add in Christopher Columbus and you get the Spanish Empire, which chugged along more or less intact until a Frenchman named Napoleon decided to light Europe on fire. 

During the Napoleonic wars, the little corporal deposed the Spanish Monarchy, and tried to install a puppet. It didn't work and the Spaniards turned to the Juntas for leadership, who with British support started what's known to history as the Spanish Ulcer. 

That the Juntas managed to get a say, and thus some sort of democratic government in place during this period permanently weakened the Spanish crown and lead to some pretty shakey government in Spain until the First Spanish Republic in 1873, which was pretty quickly overthrown and lead to the restoration of the Spanish Burbons a year later. The Spanish Burbons managed to bumble along until 1931, where they were overthrown and the second Spanish republic was founded. Only to be overthrown by the Francoists in 1939 in the Spanish civil war that preceded World War 2. So then you get facism under Franco until he dies in 1973, which leaves Juan Carlos as the King of Spain, who transitioned the country to a constitutional Monarchy in 1975 (he EDIT: ABDICATED, not died in 2014), and thus far they've continued chugging along as one.

And during that whole time, from the Reconquista by the thrones of Castille and Aragon, to now, Catalan has wanted to be independent. They have a different language, a different culture and they resent the control of Madrid. In recent times, since the EU economic crisis, they've increasingly come to view the government in Madrid as incompetent and dangerous to them, and so they want out more than ever from under the Spanish.

Chaingunfighter,0279,,"I think you're just meme trolling, but in case you aren't.

&gt;Japanese smiths spend years working on a single katana

This is only true of a very small number of katanas. The vast majority were mass manufactured just like swords of practically any other culture. Any sword made to superb quality would only go to someone with significant wealth or status, which was (and still is) true pretty much everywhere in the world.

I mean, just think about it. How would anyone equip armies of thousands of soldiers if it took that long?

&gt;fold it up to a million times

The steel itself is only folded about 8-16 times, but this creates around a million individual *layers* of steel, which is quite a bit different than folding it a million times. Also, the reason this was done was because most of the iron in Japan was very poor quality, and folding in the smithing process helped increase the durability and strength of the alloy.

&gt;Katanas are thrice as sharp as European swords

Sharpness isn't all there is in a sword, nor even to the edge. A sword with a comparatively blunted portion but a geometrically sound edge might actually cut better than another sword with a sharper edge but disproportionate geometry. 

And they weren't often significantly sharper anyway.

&gt;thrice as hard for that matter too.

That's actually not true. Their smithing processes heavily increased the durability of their own steel, but again, this was because their steel was generally inferior. The process wasn't as common in Europe because it simply wasn't necessary. The steel was already more than sufficient, and you'll find that quality European swords were actually generally better than Japanese equivalents, though this varies.

&gt;I'm pretty sure a katana could easily bisect a knight wearing full plate with a simple vertical slash.

No sword is going to cut through plate armor when swung with normal human strength, let alone ""bisect"" them. It's already incredible difficult to slice through a totally unarmored person.

&gt;Ever wonder why medieval Europe never bothered conquering Japan?

Medieval European states weren't really conquering anything outside of Europe. They had a difficult enough time fighting against enemies in the Middle East and Africa - no European army was ever even remotely close to Japan in the medieval period.

&gt;That's right, they were too scared to fight the disciplined Samurai and their katanas of destruction.

Most of them probably didn't even *know* about Japan, certainly not most soldiers. But either way, in a hypothetical battle between armies, katanas wouldn't be likely to see much use. Neither European nor Japanese armies tended to base their forces around sword use, but instead preferred spears/polearms in melee combat. Swords were usually only sidearms. 

&gt;Even in World War II, American soldiers targeted the men with the katanas first because their killing power was feared and respected.

In the rare case that Japanese soldiers decided to charge Americans with their swords/bayonets, yes, they were shot first, because they're closer and actively closing distance. This was incredibly rare, though, and charges almost always resulted in their men getting cut down by rifle and machine gun fire. Most Japanese soldiers preferred their guns anyway.

&gt;Katanas are simply the best sword that the world has ever seen. This is a fact and you can't deny it.

That's a false statement even at its base. There is no blanket ""best sword in history"" because swords have been used for a variety of different purposes throughout history. A katana would be a terrible weapon in a pitched battle against say a Roman Legion, because you're left vulnerable to their javelins and are also far more open and exposed up against them with their shields.",True,0,1506886929,,False,0,dnrowrt,False,t3_73n4sx,t1_dnrmqk2,/r/whowouldwin/comments/73n4sx/gladiatorial_combat_will_be_added_to_the_2020/dnrowrt/,1509213120,233,False,whowouldwin,t5_2s599,

Further, people travelling in that route have way lower income than them travelling on Mumbai -Ahmedabad route (this is just my guess due to UP, Jharkhand in between, Gujjus are rich). 

I also skimmed over the study you were referring to ([This one, right?](https://web.iima.ac.in/assets/snippets/workingpaperpdf/10701585992016-03-58.pdf)) and it too concluded that-

In terms of future network growth, this segment can be part of further extension to Jaipur and Delhi. 


While I agree that there can be political reasons too (of course the current PM is from Gujrat), but altogether, this is probably the best route under 600 km.


Edit- From a Wiki page on [HSR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail)

&gt;High-speed rail (HSR) is best suited for journeys of 1 to 4½ hours (about 150–900 km or 93–559 mi), for which the train can beat air and car trip time. For trips under about 700 km (430 mi), the process of checking in and going through airport security, as well as traveling to and from the airport, makes the total air journey time equal to or slower than HSR. European authorities treat HSR as competitive with passenger air for HSR trips under 4½ hours.

immoralatheist,,,"Americans in general generally are not big fans of using coins. People kind of see any change in coins as borderline useless. Essentially, if your total is $19.00 and you pay with a $20, people are glad to take the $1 and will spend it, but if it's $19.01 people will take the $0.99 home and throw it in a jar or on the counter to be lost. Nobody here is really expecting to actually use them ever. It's a bit of a strange situation, but if we stopped printing the dollar bill and started using just dollar coins (which we totally should), then maybe that would change. 

Also if we put the price inclusive of tax on price tags. If I go into a shop in the UK and see €0.69 and I have exact change then I'll use it. In the US, I'm just going to hand them a dollar bill, even if I have $4 worth of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters in my pocket. 


I don't mind them when I'm somewhere where I'm paying cash for things day to day (ie. when I'm in Europe) and I just add a bit of change to my everyday pocket items phone/wallet/keys/pocket knife/ear buds, but it in the US, that pile of change isn't in it because I'm more likely to use a card here than I am elsewhere, so any change I get on the rare occasion I use cash is just a pain.

Avis_Aurantia,zhin rank15mastery,I'm not sorry.,"1 I am coming from Gold IV, nothing special about it.I am not a master or anything higher than that. I heard that in higher ranks Zhin start to lose his effectiveness. I can't clarify that since I am just a ""goldie"".

2 It's because according to some people Zhin has a low skill-ceiling. Then another group of  people are saying that he has high skill-ceiling, actually. To be honest I choose the middle golden road between them. Maybe because players still has to manage Zhin's cooldowns even with low cd abilities. It's very easy to waste counter, billow then whirl and still have no safe cover for him. Also it's easy to miss his ult too, I remember when started with him and literally missed every ult.

3 Maybe your teammates don't understand what do you say to them. Do you play on European servers? I am hungarian, I can talk english luckly but  there are always a lot of russians here who can only speak/type in russian. Most of the time we lose because we don't understand each other.

For the last thing, I am bit confused about what you say... so you say that your team can deal with him, but later your team cannot because him and his team attack you? They grouped up and striked back which is a thing in this game. Sadly, my team doesn't do it often, I always beg them to group up and not doing ""conga lines"" to the point.

&gt; A flank shouldn't be allowed to do this

What shouldn't he do exactly?
&gt;There is no counter for Zhin.

He is still direct damage so haven counters him. Whirl is AoE and most Zhin players like me use it as a finisher blow. But still Haven helps more here.
According to Paladinscounter votes, Zhin is weak against Ash and Torvald mainly. I can clarify the Torvald one. Most of the time, i have a hard time dealing with Torvald and since he got a long range shooting it's even harder.

To be honest, retaliation zhin should stay, it offers a good diversity between a smolder/Guillotine Zhin and generally between any Champs. It's kinda boring that there are legendary cards which only gives damage more heals etc. 
If he choose retaliation he give up two other ways to fight. That's why the card system and that makes Paladins very interesting for me. 
Healing cards should also stay with him. It's available for everyone as i know why he should not get healing from cards at all? That sounds very unfair especially for a flanker who is often far away from his/her support teammates. Also cauterize/dead zone is a thing, you can't use it against Smolder Zhin but against Retaliation Zhin  if somebody shoot his back.",True,0,1506887601,,False,0,dnrpkgr,True,t3_73fdqu,t1_dnr700p,/r/Paladins/comments/73fdqu/master_of_the_thousand_chibis/dnrpkgr/,1509213466,1,False,Paladins,t5_2v7zr,

&gt; 
&gt; At a fringe event at Tory conference, Fox said that he’s been keeping very busy, thank you very much, and that he spent most of his time ‘looking at opportunities’ for British exporters. **And for those who thought Fox is actually just twiddling his thumbs, he had a message: you ‘clearly do not understand much about trade because trade agreements are only part of what happens’**.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr S. is sure that all of that must be keeping Fox busy. But he was also surprised to hear Fox’s answer to whether he had found the time to read the Tories’ post-mortem report on what went wrong for the party at the doomed snap election: I haven’t read it, said Fox. Oh dear…

KanchiEtGyadun,,,"&gt; If it was just recognition why wouldnt they just accepted it ?

It would seriously jeopardise the Turkish creation myth that Ataturk heroically repulsed European colonial powers and created Turkey via immaculate conception. In reality, Turkey committed genocide to all of its Christian minorities and fought off the rest that managed to survive. Ataturk wasn't complicit in the genocide, but certainly owed his military successes to its legacy. So for the secularists in Turkey, recognising the genocide is a big no-no as it's just not compatible with the CHP's narrative.

For the rest of the country, recognising the genocide would put a massive stain on Ottoman history, and would generally be an gargantuan source of national shame, one that I don't think Turkey is ready to handle yet. 

For all these reasons, Turkey won't accept recognition, and will keep pushing the myth that Armenia wants to take land from Turkey as the scapegoat. While it's true that most diasporan Armenians support this position, the Republic of Armenia has never had any territorial designs on Turkey, and there's no real chance that it ever will. 

EDIT: In response to your reply:

What do you want to me say? It's just my thoughts on why Turkey has yet to recognise it.

He's one-footed and predictable, but he's never been inconsistent.  If you want someone who reminds you of Nani look at Mkhitaryan.  Completely anonymous one game.  Scores two goals the next.  He was very poor mid-week there in Europe, IMO, kept losing the ball and was largely ineffective.

Rubus phoenicolasius (Japanese Wineberry, wine raspberry, wineberry or dewberry) is an Asian species of raspberry (Rubus subgenus Idaeobatus) in the rose family.

It is native to China, Japan, and Korea.

The species was introduced to Europe and North America as an ornamental plant and for its potential in breeding hybrid raspberries. It has subsequently escaped from cultivation and become naturalised and sometimes invasive in parts of Europe and North America.

If I was really worried I would appeal to the EU and ask them to supervise a lawful vote on it.

The reason they are not trying to legitimate their act is

1) they know that they would lose in a legitimate vote

2) they have awful procedures by design letting people vote multiple times

3) they get more sympathy by doing things unlawfully and then complain at the crackdown than by engaging in regular referendums.

Gerade in Spanien haben sich rechtspopulistische oder rechtsextreme Parteien nicht durchgesetzt im Vergleich zu anderen Ländern in Europa.

&gt;Europa ist nach rechts gerückt, zumindest lässt die Europawahl 2014 diesen Schluss zu. Doch es gibt auch Mitgliedstaaten, in denen es weder Rechtspopulisten noch Rechtsextremen wirklich gelingt, Fuß zu fassen.
Warum die Europawahlen zum Beispiel in Spanien und Portugal anders gelaufen sind:

&gt;Doch gerade in Ländern wie Spanien, Portugal, Irland und Zypern – alles Länder, die Hilfen des EU-Rettungsschirm in Anspruch nehmen mussten – konnten Rechtsaußenparteien bei der jüngsten Europawahl nicht punkten, geschweige denn Parlamentsmandate erringen.

Gerade in Spanien hat fast die Hälfte der jungen Generation keine Perspektive auf einen Job. Das gilt auch für gut ausgebildete Kräfte.

&gt;Democracy features referendum as direct way of people to express their views. Look at brexit. Should whole european union vote if they want it to happen? It would never be so.

Yes, you're right. Referendum is an important part of democratic systems. The referendum in The UK was legal, because the whole coutry voted in it. Wheather it was a good idea to have a referendum or not is a different story (it wasn't, and the pro-brexit side knows it, which is why nothing has really happened after the vote). 

&gt; If a region of spain wants to be independent, its democracy.

It's not. It would be, if the whole country took part in the vote. But then the result would be of course easy to predict.

They trace their pre-Christian Jewish heritage to their Queen Sheba from Israel's King Solomon, even having centuries-old parascriptual texts detailing their history (e.g. the Kebra Negast). Cool stuff, and would be awesome to see some MegaTen spin on it.

I guess I'll write my thoughts about it for future reference. I'll help myself with ArsTechnica's review of it: https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/eu-study-finds-piracy-doesnt-hurt-game-sales-may-actually-help/

*In italics my own comments.* [relevant page of the report between brackets]

----

The report detected ""pirates"" usually consume more games. [p.15] [p.84]

&gt;For games, the estimated effect of illegal online transactions on sales is positive – implying that illegal consumption leads to increased legal consumption. This positive effect of illegal downloads and streams on the sales of games **may be explained by the industry being successful in converting illegal users to paying users.** Tactics used by the industry include, for example, **offering gameplay with extra bonuses or extra levels if consumers pay.**

*But then how about* ***full*** *games without* ***patches/DLC/online multiplayer*** *that don't offer such a scheme to entice pirates to get the legit version?*

Also ArsTechnica seems to mention that they correlate knowing about piracy terms with being a pirate. So anyone with some know-how might be categorised as pirate (because they can't just ask people if they pirate games and be assured to get a straight answer). [p.110 and around]

They also noted that their error margins were very big, so some of their results aren't really representative (*which is why some people worded it to ""they couldn't prove that piracy affected sales""*).

It also noted that pirated games would replace free/cheap games for that pirate. [p.137] The author says that since those are free games, no real ""sales"" are lost, but some advertising revenue might be. *So does that mean that those free/cheap games would still suffer from piracy of other games, by having them as competition?*

Not mentionned in the ArsTechnica review is that they noted that piracy had a noticeable negative impact for Movies [p.148],
 and notably people were unwilling to pay to see a movie a second time if they already saw it pirated once. [p.158] Which is logical for something you consume by looking. *So how about story-based games that also work that way?*

For music, it's still undetermined due to the concept of ""sampling"" [p.83]

&gt;The academic debate whether file sharing reduces or increases legal demand for music is not settled. 

Also important, "" the price does not help explain the piracy of music, e-books and games. "" [p.170]

They also mention that the Games market is growing, but that physical game sales are plummetting. Movies and book sales are declining in total even by taking in account online. [p.79]

(Nothing about indies in particular. *Caveat for them usually making smaller games?*)

----
 
Food for thought, not every game is impacted the same way. The report seems to indicate two ways a game could be impacted negatively by piracy, either because it doesn't have any mechanism to entice pirates to buy it (multiplayer, microtransactions, DLC) or because pirated games compete with it (free/cheaper games get replaced by pirated games). 

Adding to that, their statement about people unwilling to pay to see a movie they already saw might be interesting in the debate for story-based games and gameplay streaming.",True,0,1506893434,,1506929763,0,dnruy5n,False,t3_73n5ag,t1_dnrr07l,/r/Games/comments/73n5ag/why_does_this_sub_and_reddit_in_general_give_such/dnruy5n/,1509216311,2,False,Games,t5_2qhwp,

First of all historical maces were around 2 pounds not 8, 8 pound mace would be extremely cumbersome.

By forcing your enemy to use mass weapon, instead of thrusting or cutting weapon you already gained an advantage - mass weapons are generally shorter, slower, worse at both attacking and defending and injuries from them are less dangerous than cuts or thrusts.

For the previous reasons mass weapons scale well with being more armored, as you can more easily afford lesser reach, need to defend less with your weapon and can afford making more attacks before killing enemy.

Mass weapons scale particularly well by being two handed, as compared to one handed. Conveniently the more armor you are wearing the less need is there for shield, as you are less vulnerable, making two handed weapon much safer choice if you are in plate armor.

Plate armor also greatly reduces damage from mass weapons, and forces you into heavy swings to damage your opponent, which are easier to defend against and harder to recover from if they fail. One handed mass weapons are not particularly effective against opponent in plate armor that actively defends himself, and even with something poleaxe its not easy to deliver blow which defeats someone in plate armor who does not want to be hit.

Nothing is as it seems.

There really are secret organizations controlling the world from the shadows.

Your paranoia is warranted.

In the Horror Shop 'verse, there are dozens of conspiracies and secret societies competing with each other for control over the world in what is known as the Secret War. Though occasionally this war does go hot and breaks out into actual conflict, usually the war is fought with spies and agents, through blackmail and bribery. They seek out the truth, while denying their rivals access to knowledge. They spread lies and misinformation to keep the public in the dark. They control governments, corporations, non-profits, and churches through infiltration, intimidation, and the occult. And if they should win, they will have a chance to shape the next age of humanity.

Among these secret societies are:

* **The Antiquarians:** The unliving heirs of Ancient Egypt who control access to the relics and knowledge of that great empire. 

* **The Architects:** Heirs to those who built Atlantis, and who have orchestrated the return of humanity to the lofty heights of the mythic age. They see themselves as the key to the next step in humanity's evolution, as handed down to them by mysterious benefactors back in Ancient Sumeria.

* **The Bilderberg Group:** The masters of capitalism who seek to spread their economic dominance across the world.

* **Blackwatch:** A supernatural PMC often hired by governments and corporations to protect sites of paranormal importance, or to handle occult threats.

* **The Byfrost Group of Companies:** A sprawling, international conglomeration with their hands in countless industries, and a peculiar interest in the occult. 

* **The City of Jewels:** The capital of the ifrit, and the most influential economic power in the supernatural world, whose bazaars brim with wonders and goods from all corners of the multiverse.

* **The Court of Wolves:** The sons of Romulus and Remus, who view themselves as the rightful leaders of the world's werewolves. 

* **The Freemasons:** A much-diminished order that still holds some secrets close to their chest.

* **The Green Dragon:** Disciples of the dragons of Tibet, and the original shinobi, who believe that chaos and anarchy will eventually give rise to true order.

* **The Hashshashin:** Servants of Death who believe that through careful, targeted killing they can change the variables and establish paradise on Earth

* **Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn:** Victorian occultists who follow the teachings of Alister Crowley and his disciples and seek enlightenment through all sorts of questionable acts. 

* **The Holy Inquisition:** Operating under the directive of the Pope himself, the Holy Inquisition seeks to stamp out the occult and the supernatural wherever it exists--all to save the soul of humanity.

* **The Illuminati:** The All-Seeing Eye, who shape society through blackmail, bribery, and controlling the flow of information across the world. 

* **The Invisible College:** Scientists, scholars, and magicians who will accept no limitations on the scientific process, and continually push and prod at the boundaries of knowledge.

* **The Knights of the Golden Circle:** the sons of the Confederate States who use their considerable wealth and connections, as well as occult means, to attempt to establish white dominance over the Americas.

* **The Knights Templar:** Guardians of the treasures of Jerusalem, the Templars are willing to go to extreme lengths to save humanity from the things that go bump in the night.

* **Mount Order Society:** An ancient society of writers and thinkers interested in developing civilization, and uses occult means to ensure humanity's progress.

* **The Network:** A decentralized group of hackers and programmers who engage in hidden acts of cyberterrorism to slowly gather power in this new, digital world. 

* **The Orders of Atlantis:** Founded at the Tower of Babel, the Orders are an ancient brotherhood of mages who are dedicated to preserving the knowledge of magic and the Mythic age.

**The Order of the Nine Angles:** Originally one of the Atlantean Orders, the Nine Angels were cast out for consorting with demons and other fel entities. The Nine Angels believe nothing should stand in the way of a mage's power--not even damnation.

* **The Parliament of Shadows:** The government of the monsters that lurk in the shadows and the things that go bump in the know, who have their claws woven throughout society--and who know exactly what you're terrified of.

* **The Reptilians:** Shapeshifting aliens from another planet who have infiltrated countless organizations, governments, and even secret societies--all for some unknown, but certainly sinister, reason.

* **The Sons of the Dragon:** The followers of Dracula, and the most powerful vampire coven in the modern world, who use sophistication and politics to gather power and influence the ""cattle.""

* **The Summer Court:** The fey of heroism and courage, loyal to Queen Titania and King Oberon, who seek to bring light and justice back to the world--regardless of the consequences.

* **The Thirty-first House:** Outcast horrors who reject the political games of the Parliament and embrace a horrors monstrous potential. 

* **The Thule Society:** The last survivors of the Third Reich, who fled to the dark side of the Moon. Use occult science in their attempts to create a race of Aryan Ubermensch who will lead the Thule in taking back Europe and establishing a Fourth Reich.

* **The Veil Treaty:** The supernatural United Nations, where the various factions gather and air their grievances. The Treat's agents--the Men in Black--work to keep the supernatural world hidden and separate from the mundane world.

* **The Winter Court:** The fey of villainy, who wish to retake control of Faerie and swathe the Verdant Realm in eternal winter once again.

And this represents maybe a quarter of the organizations active the in the world today--I'm not even going to try and talk about the **Cathars**, the **Committee of 300**, the **Merovingian Dynasty**, the **Priory of Scion**, the **Rosicrucians**, the **Skull and Bones Society**, the **Vril Society**, **Majestic-12**, **MI-18**, **Department 7**, the **Red Library**, the **Patriotic Spirits Society,** the **Cult of the Black Pharaoh**, **Cicada 3301**, the **City of Brass**, the **Kingdom Under the Mountain**, the **Council on Foreign Relations**, the **Trilateral Commission**, **Beati Paoli**, the **White Lotus**, the **Magnus Society**, the **Children of Cain**, the **Zodiac Club,** **Opus Dei** and countless others...

Suffice to say that if you suspect someone is pulling the strings, the answer is probably ""yes, and somebody is pulling their strings as well."" The trick is finding out where the strings end--who are the real puppet masters of the world.

bizcochocho,,,"So here is a sort of **FAQ** I hope might help to inform opinions. Again, I'm trying to remain neutral explaining every position. You can agree or not, but that's how things are ;)

**Why does Catalonia want independence?**
Spain is organized in autonomous communities, and Catalonia is one of them. Through their long history they have been part of different entities. It wasn't until the 12th century that they began being a part of the kingdom of Aragon, and then in the 15th century the 2 main kingdoms were united (Castille and Aragon), forming the base of what is known today as Spain. They have always enjoyed some autonomy and have also developed a distinct culture and their own language. Their claim for autonomy has strengthened in the last years. They are a wealthy region, payers of around 20% of tax income in Spain. However, bear in mind that not all Catalans are for independence. Polls show 70% of Catalans want to be able to vote in a referendum but they are more evenly divided when it comes to independence. A survey showed 49.4% of Catalans were against independence and 41.1% were in favour. Today,  Carles Puigdemont, argues that Catalonia has a moral, cultural, economic and political right to self-determination.

[Why do some Catalans want independence and what is Spain's view?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/21/why-do-some-catalans-want-independence-and-what-is-spains-view)

**What's the government's position?**
There was already a referendum and since then the tension has only escalated. The issue is a constant in Spanish news. Catalonia is a fundamental part of Spain, in a historical and economic sense. Spain relies heavily in Catalonia's revenue. Moreover, Spain is a diverse country, full of cultures and diversity. The governments wants to respect these differences in a united Spain. The referendum was deemed illegal by the Constitutional Court some time ago. It argues that any referendum on Catalan independence would be illegal because Spain’s 1978 constitution makes no provision for a vote on self-determination. Spain’s democratic constitution of 1978, which was approved by more than 90% of Catalan voters, gave wide autonomy to the regions but affirmed “the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation”. Only the Spanish parliament can change the constitution. Mr Puigdemont’s referendum is therefore illegal. Moreover, the Spanish executive claims that the Catalan transition law is “more appropriate of an autocratic regime”, and did not follow the appropriate way to properly celebrate a referendum. What would happen if the police didn't show up to close the polling places? If the government allowed the people to vote, not only would they be disregarding the illegality of the voting that they themselves have declared, but they'd be opening a way to other nationalist and independent claims to make their case (Basque Country and Galicia).

**What's the international position?**
Europe is a continent full of claims for independence. Take Corsica in France, or Flanders in Belgium, and the list goes on an on. Supporting the nationalists would mean recognizing these movements and would be a very dangerous move. Catalonia is planning on joining the EU if it leaves. However, it's the same argument all over again. Accepting and recognizing Catalonia as an independent country would leave sovereign states weak against their independence claims. It is a very risky move.
Big companies are already displacing their businesses to Madrid, fearing the downturn of the region's economy. Spain would also be hurt, seeing the second most economically relevant region leave. This is very concerning for investors and for the international community.
And some other actors as the US also support Spain's unity, for all of the above reasons. In a meeting with Spanish President Mariano Rajoy, Donald Trump said: “I really think the people of Catalonia would stay with Spain. I think it would be foolish not to.""

**How did we get here?**
Tensions have escalated significantly this week after Spanish Guardia Civil officers raided a dozen regional government premises in Barcelona and arrested 14 senior officials, including Catalonia’s secretary general of economic affairs and the secretary of taxation. Police have seized nearly 10m ballot papers and confiscated more than 1.5m referendum leaflets and posters. Meanwhile, the interior ministry cancelled all leave for the Guardia Civil and national police officers tasked with preventing the referendum, the Spanish government has imposed controls on regional spending.
Today, Spanish police have clashed with voters as thousands of people flocked to the polls to vote in the Catalonia independence referendum.

Dopecheez-,,Georgist,"&gt;Many of those Tribal claims are better understood in terms of the way nation-states claim to own vaste swathes of land than in terms of the private ownership we're discussing.

I don't really see your point. Just because the Native Americans didn't have the same concept of private land ownership does not mean that we had the right to claim ownership for ourselves, and especially not in the violent and genocidal manner that we as European immigrants did. Even if in some cases a consensual agreement was made, I am referring to the many cases in which that did not happen, and the land was simply taken by force. According to the NAP, all land obtained in such a way is illegitimate and as such we have no claim to ownership of it.

&gt;Anyhow, sure, if someone completely abandons an appartment for years on end and makes no attempt to defend it, then it's up for grabs.

Yeah, that's bullshit. There is no way I would be allowed to claim ownership of someone's house or land just because they hadn't used it for a few years. I would be violently removed from the property. Also, nothing in the NAP says that property rights become invalid if the property sits idle for a few years, so I'm not even sure what reasonable basis a libertarian would have for doing so. But it just illustrates how arbitrary property rights are, and the fact that people can't agree on them ensures that a government is necessary to enforce one particular interpretation.

Why not? You're comparing an airport that isn't even in the city it's named for (and actually looks to have three towns in between) to ones that are directly inside of a dense city. There is no way you can tell me with a straight face that those are comparable.

&gt;Besides, not every airport in New York is a major hub

xb70valkyrie,south-african-union,Union of South Africa: the real USA,"&gt; Black people rightfully and valiantly fought to gain their freedom.

Incorrect in either case.

In Rhodesia, there was an internal settlement between the white government and black activists who had denounced violence. Said settlement resulted in the 1979 elections, which were won by Abel Muzorewa; Muzorewa was unable to defeat the black nationalist groups, and ended up conceding the country's sovereignity to the UK. Cue the Lancaster House agreements and Zimbabwe's independence in 1980.

In South Africa, the international sanctions declared after State President PW Botha's infamous 1985 Rubicon speech aggravated the country's economic stagnation. Opposition to apartheid became stronger, together with opposition to the Border War; as the latter conflict came to a close, the fear of a communist takeover of South Africa dissipated, meaning that apartheid and the ban on black nationalist and communist groups was no longer justifiable. When FW de Klerk was elected in 1989, he set out to dramatically reform the system, leading to the immediate release of all political prisoners and the legalisation of the ANC. CODESA, a forum for the discussion of possibilities for a multiracial democracy in South Africa, was held from 1991 to 1993; from there, the multiracial elections of 1994 drew its base.

&gt; it was never Black people acting aggressively towards White people. Consistently, throughout history, it has been white people acting as the aggressors towards Black civilizations.

While European colonialism is (rightfully) remembered for its brutality and abuse, you're whitewashing the other side, ignoring how the Zulu conquest of Southeastern Africa frequently involved massacres of both indigenous and white people (the most famous of which being arguably the prelude to the Battle of Blood River).

cruyff8,kensington-and-chelsea,,"&gt;  Islamic doctrines and violence we see in the Muslim world

The first Islamic doctrine I'd do away with is the bizarre notion that translations of scripture are not valid and shouldn't be read. While I can read and understand colloquial Arabic, reading Islamic scripture is more akin to reading Beowulf than reading the Sun in that I need a guide to it. 

And various relatives pointing me to ""great scholars that all the kids are listening to"" isn't the way to do this. 

I'm no longer a Muslim for various reasons, none having to do with scripture, rather the us vs them mentality presented by a given imam in the mosque near where I grew up. 

I firmly believe you can find justification for the [Edhi ambulance service](https://www.edhi.org.au/ambulance-services/) as well as 7/7 in the same scripture. This is because, like one may think that the Mona Lisa is da Vinci and the chap sitting next to you may not, one can interpret the scripture any way one wants to.

The referendum was non-binding, so it's only advisory. Most of the MPs, and experts, think it is a bad idea. Also the margin of victory/defeat was very small. And now we have potential Brexit ""plans"" on the table why don't we vote on those... At least the Lib Dems had a decent idea with having a second referendum.

whangadude,,,"This was an attempt to try and create a kinda realistic world where alot of history has changed, and therefore things that normally happen in alternate history do not. Whilst keeping some of the usual things there (independent Texas, how original).

The main begining of change was Portuguese missionaries successfully converting a few members of the upper class Korean hierarchy to Catholicism at just the right point in history that they overthrow the Monarchy and start semi-meritocratic Catholic Republic, and being Christian they get better deals with trade with Europe and Westernise become a colonial empire (oh wow, like Japan, but not) and when Industrialisation happens in the West, Korea starts it at the same time allowing them to keep up and compete as equals.
This is the starting point of the butterflies that change history.

Other points is that America is the name given to South America IOTL but Colombia is the name given to North America, coz that stops confusingment, and will end up getting people even more angry once everyone realize how much of a dick Columbus was.
Plenty of things happened the same, scramble for Africa went along the same.
France and Scandinavia have had a good alliance for along time, which is why France gave them a few colonial possesions around the world, like North Madagascar and South South New Zealand.

The Four King Alliance is a kind of a union between the Kingdoms of Sicily, Yugoslavia, Hungary and Romania, where they are completely independent on all matters internal but dealing with outside nations they are a single united front, this was a result of them seeing how the Germans and French worked different factions of Italy against each other and how Germany treated the Poles and Ukrainians. It is a fragile alliance but one that each Kingdom knows is a necessity. But decades of having a united military has created a strong socialist/communist anti-monarchist underground of men no longer seeing the differences between their Kings, unfortunately for them, the Germans and Ottomans are aware of these factions and secretly help fund and ferment these groups.

Russia never really got their act together, with a string of Tsars dying young with no heirs and lots of illegitimate claimants to the thrones leading to civil wars every few decades for a century or so, this allowed the Poles (later on Germans) Swedes (later on Scandinavians) and Ottomans to slowly cut away from what we would see as her usual territory.

The Ottomans reformed earlier and more stabler than IOTL, launching a series of campaigns to bring the Egyptians back under control and to establish control over their fellow Muslims in the steppes, and having moderate control over the Emirates of Afghanistan and the Shinjang Khanate, who both accept the Ottoman Ruler as the legitimate Kalif of all Islam.

The wonky borders of the former United States of Colombia (USA) are the results of this timelines Civil War petering out with no conclusive victory to either sides, a series of secondary minor wars, and eventually allowing each county to vote on which side to end up under.

The lots of little nations along the Himalayas is because too often I see maps where people just give those little kingdoms to either India or Tibet/China, whereas historically they were generally alot of them, and it was only because (in my opinion) that Great Britain won out at become the only European to have real control of the subcontinent, so I think it would make sense that in a world where no one single European power won out in India that those little Kingdoms would survive into the modern era.

Hope ya'll enjoy it. I submitted this last year but forgot to put an explanation and I think many people assumed this was some bullshit WWI went really bazar and how the hell did all this happen with just a couple decades to change.

how can you be american and say that? we're literally a huge mixing pot of cultures that then assimilated. go back a hundred years ago and it was stated that even different european cultures couldn't assimilate. being european as an identity wasn't really a thing. but all of that proved wrong.

ultimately we're all human, and more similar than we are different. fear-inundated retards like you focus on the differences, misperceiving them to be far larger than they really are. and you only do that because you haven't been exposed to enough of those cultures to realize how we are more similar than different.

&gt;**Presidente catalão diz que Catalunha 'ganhou direito de ser um Estado'; primeiro-ministro espanhol Mariano Rajoy afirma que não houve referendo.**  


&gt; Puigdemont prometeu levar o resultado da votação ao Parlamento para que se atue de acordo com a lei do referendo, que prevê a proclamação unilateral de independência. Ele afirmou ainda que a União Europeia não pode ""continuar olhando para outro lado"" em relação à violação de direitos humanos constatada neste domingo com as agressões sofridas pelos catalães pela polícia espanhola. Poucas horas antes, porém, o primeiro-ministro da Espanha, Mariano Rajoy, afirmou que “não houve um referendo de autodeterminação na Catalunha hoje”. Um forte esquema de repressão policial foi usado para tentar impedir a votação neste domingo e 844 pessoas ficaram feridas, segundo a Secretaria de Saúde do governo regional catalão. Eleitores favoráveis ao referendo ocupavam colégios eleitorais havia dias para garantir a realização do referendo, enquanto a polícia espanhola realizava operações para apreender cédulas e material de votação e fechar locais que seriam usados neste domingo. Centenas de milhares de catalães foram às ruas nas últimas semanas para protestar contra a campanha de Madri para suprimir a votação. O Estado de Direito funciona"", afirmou o primeiro-ministro do país, o conservador Mariano Rajoy, ao ser questionado sobre as operações.

FarawayFairways,,,"&gt; They voted no, but if they had voted yes they still could have joined the EU.

Maybe eventually, there are a few critical things that you have to have in place first, and which Scotland doesn't. 

To become a new member you have to join the Euro. In order to join the Euro area though you have to meet certain criteria

Scotland would need to brutalise their public services to start with.  Government deficit cannot be higher than 3% of GDP (Scotland's is 9%). Government debt cannot be higher than 60% of GDP (I don't know what Catalunya's is, but it must be high). The inflation rate cannot be higher than 1.5 percentage points above the rate of the 3 best-performing member states.

You also need your own independent central bank which I don't think Catalunya has? Bank of Spain?

There's also another less known issue concerning the redistribution of finance flows under the somewhat shadowy mechanism called Target 2 to consider. Independence potentially allows Catalunya to renege on this as they fall out of the Euro zone and are no longer covered. The probability therefore is that Germany is on the hook and they aren't going to pick up the Catalan defaulted debt (you'll need someone more expert than me to explain Target 2 admittedly) but I'm given to understand that it become a quite formidable barrier that few people are aware of",True,0,1506900276,,False,0,dns0o2f,False,t3_73o7an,t1_dnry8ac,/r/worldnews/comments/73o7an/catalonia_has_won_right_to_statehood/dns0o2f/,1509219289,3,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,

This is different from the Scotland case: the UK has no written constitution, and the UK government approved of the referendum. They were willing to grant Scotland its independence in the event that the referendum would pass, and since the territory belongs to the UK, the UK is of course able to ""free"" it.

It's also different from the Brexit case: the EU has a codified way for a member state to leave on request and regain full sovereignty. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty (the renamed EU constitution) says: ""Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements"". The UK government just told the EU they were leaving and that was that.

It is more similar to the case of the US civil war. The southern states said they were leaving (#sexit?), but there was no constitutional provision for them to be able to just leave, and the federal government did not allow them to. The southern states took control of federal army bases, the federal army came in, and it was war.

In Spain it's similar: Catalonia wants to leave, but there is no constitutional provision for them to be able to leave unilaterally, and the Spanish government does not want them to leave.

rubemll,,,"Só pode vender se tiver selo do inmetro. Mas o selo não garante grandes coisas, digo, os testes pra conseguir o selo são simples.

Uso remold, pego estrada de chão, não tenho dó de acertar buraco, e não tenho problemas. MAS... a durabilidade em asfalto é menor, porque no processo de remoldagem GERALMENTE (Tem mil empresas, algumas são diferentes, vou pela média) se usa borracha mais em conta, com temperatura de moldagem menor. Essa borracha mais mole pode ter aderência diferente em chuva e tal, mas GERALMENTE gasta mais rápido, se diz que a média é durar 15 mil km de asfalto.

15 mil km nalguns usos pode parecer muito, mas essa média geralmente é 25 mil km com pneus ""normais"". Eu uso remold porque em chão e no pouco asfalto por aqui tem muito buraco, as chances de rasgar o pneu nalgum buraco é grande, raramente chega a 25 mil km porque rasga ou racha antes.

(Racha de velhice mesmo, resseca por idade (4 anos) e racha mais fácil nalguns impactos)

Tem pneu remold que por ter borracha mais macia as vezes rasga fácil quando está quente e com calibragem baixa numas curvas, aí é burrice do dono, pneu submetido a peso ou velocidade (E isso é relativo à calibragem) precisa ser mais durável, então se for usar remold, vai ter que usar sempre peso baixo no carro e calibragem correta (Digamos 30 psi ou pouco mais, em aro 14 nunca se usa menos que 28 em caso de borracha macia, porque pneu mais murcho dobra e retorce mais). Veja nas curvas o quanto o pneu dança pra cada lado: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7n007Dmfb8 Se calibrar mais, ele torce menos, borracha macia então precisa calibragem maior. Só que perde um pouco a área de contato com o solo em caso de curvas rápidas.

O pneu remold bem feito via de regra serve pra quem viaja sem peso (Carro de 1000 a 1200km no caso desse r14), em velocidade normal (80-110km/h) em pista quente pro nível do Brasil (50°C no asfalto), sem curvas fechadas, sem arrancadas e freiadas bruscas, ou seja, serve pra 90% das pessoas, mas não serve pros moleques que precisam arrancar patinando, fazer curvas a 130km/h, carregando 4 marmanjo suado e mais 300kg em lixo de som automotivo.

Se seus pneus chegam aos 25 mil km antes de ressecar, digo, se vão pro lixo por ficar careca e não por acidentes diversos ou idade, então o remold vai te decepcionar.

Mas se seus pneus vão pro lixo porque ressecaram de velho, ou amassados/batidas diversas (Buracos em ruas brasileiras? Não existe!), então o remold vai te servir melhor, porque a vida útil prevista é menor mas só quando há uso massivo.

Se anda digamos 10 mil km por ano (Ou 1000km por mês), pega uma porcaria barata tipo Rosava ou outro do leste europeu mas evita remold. Já se roda 100km por mês, seja feliz com remold, vai mandar ele pro lixo daqui 4 anos porque ressecou, e um original iria pro lixo em 4,5 anos por ressecamento, ou seja, 10% a mais de durabilidade PARADO, mas custando 30% a mais.

Cuida que tem pneu recapado, isso não é remoldagem. A remoldagem troca a capa toda do pneu, não só a banda de rodagem, então é básico só comprar o que tem selo do inmetro e tem garantia tipo 1 ano, porque tem muito produto barato que na verdade não é remold e sim outros processos (Estes servem pra carretinhas, ou pra carro de coleção ou senhorinha que fica mais parado que andando, e quando anda mal chega a 60km/h, pra isso é burrice comprar pneu de R$ 250 se um de R$ 130 vai ressecar e rachar no mesmo tempo, e resolver a necessidade de movimentação de qualquer jeito).

Problemas de bolhas e descolamento da banda remoldada são coisa de marca vagabunda ou de uso burro tipo baixa calibragem pro peso (No caso do Onix r14, prefira 32 do que 28 psi caso use remold, mesmo com carro vazio, porque 28 psi em curvas a 100km/h gera uma torções que com calor poderia gerar descolamento da borracha mal vulcanizada sobre o pneu), não é intrínseco do remold.",True,0,1506902794,,False,0,dns2k4x,False,t3_73n0kw,t1_dnrwqvv,/r/brasil/comments/73n0kw/preciso_trocar_os_pneus_do_carro/dns2k4x/,1509220266,2,False,brasil,t5_2qh9i,

I disagree with you. Beams are common in sci-fi and cyberpunk games and film. I've seen many beam cannons, beam lasers, beam rifles, etc. I'd go so far to say that 25+% of weapons have some sort of beam.

The alien metals have been described in-game as both sturdy and lightweight.

Arthur90,,,"I live here. The problem with the idea that being independent is somehow the key to a happier nation is that it isn't. A happy nation is one that has a good economy, which creates jobs, stability and industry. Independence, for lack of a better term, is overrated. This is especially true for smaller countries.

I've lived in a lot of places in my time, and I'll never forget the few that are now either stagnant or regressing decades after winning independence​ because it took a while for the people to realise that they can no longer depend on the support, infrastructure and protection of the bigger animal they seceded from.

As for average joes, no - I do not consider myself one. Not out of a false sense of superiority or snobbery, but because I try to approach these sort of situations as objectively as I can, leaving out emotional influence as best as I can. The average joe to me is one of the many people I spoke to that voted in support of Brexit, for instance, who stood by their decision because of delusions that were hammered into their head by confirmation bias and media. People that genuinely, even after the fact,.believe that they have improved their nation despite all signs pointing to the contrary.

The truth is, the more you talk to the common folk not fortunate or wealthy enough to afford an education, who form their opinions based on collectivism and their own misconstrued interpretations of what is going on around them, the more you begin to doubt that the average voter really has the country's best interests in mind - they can't even be bothered to research them. 

I need to go so I'll brief: the other problem with the idea that Catalans should have the right to secede if it's what they want is that such a decision will affect not only them, but all of Spain and Europe's economy, and not in a good way.

Erratic85,ES-CT,seditious af — kill them with love,"&gt; I think the fallacy here is that independence will solve all these problems and separate Catalans from Spaniards.

The interesting thing, in fact, is that catalans do this too to fix Spain! Because albeit Spain has been in the EU for a lot of time, it's an 40yo only democratic country, that hasn't even judged the crimes of it's fascist past, and where because of that, the actual fascsists can feel very much integrated into the main parties —because the main parties won't even care, as they benefit from those massive votes.

I mean, in the EU you have the 2nd country in the world in number of unopened mass graves. How can the EU be ok with that? Well, if enough spaniards —and catalans, and basques— shut up, no one will ever know nor care, right?!

Spain is virtually held by the facsits, by fear. And catalans, today, putting themselves out there, showed Spain how many closet fascist spaniards they had: way more than they believed. People in Spain, and their mainstream media, agreed today —against the rest of the world's opinion— that the police charges were cool. Many people also were happy to see them enforced that way. And the worriest of it all: the prime minister denies them even happening.

The entire country is sick, but they just won't fix it as long they can blame thing son their little scapegoats, like us. So, while it may seem the opposite, please understand that catalans are actually trying to solve by themselves what the EU has overlooked for so many years: that they've got an oppresive state in their core.

In other words, when the frame isn't right, normal rules don't apply. If Spain was an ok country it wouldn't oppress it's minorities, but cherish them. And even if it's slightly... it matters! You can't argue that we haven't it ""that bad"", that's like telling a woman or somone of color not asking for 100% equal rights because ""it's not that bad"". It's not that bad... to you!

That's why I think that there needs to be a local-ish division. If you can run a mostly local season but with only the occasional crossover you can economize the travel to each individual team by limiting the number of crossings, allowing local teams to play at a time when they can actually be watched, and tap into natural regional/national rivalries.

No US city is rivals with London. There's very little history there. But, if there's one in London, York, Edinburgh/Glasgow, Dublin, and a couple of others then you'll have a packet of teams that can play most of the season against each other only crossing over back and forth rarely. You have the early start slot for that week's one or two crossover bouts and let the rest run as usual.

But, long run I doubt that the pro teams in Europe will be feasible if kids don't play the sport growing up.

Hambr,,,"&gt; Sobre os ataques, isso (dependendo do ataque) já é ilegal, não é restringindo uma opinião não agressiva que vai impedir os ataques.
&gt; E por último, infelizmente é a sociedade em que vivemos, onde pessoas não aceitam nada fora da norma social, e não temos como obrigá-las a aceitar. A única coisa que a gente pode obrigar (ambos os lados) é que o discurso não passe pra violência, e pra mim isso já é o suficiente.

Parece que nossa discordância está mais na forma como enxergamos a mesmo situação. Eu não acho que seja um caso legítimo de cunho de aceitação social. Essa polêmica começou com movimentos políticos aproveitando dessas manifestações artísticas para justificar as besteiras e propostas de seus candidatos, nesse caso, o Bolsonaro. Em grande parte quem está fazendo essa celeuma toda são os apoiadores de bolsonaro e o MBL.

É esse o problema, porque eles estão apelando para o controverso ""bons costumes"", com o propósito de comover e criar um clima de indignação social pra colocar seus opositores contra a sociedade. E fazem isso sem nenhum escrúpulo ou preocupação com a imagem dessas pessoas envolvidas, como a mãe e a criança.

É um jogo sujo, pois estão criando essa polêmica em coisas que não chamariam nenhuma atenção se estivesse fora desse contexto político. É por isso que os jornalistas e escritores precisam ter cautela ao falar das vítimas dessa manobra política, pra não contribuir e direcionar o ódio da sociedade contra pessoas inocentes, como a criança e sua mãe.

The 500 didn't even cover airfare! Much less rental, food and other expenses. My peers who chose a local internship were paid roughly 700 to a thousand per month. 

So compared to them, in terms of money, I lost about five k or more. I also didn't build the same local company connections that some of them did which led to permanent employment after graduation. So that's the bad part. 

Now the good part. You'll see a lot more, meet a lot more people from all over the world. I made a huge number of friends from South America, Europe and the us. Not to mention local kiwis of course and Malaysians. You see ppl on Reddit complaining about singapore? Having any stint overseas gets you a way better perspective. I can safely say I will never want to work or retire in New Zealand and this is an informed choice weighing the pros and cons. It's fun as a holiday destination for sure. 

So if you can take the financial hit, which ate up most of my ns savings, do go ahead and do that overseas internship. It will broaden your mind.

Erratic85,,,"&gt;I'd say your question is a fairly loaded one. To be honest, when I think of 'police brutality' I think of the US. 

But nobody seems to question themselves that those police and the people behind the whole thing should be prosecuted for this. Don't they mention it because they take it for granted, that those people will be prosecuted? Or because they just lack any knowledge about how that part of a country should work in a quality democracy?

I mean, when you talk about police brutality in the US, you know those people are going to be prosecuted *harshly* (when caught badly enough).

Why aren't people and parties in the EU pushing for this being prosecuted, but instead asking for dialogue? (Or are they going to?) You can't dialogue with people that think this is ok in a democracy —in the same way you don't get a corrupt cop and give him a talk instead of jailing or firing him, no?",True,0,1506910922,,False,0,dns8jym,True,t3_73peei,t1_dns3vqi,/r/AskEurope/comments/73peei/why_do_so_many_europeans_seem_to_believe_that/dns8jym/,1509223418,0,False,AskEurope,t5_2uayg,
Five_Decades,,,"&gt; Today's civilization is based upon fossil fuels. Although hopes are high for various renewables, they can't provide an energy level concentrated enough to be worth anything significant, and things like Thorium and Fusion are all talks with nobody actually doing it seriously.

Disagree. There is ample energy on earth in the form of nuclear fission. There is also virtually endless energy in solar and wind. Energy demands do not go up much among wealthy nations, and there is enough potential energy from solar, wind and nuclear fission to power thousands of earths. 

&gt; However, there is a possibility that we do not get there. Vernor Vinge talked about a cyclical civilization if we don't have singularity, and I wrote before that because of resource depletion , once we lose this drive we won't make it.

Never heard this idea from Vinge. What did he mean by cyclical civilization? 

&gt; Whenever the 'have-nots' obtained tech which was at a par with the haves, the results were not great for the haves, like Haiti in the 1800s, Algeria in the 1960s and Vietnam.

Disagree. The US became a technological superpower that became stronger then Europe. Japan and South Korea have industrialized. The world is better off for all these things. The rise of China is good for the world because China contributes to science and tech. 

&gt; To keep the world stable, and ensure resources are set to the core of civilization in order to fuel the Tech advances, it is very important to keep the tech level high and deny them to poorer countries who want a slice of the pie.

Not possible, the tech will leak out. Besides, tech provide higher standards of living, so governments are not going to outlaw them. Besides the richer and more advanced the world the better. 

&gt; Right now, AI advances, while great, is stalled because computing power increase has stalled following the end of Moore's law. Various methods are being tried, but to reach Singularity, etc computing power has to increase by a factor of 10^20 or more, which are not obtainable by the various ways being tried now.

Kurzweil takes it for granted that new tech will come to replace transistors. 10^30 cps for $1000 around 2060. 

Also the software for AI is getting better too. Elon Musk talked about how AI is approaching from a double exponential. One one hand hardware is getting exponentially better, on the other software is getting much better (not sure if software is getting exponentially better or not though).

&gt; 
If the tech progress stops and the poorer countries catch up, the Advanced World will be attacked and destroyed by the Poorer World, who showed its appreciation and gratefulness about bringing them out from Stone Age by killing as many Westerners as possible and robbing their properties.

If you would punish your people with force because they are essentially protesting through voting, you’re doing nothing but adding fuel to their fire and generating sympathy for them.

should work as a deterrent, right? Of course, the deterrent will only come into action if the north completes its programs. 

I mean, shit, think of this in the following way: 

US dislikes leaders? Gone. 

US dislikes democracies? Gone. 

US dislikes foreign countries? suddenly, a revolution appears. 

North korea has the nuke? US suddenly does not set a foot in there, and actively works with them to have the nuke not fired. 

The problem is not the nukear program. It is implemented with the same intentions as the israeli nuke program, namely, if you take our country away from us, we will turn you to ashes. Wanna try? Look at the japanese, they took two nukes, and now they make hentai, and lust after schoolgirls. 

BUt strangely enough, that seems to stop american interferrance dead in its tracks. 

As long as america holds combined arms maneuvers with south korea, you will not get them to give up their nukes. that is the ONLY defense they have. They have a massive case of paranoia, but hey, it's justified in their eyes. A neutral case would be, install one nuke in the west coast of america, like, lets say seattle, one in the east coast, one in south korea, and then base the peace guarantees the US is willing to give on those. I mean, it sounds stupid, but history proves them right. every other country that gave up nukes and dared to speak up against america was mysteriously dealt with, except the countries that have nukes. 

wanna proof? 

https://theintercept.com/2017/08/25/north-korea-keeps-saying-it-might-give-up-its-nuclear-weapons-but-most-news-outlets-wont-tell-you-that/

""With that in mind, here’s Kim’s statement on July 4:

    [T]he DPRK would neither put its nukes and ballistic rockets on the table of negotiations in any case nor flinch even an inch from the road of bolstering the nuclear force chosen by itself unless the U.S. hostile policy and nuclear threat to the DPRK are definitely terminated. [emphasis added]""

Their argument is self defense. 

""In the past, North Korea has pledged to renounce its nuclear weapons program. During the so-called six-party talks in 2005, all the nations involved, including North Korea, affirmed that North Korea was “committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs.” Meanwhile, the United States and North Korea agreed to “respect each other’s sovereignty, exist peacefully together, and take steps to normalize their relations.”""

Self defense is no longer needed if you don't have an agressor outside your territory. 

http://www.38north.org/2017/08/lsigal082217/

That is an actual position. 

The problem is, north america can no longer use diplomacy if the populace screams enough for war. You can say a thousand times, ""well, I don't trust their perception, they lied all the time, and they would havce to let in UN inspectors, and even then it wouldn't be sincere. "" But all that arrives at the other end is ""we are not interrested in respecting north korean sovernty, or in using diplomacy. . ""

And all the world hears is ""america screams for blood, while russia litterally says, ""dudes, negotiate it out"", and china says, ""negotiate this shit"""". 

And then the US dictates china and russia both that they better follow its orders, like little bitches, and deal with north korea, or they would be forced to. 

Not the most diplomatic solution. Leaves the door wide open to russia simply repeating, ""use dioplomacy, they want to negotiate, how fucking hard is it"", which is a serious plus point to their international appeal. 

OH, and as far as trust goes? where were the WMD's because of which you ""had"" to invade iraq, and because of which you HAD to get europe on board? Would you say, sucessfully invading an other country and reccieving no punbishment makes an opponent willing to trust you, or would you say, keeping the nukes primed just in case the americans decide to make an other ""iraq"" class human rights crime is actually not a bad idea? 

IT's a situation where america is slowly pressed into accepting that it can't start of an other war. and instead has to use diplomacy. And america does not like that one bit. because only weak countries talk. america just shows up and everybody moves out of the way.

Rarehero,300,,"&gt; Before Star Citizen I didn't even know GamesCom existed. 

That says more about you than it says about the Gamescom.


&gt; GamesCom is only important in Europe and only targets a European demographic

If you figure that because you have never heard of Gamescom before Star Citizen, you might be more self-centered than is good for you. 



&gt; which is less than half of SC's audience even with the majority of conventions and advertising done in Europe.

Maybe, although I don't remember CIG communicating any numbers. What I remember them saying is that the USA have the biggest audience, followed Germany. That doesn't make the USA or NA the majority of the entire audience, and even if so that majority won't be very large. More important than that though is the audience that CIG can reach. You say that USA should have a lot more events, and I think you also want to imply that CIG should rather attend PAX or E3 instead of Gamescom because the USA have a much larger Star Citizen fanbase. You also tell me that it is quite a problem for people at the East Coast to attend an event in LA. An evident statement. But that's why Cologne, Frankfurt, Manchester all of Western Europe is that important for CIG because we don't have that problem, at least by far not to the same degree. We might have the smaller fanbase overall, but that fanbase is a lot more compressed and CIG can reach a lot more people at once. 

You have an odd (or very convenient) way of choosing your sample sizes. Maybe we should split NA into North, West, South, East and Central and then compare these territories with Western Europe again. 


&gt; 70k is big. If you can advertise your game to 50 people for the 10th time, or 10 people for the first time, you'll probably get more new customers advertising to 10 people. 

Do you really think that the few thousand people that walk through a booth over the course of a weekend make a difference? The advertising happens mostly in the media, but the media attention scales with the size of the venue. That's what makes the Gamescom so much more important than PAX and E3. 


&gt; Your entire argument seems to be ""only Europe matters"". 

Funny, I thought the same about your argument, especially since you started to belittle the European audiences. Besides, how often have I now mentioned that I would be okay if there would be no CitizenCon on the continental mainland and that the USA should get the CitizenCon in two out of three years? Three times? Four times? But all I get from you is that CIG should not even attend Gamescom because everything that happens and exist outside the USA is insignificant and irrelevant in your opinion.

##**Ask yourself the following questions:**

&gt;1.) Do you find yourself stuck in a guild of ""casual"" players, who expect you (*and others like you*) to do **all** the work, just so **they** can collect their unearned rewards?

&gt;2.) Do you earn 600 raid-tickets for your guild (by spending at least that much total-energy in-game), **every single day**, only to find that the majority of your guildmates don't?

&gt;3.) Would you like to join a **fun**, yet **dedicated** SWGoH guild, that currently farms **both** heroic-level raid-types, with ease, **attacks the Territory Battles map successfully**, and is chock **full** of Star Wars fans who are just as passionate as you are?

&gt;4.) Maybe you'd like to be part of a 87.5-millon Total-GP guild whose **average** guild-member contributes 600 raid-tickets every single day, has 118 activated-toons, 72x 7-Star toons, 16x Gear-XI toons, has an average Arena-Rank of 129, a Fleet-Rank of 190, has won 4,931 Galactic War battles, and has donated 1,012 gear-pieces ?!?

&gt;5.) Or, maybe you've **already** acquired most of the ""limited-availability"" toons (*like Darth Vader, Grand Master Yoda, (Raid) Han Solo, Emperor Palpatine, General Kenobi, R2-D2, Grand Admiral Thrawn, and BB-8*), and you have them **all** at 7-Stars ?!?

&gt;6.) Perhaps you only need a few more shards to get your **General Kenobi** toon to 7-Stars, but your guild simply doesn't raid enough for you to get there ?!?

&gt;7.)  Do you already have a **7-Star Commander Luke Skywalker** toon (*along with HRScout, HRSoldier, five Rogue One Toons and five Phoenix Squadron toons*), and are you **actually** prepared for Territory Battles ?!?!?!?

##**If you can answer ""yes,"" to many of the questions I just asked, then the United Merica guild is** ***exactly*** **what you're looking for !!!**

&gt;""United Merica"" (UM) is a dedicated, US-based, heroic-raids farming-guild, with a reset-time of 6:30 pm Eastern US [UTC 10:30 pm] (currently 7:30 pm EDT).

&gt;&gt;We are part of the MLCN Alliance (a union of the ""Malevolent Marauders"" and ""La Cosa Nostra"" Alliances).  We use Discord for **all** our communications, and **require** a working SWGoH.gg-profile for tracking- and TB-purposes.

&gt;&gt;Most of our UM guild-members are located in the 48 contiguous United States, with a couple of our members located in Europe as well as one in Australia!

&gt;&gt;Our average guild-member has been a Level-85 player for quite some time, currently has a Total Galactic Power rating of 1.75-million, 118 activated-toons (with more than 72 at 7-Stars and more than 16 at Gear-XI), an Arena-Rank of 129, a Fleet-Rank better than 190, 4,931 GW victories, and 1,012 gear-donations.

&gt;&gt;**And those are just our averages !!!**

####**Our recruitment-goals are simple:**

&gt;1. Improve our guild (first and foremost).

&gt;2. Continue improving ourselves for ""Territory Battles.""  And,

&gt;3. Replace a couple of our current members who were more ""casual"" players, and have been moved to a different guild, within our Alliance.

###**At a Minimum, an Ideal Candidate for United Merica Guild-Membership Would be:**

&gt; + Daily-Active, Long-Time Level-85 Player
&gt; + Daily 600 Energy-Contribution
&gt; + Minimum Total Galactic Power of 1.5-million
&gt; + Minimum Arena-Rank of between 1 and 150
&gt; + Minimum Fleet Rank of between 1 and 200
&gt; + At Least 65x Toons at 7-Stars
&gt; + At Least 15x Toons at Gear-XI
&gt; + Have and Heavily Use Discord
&gt; + Have a Working SWGoH.gg-Profile
&gt; + Players from Around the World are Welcome
&gt; + But, All Communications are in English
&gt; + 18 Years-Old and Over ONLY (Sorry, No Minors)

####**We currently farm heroic-level rancor Pit-raids, and heroic-level AAT tank-raids:**

&gt;Our heroic-level rancor-raid (hPIT) has a 24-hour zero-damage registration-period, followed by 24-hours of free-for-all.  We rotate start-times, at 12-Noon and 9:00 pm Eastern US-Time [4:00 pm and 1:00 am UTC].

&gt;Our heroic-level AAT tank-raid (hAAT) also has a 24-hour zero-damage registration-period, followed by 24-hours of free-for-all.  Our only restriction is that if a member already has a 7-Star General Kenobi toon, they stay ouy of the top-three scores.  We rotate start-times, at 1:00pm and 10:00 pm Eastern US-Time [5:00 pm and 2:00 am UTC].

####**And what about Territory Battles, you ask?**

&gt;Best of all, we were **actively** preparing for Territory Battles, as they were being announced... not just paying ""lip-service"" to them !!!

&gt;More than half our guild unlocked the new Commander Luke Skywalker toon **on day one** !!!  In total, 35 of our members unlocked this new, rare, and downright necessary, toon, before the ""Heroe's Journey"" event closed !!!  And most of us have the other ""characters of interest"" (i.e.: HRSct and HRSol) at 7-Stars, too!

&gt;We correctly predicted that a guild full of players with CLS, HRSc, HRSo, Phoenix Squadron and Rogue One toons would be the **only** way to **maximize** the rewards associated with this newest feature.

&gt;And now, we can **proudly** say we achieved 31-, 32-, and 33-stars, during the latest TBs, respectively, and are aiming for 35 to 40 on the next one!

####**So... if all this has sparked your interest, what are you waiting for?**

&gt;Contact Me **on Discord** to Discuss Joining Our Guild.  You can friend-request me at @Hellenix#3201.

&gt;&gt;*Please include your ally-code and a link to your required SWGoH.gg-profile, so we can review your stats.*

&gt;We will only have a few spots that we want filled, and they **won't** stay open for long !!!  We will be closing recruitment at noon (EDT), on Monday, October 2nd (until the fourth Territory Battle ends).  If you fit the above criteria, **you** should be our newest member!

##So... **don't delay**.

tipf,,,"Fiz bacharelado em matemática no Brasil e hoje faço doutorado em matemática pura nos EUA. Reitero que matemática em nível superior é muito diferente de matemática no ensino médio. Vc terá que realmente entender profundamente o que vc está fazendo, não adianta decorar fórmulas ou aprender a resolver problemas de forma meia-boca como sempre é na escola. Provavelmente será bem difícil e vc terá que ralar muito.

Além disso, esteja ciente que o mercado acadêmico em matemática, isso é, o mercado para pesquisadores, é bastante supersaturado, e conseguir um emprego hoje em dia não é nada fácil, nem no Brasil, nem nos EUA, nem na Europa, nem em lugar nenhum.

Tendo dito essa parte deprimente, eu ainda acho que matemática é muito dahora e que se vc fizer o curso numa universidade *boa* (e se esforçar, sem empurrar com a barriga) vc vai aprender muita coisa profunda que foi fruto de esforço da genialidade humana durante milênios, e são coisas muito bonitas (apesar de poucos professores conseguirem mostrar isso bem).

I have lived in the expat community for years, half of all the expats I have meet think about moving to English speaking countries only. This also applies to students. In spite of the outstanding level of German/Dutch/French speaking universities people are flocking to the UK for studies. 

I would love to see EU funding for English lessons in all countries.  This would drastically encourage people moving to other countries for work, marrying other nationalities, buying vacation houses in other EU countries, developing EU level media etc.

It could even be that EU schools for english are operated throughout Europe. Sounds crazy? It isn't. Here are some back-of-the-envelope calculations: there are approximately 60 million teenagers (10-20 years old). Assume that it takes 30 euros per month for english classes, the annual budget for the project would be 30(euro/month)*12(months)*60M(people) ~= 22Billion euro

This is just 0.1% of the EU 16trillion GDP. Maybe the 30 euro budget is off, but double that and it is still ok. Plus economies of scale should really kick at this level.

Do we need to have an original hard copy of something in front of us for it to be verifiable?

&gt;Can you explain why this 4 decades old quote is relevant, or any similar quote at that?

What's been found since 1982 that has greatly cleared up what's true about human origins?

&gt;Evidence is a whole package, you dont get to choose favorites.

Are you yourself even convinced that there's universal common descent if you aren't sure how many times life has come from non-life? What are we even debating?

&gt;They didnt.

What's limited to just a few drawings if you spend more than 5 minutes [here](http://s8int.com/dinolit1.html) and [here](http://www.genesispark.com/exhibits/evidence/historical/dragons/) and scroll through various pages?

What's limited to art at all if you see a Merriam Webster's definition for dragon [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dragon) and study H8577 [here](http://lexiconcordance.com/hebrew/8577.html) and if The Travels of Marco Polo suggest that there were people hunting dinosaurs over 50 feet in length less than 1,000 years ago in it and if Marco Polo claimed a Chinese Emperor had a number of dragons which were used to pull his chariots in parades and if dragons are mentioned as very rare but still living creatures in a 16th century four-volume encyclopedia entitled Historiae Animalium and if a 16th century work called the Aberdeen Bestiary refers to dragons as if they existed and could kill elephants and if there is a city in France called Nerluc that was renamed in honor of a dragon with a horned head being killed there and if Herodotus, Josephus, Aelian, Mela, Ammianus, Esarhaddon's inscription, anonymous 4'th century Coptic monks, Matthew of Edessa and more not all attest the existence of flying reptiles? 

&gt;Its no different from humans finding helicopters and computers in Egyptian art.

What if there was ancient high technology in Egypt?

&gt;Why not when almost every civilization on Earth has stories, drawings, etc. of us doing exactly that?

Of who doing what?

How familiar are you with Genesis 6:4 and a concept of nephilim?

Compare Genesis 6:4 with 1 Enoch and Jubilees and see how high they are listed here? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls#Biblical_books_found

Doesn't it seem like someone is trying to suppress stuff like 1 Enoch and Jubilees if they are highly represented among the Dead Sea Scrolls and yet they are generally unknown in the world and shunned by even synagogues &amp; churches? See what is said here and notice mention of Mount Hermon? http://qbible.com/enoch/7.html

What are we left to believe if there are still huge monolithic stones nearby Mount Hermon including a huge ancient platform that others later built on top of and also other ancient stone blocks that are upwards of 1200 tons? What do people ever learn about in public school? https://www.bing.com/search?q=giant+lebanon+blocks&amp;PC=U316&amp;FORM=CHROMN

I might have came across wrong and figure evolution happens and even figure humans and chimps share common ancestry, but what if people are generally looking at stuff backwards? Perhaps chimpanzees are actually the product of cutting of roots or gene splicing. How suspicious if 1 Enoch suggests that fallen angels descended on Mt Hermon and had children with women and taught about a number of things including something called the cutting of roots?

I can also give you my own personal anecdotal evidence, for whatever you think that's worth. In the past three years, since I've been diffusing the oils and using them topically, I've had *one* cold. I haven't had a single respiratory infection, and I used to get them regularly. I haven't had the flu. I've gone off my migraine medication and my endometriosis medication, and I've only needed my asthma inhaler a handful of times since then, and only when I travel to the East Coast where the humidity affects my lungs. My migraines have cut down to once every few months, when I used to get them two or three times per month. My medical doctor even told me to use peppermint oil topically for them when she smelled clary sage on me and discovered I use EOs. Because of my endometriosis, I used to get menstrual cycles so severe, I'd be curled up in bed in the fetal position for a week, unable to move. It was basically the equivalent of being in labor for a solid week every single month. My cycles are now considerably lighter, considerably shorter, and when using the oils topically, pain-free. I call clary sage my miracle oil, because the difference is that drastic. I'm not on any prescription medication at all anymore, and my quality of life is much better. They're not a cure-all, and a lot of people don't use them safely, but I don't need painkillers (OTC or prescription), cold/flu/sinus medication, or migraine medication anymore. I don't have to visit the doctor every few months for prescription refills, either. Obviously, my experience isn't worth much, but they've been a major, major blessing for me.

Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. The sport is known to be fast-paced and physical, with teams usually consisting of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team.

Ice hockey is most popular in Canada, central and eastern Europe, Scandinavia, and the northern regions of the United States. Ice hockey is the official national winter sport of Canada, and enjoys immense popularity; alongside Canada, ice hockey is the most popular winter sport in Belarus, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Latvia, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland.

&gt; Tub Ring is a tornado of genres mixing punk, classical, surf, a-capella, hardcore, pop, and whatever else crosses their path into one cohesive blend of rock.

&gt; Forging this sound in 2001, Tub Ring has been a force of nature in the left-of-center world of music, building momentum and inertia with every day that passes. The band's first album of avant-garde pop, Drake Equation, was produced by Mr. Bungle's Trey Spruance. Since, Tub Ring has released a total of 4 albums and a DVD/B-Side double pack.

&gt; With each album charting into double digits on the CMJ Top 200, Tub Ring's music has also been featured on Fox Sports, Xbox 360's ""Amp Snow Boarder 3"", various MTV/MTV2 programs, Spike and Mike's Twisted Animation films, and several Mt. Dew commercials. Most recently, Tub Ring played live in the TRL room on MTV2, and was featured in the MTV reality based contest show ""Dew Circuit Breakout"".

&gt; Tub Ring has created an enormous underground market with their bizarre genre of spazzed pop rock, with no financial help, no manager, NOTHING... except hard work, non-stop touring, and inventive song writing with intelligent lyrics. Clocking in at over 150 shows per year from 2001 to 2009 throughout North America, Europe and Japan, there are few bands that can match Tub Ring's determination and commitment to music. Touring partners include Mindless Self Indulgence, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Kill Hannah, Dog Fashion Disco, Clutch, Karate High School, Black Light Burns, Foxy Shazam!, and more!

Sonols,,,"&gt; Edit: Just to be clear there's a reason [...] MLK and Malcolm X all knew violent protest was counterproductive AF. Please don't do it.

What the hell kind of white-washed history is this? The civil rights movement caused many riots, which forced change.

[Long hot summer of 67 is famous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_hot_summer_of_1967). 

[Let us look at Detroit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_Detroit_riot). What was the aftermath?

* The government began to hire minorities, even the police.
* Requirements for entry level jobs where lowered to ensure that blacks without education could get more jobs
* Anti segregation housing laws where put in place
* A year after the riots and some change implemented, a larger portion of the population thought that race relations where improving

Nobody likes violence, but that does not mean we make a revision of history. If the people never took arms, we would be living under kings and lords right now.

To make a connection between the protests in modern day USA and in Europe, we can see what the left have done by showing up in droves. This weekend, in Göteborg, a neo nazi organization officially gave in. They did their nazi protest, 500 people, but 10.000 counter protesters showed up. Rocks where thrown, light injuries was sustained. The aftermath was that the nazi organization dropped a press release. They stated that they no longer want to do these kind of rallies, which makes the LGQT and minorities feel unsafe in their very hometowns.

I'm guessing fining is not going to prevent future clogs either. The gelatin will help drop the hop debris and particles to the bottom, and then you'll have a couple cloudy pints before having clear beer.  Of course, you'll be sucking hop material back up, and that could be the genesis of the next clog(s).

One solution is to cut off the bottom inch of your dip tube. Then you should be pulling from clear when your sediment has dropped. If you ever need a full length dip tub, you can slip a piece of silicone tubing over it for to make up the difference.

Another solution is the Clear Beer Draft System (U.S.). It's pretty much the same as a cask widget if you live in the U.K. or EU or some Commonwealth countries.

Median2,na c9,,"&gt; I'm not sure where you've read that revenue sharing necessitates franchising, but that's wrong. Look at any European sports league or even globally

Never said that, my point is that the NA teams are paying for revenue sharing as part of franchising, while you seem to be implying that the EU teams are getting it for free. 

&gt; Plus, EU can have their own deals as well, as they did with BMW for the EU Finals. There's plenty of options to generate revenue in EU.

It's not about Riot EU making money, it's about revenue sharing. Did the EU teams get a cut of the deal with BMW?

&gt; Look at what happened to SK, to Origen, etc. Every team has the chance of having a horrible split, TSM included.

Comparing those two teams to TSM is just, laughable. Those two orgs were broke as hell and run terribly. Ofc there's a ""chance,"" but you don't pay 10 Mil + for something that is less than a percents chance of happening. 

&gt; The NA teams will easily get over 1 million per split, excluding sponsors. Unless league dies within 3-4 years, I don't see what would speak against paying the fee if the league gets franchised. As Ocelote said in his video, EU orgs take a greater risk by having promotions/relegations, and so there also needs to be a greater rewards for an org to remain on top. It wouldn't make sense to have less support in a league with more competition and risk.

Eu teams take a greater risk but aren't investing remotely as much money... Are you saying that the EU teams would pay 10 mill for franchising? I mean ffs, the EU fans are the ones who don't want franchising too, if the orgs should be mad at anyone for EU not franchising, it should be the fans. 

&gt; Depends on the team. EU orgs still face the threat of being relegated. And we've seen in traditional sports that even teams that have been good for decades can get relegated

Let me rephrase that. TSM, C9, CLG, IMT are getting a Godawful deal, and teams like G2, and FNC, the endemic EU teams with almost no shot of getting relegated, are making away like absolute bandits. 

If things actually are going the way you describe, it seems like EU fans, teams, and orgs, should have VERY little to complain about, so care to explain what all the crying about EU dying has been about?

Gotta say though, I'm enjoying your in depth step by step answers, very thorough and informative. 

Edit: Also, one last thing, I just want to point out that one of the caveats that pushed UEFA to share revenues was...""The most successful members of federations want a bigger share of the money earned by
the  federations,  **threatening  otherwise  to  leave  the  federations  and  set  up  their  own
championships**,"" which frankly doesn't apply to League of Legends. The EU orgs can't just go and open their own league, so again, I think LoL is a weird example and an exception in a lot of ways because they own the rights to the sport, as well as the league.

ElitistRobot,liberal,Captain Liberal McKickass,"&gt; Canada made the right call in 1995 in allowing a vote and yes it was so damn close, but the result was that there was no violence and the separatist movement slithered away for a long time.

In all likelihood, that vote was *controlled*. There was also a lot of *overt* manipulation of the vote by the government (the 'oui/non' controversy).

&gt;  if the Trudeau Liberals 

Okay, so you're an outsider. 

&gt; decide to be silent on this matter, it is done so at peril

No, I expect us to be at *least* as professional and patient handling this as we can manage for Donald Trump. /:D

&gt; Some may say that Trudeau senior sent in the army to Quebec but that was after violence had broken out.

I'm having trouble gauging you in this conversation. The Night of Long Knives is actually *great* criticism of Trudeau Sr, and the Liberals. *That* is the part you should be politicizing. 

&gt; The Trudeau Liberals should speak up and use whatever influence they have in Europe to state this violence needs to stop and the vote should proceed.

It sounds like you're pretty bored with what you do. You've got the right mindset being a pentester, but it sounds like you need more of a challenge in your life. If you want to move into a more interesting area of security, I'd recommend working on your programming skills, particular C and assembly, and maybe a scripting language. From there, look into reverse engineering, vulnerability research, application security, or malware analysis. 

Buy [this](https://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm) book to start. It's a little old, but it's a great introduction to low level hacking. It starts off with C and assembly, and takes you through the basics of software exploitation, crypto, networking, etc. You can download an ISO from the book's website that will boot into a Linux distro to work in. 

For reverse engineering, you can download a demo version of the IDA Pro disassembler, or look into similar tools such as Binary Ninja, Hopper Disassembler, or Radare2. Learning reversing is a great skill to have in security. I like [this](https://beginners.re/) book... it's pretty solid and free to boot. 

There are a lot more resources [here](https://github.com/Hack-with-Github/Awesome-Hacking). It's a curated GitHub list of hacking/security resources.

There's a number of directions you can go as you learn. It really depends on what the market is like where you live, but having a solid foundation in reversing and low level hacking is helpful if you want to move into more technical roles. Also, having an understanding of OS and compiler internals is helpful too.

demetri76,AUDINA,Dmitry Oss | Mile High SimRacing #76,"**PQ:**
This track reminds me of Nords being quite narrow at many places and having a few very unforgiving curbs and some elevation changes and I need to say that I'm no good at Nords. I also think I only ran one race in a GT car on Zandvoort before, it was a while ago on some public server and the only thing I remembered was that I was sandbagging it pretty badly, so I didn't look with a lot of optimism to this particular race. I started doing PQ laps only on Wednesday and was about a second slower than /u/CamsX and another Audi from EU (I think it was Petrol), which was somewhat troubling given that they set their times in just a handful of laps and I didn't see any glaring mistakes from myself. But in the next couple of days I improved my PQ time by nearly a second and a half thanks to getting used to the track and a better setup. Kudos to /u/oscarpink for setup hints.

**Quali:**
I knew that softs would have an edge in the qualifying but they would also overheat very quickly, so my strategy was to make three 5-lap stints with just two fast laps each using a lap between them to cool the tires down. I set a decent time on my first stint but it was far from a perfect lap, so I knew I could do better. The second stint I botched completely and even spun out on lap 4, almost setting my tires on fire from the looks of it, so I pitted and went for the last stint still holding P1 but with just 3 tenths of advantage over Camilo at P2. This time I managed to put down a very good first fast lap improving my PB by 2 tenths and growing the gap to P2 to 7 tenths, so I felt safe and pitted right away to go out and do a few more training laps on race setup.

**Race:**
The start was not the best, but good enough to keep Camilo behind me coming to T1. Unfortunately /u/WillianBaraviera had some hardware issues and DC'ed right after the start. I'm pretty sure we would've made a great threesome otherwise. With Willian out my job was reduced to keeping Camilo behind and thanks to this great track layout it was not very hard to do. I was running a relatively low rear wing and I had a bit of rear damage from our slight touch on lap 1, so I was probably a bit too cautious and I couldn't get away from Camilo at all. I think the whole first half of the race went with him being within 0.5-1 second behind me.

Then I realized that I should move my BB forward a notch to compensate for the damage and it made things somewhat better as I was no longer oversteering into Renaultbocht and the next corner. Should've done that earlier, but oh well. I made the gap of about two seconds when a backmarker, /u/seemonkey, came by and I don't know what he was thinking about but the held me from Scheivlak till the last corner and didn't move over despite me shouting ""Blue flags"" into Discord. Dude, when you're blueflagged and going 3 seconds off the pace you better let the leading car pass, especially on a track like this one. I think that lap was the most intense moment of the race as I had to pass santiclaws as if I was actually racing him and also had Camilo quickly seizing the opportunity to catch up and and running right behind me. We went out of the last turn finally leaving the stubborn backmarker behind with mere .1s between us. But as I wrote I was running a rather low downforce setup and Camilo must have had higher rear aero or maybe his 6th gear was taller as he was unable to get any advantage of being in my slipstream. Seeing that was a big relief for me.

After that, I kept creeping away little by little and when I saw him turning into pits in my mirror I decided to pit on the next lap too even though I finally had a clear track ahead of me as I had no idea how long his pit stop was and was afraid of being undercut. It turned out that Camilo spent about 6 seconds longer than me there as I went out of the pits having about 8 seconds of handicap despite my mediocre inlap.I don't think there was anything else to remember after that, as I was simply running my own pace slowly growing the gap from P2, so the rest of the race was pretty uneventful with no more close calls against guys being lapped. Thanks everyone who paid attention to their mirrors and respected blue flags. I also tried to set the best lap of the race, but the tires were already too worn out as was I, so that one goes to /u/CaptJulian who was got unlucky in the end.

Too bad my teammate /u/MrCatPiss had somebody distracting him at the end of lap 1 while he was comfortably running 5th and he had to nearly stop and let the whole pack pass. Could've been another podium finish for him otherwise with all those guys ahead of him going off for one reason or another. Let those family members of you know that when it's an ACRL race going they shall not bother you unless there's a fire or any other emergency :)

It was widely used in warfare by the 1200s in China and Europe. Gun powder that is.

Definitive proof of rocketry prior to the 1300s isn't really there. Europeans(Italians) used some contraption that launched gun powder projectiles by 1380 AD but whether it was rockets or grenades we do not now. 

The Chinese(and Mongols) could have used them as early as the 1200s but yet again we have nothing more than vague descriptions of this, it doesn't specify whether or not these were true rockets vs. simply grenade launchers. 

By the early 1300s though it was definitely used in China and in Mongol lands. Didn't even take a 100 years for it to spread to Europe, *if* it ever was to begin with.

ZCnegan,,,"Great answer, thanks. 

&gt; I think you are confusing different views you have come across, maybe many which aren't backed by evidence.

This is the problem. What sources, basically everywhere outside of mgtow says women are equal to men or even stronger and better. On the tv, on the news, at school, college, and now the workplace. Not only they try to hammer those ideas in your head they also attack all men and women who question it, and men are branded as nazis. Im usually not branded as a nazi because Im southern european. Im just branded as a bad person if I expose anything that might seem like ""well perhaps women are not as good as men in combat situations"". I tell you I never said anything that extreme.
I once refused to go out with a group once i noticed only women were going out, and stupidily i said ""no guys are going, so this is not for me"". You know what i mean? These girls started spreading a rumour that im mysoginist, and suddenly the whole group was contaminated. I dont see men ever taking such intrigue and toxic stances that have such a terrible effects on society. For example, I have 2 degrees, but Im choosing simple jobs because I cant stand working with the average sociopath woman that turns working places into a soap opera. It affects productivity of the companies. Where companies that are more male oriented have no such conflicts and are very functional and driven.

Recently i worked in a company that had only two women working there. It was a very quiet place and very comfortable. This seems already that we are living in a different age. All the rest of the company are men. These two ladies that were even good looking, men completely ignored them. What it seems that before it was a complete priviledged situation for women, where they would be spoiled and helped is now turning into an nonspoken rule for men to let women to fend for themselves because of all the problems that it has caused (and that the media and society refuses to address directly). I remember how bad it was when women in the workplace when they wanted to turn everyone against a man. They are surely capable of very low things that even the most dishonorable man is not. Suddenly things are changing. And women are no longer put in a pedestal as men are waking up. 2 hot women in the middle of a group of men would turn into tyrant queens. Im happy its getting better.

The evidence is overwhelming, and that is precisely why men go mgtow despite our nature constantly stimulating us to pursue women and be slaves. It is because of this ""lack of evidence"" or the truths that are censored, branded as mysoginistic. It is the same as you getting bitten by snakes, but everyone is saying in a dogmatic way, that snakes are great for you. It makes you vehemently anti-snake lol, and anti everyone that says snakes are ok. Not all snakes are like that. But surely a large percentage are like that. Large enough to make you avoid all of them.

&gt;Do you mean treated equally, have equal access to resources?

I mean different in every sense. Look at nature, why a chameleon as more chances of survival than a lizard. Cunning and manipulation is a strenght. And its a strenght men didnt need evolutionary speaking to survive. As for women thats all they had. Men have muscles, and we rely on that.

&gt;You're confusing science backed evidence and perspectives of internet groups

Most men grow up very aware of the priviledges of women, but in the times of no internet, all this info was only passed by your father or by your uncle. And since your father is normally a guy that married, he's normally a guy that is at least partially brainwashed. This wont happen with the generation Z. We dont even have to fight with anyone. The truth of the facts is such a strong force, that the more you try to throw sand on the eyes of men the more they will want to know the truth. Well as for the internet being the cause of a mass hysteria, I would agree with you, if, as coincidence the tv and everyone else agreed with it. The thing is that men know this to be truth, see this everyday, yet society denies it (only the western society). Men go to google and write, why women this, why women that, and the answers the he knows deep inside are true with the evidence of common sense and first person experience, are there, despite what the dogmatic mainstream mentality. Its just not the other way around.

You are hallucinating to the point that you are being so racist believing Japanese are natural born haters. Your knowledge seems to be half-baked and process in very racist way in your head. I suppose you are referring to Zaitokukai I mentioned above, but as the name of the group (The Group which don't let special privilege given allow just to zainichi-korean) suggest they are againt the ""special treatments"" given to zainichi-koreans, like the official use of fictitious names. As the group is known to have naturalized Korean-Japanese, and zainichi-Europeans, their motivation is political but not racial. I'm pretty sure there are a lot of Japanese who hate Korean but its hate is more conditional (because they do sneaky stuffs like building a comfort women statue in unrelated foreign cities or erasing Japan from their maps), while Korean hate toward Japan is more unconditional, as they are the one believing Japanese is a lesser being under the influences of twisted 
Confucius ideologies.

That has nothing to do with racism, and those books are mostly facts oriented.

Banned? Yeah, South Korea banned everything they don't want to hear. South Korea is a racist nation that still banned from people to speak Japanese on TV. If you comment anything positive about Japan, you will be forced to publicly apologize in front of mass, socially terminated, and even prosecuted by laws. South Korea is an fascist nation running by mobocracy, not true democracy.

&gt; Both of them act like retards, but there's far more protests held in Japan than South Korea alone; the volume and intensity is way bigger.

As you mentioned university, and as you said, a degree in engineering gives you both good career prospects, with many companies offering graduate schemes, as well as a fallback in case of medical issues or any other concerns.

The biggest draw to modular is that the total cost for ATPL can be as low as 38k, but you could have a reasonable budget of 50-55k and still have the same licence. And this cost is spread out over time, so you aren't going to be in nearly as much debt.

Additionally, I would suggest looking at universities in Europe, where fees will be significantly lower than the UK.

HandsomeBronzillian,na c9,,"*You*:
&gt;EU decayed **because** they played less games than NA?

*What I said*:
&gt;We saw how EUW decayed in quality **when** they were playing less games than NA.

First of all: when != because

If I would have used the word ""because"", implying that the BO3 format is the only and sole deterministic cause for the region's decay, I would have to prove a strong correlation between the format change and the quality of games in the region. Assuming it is even possible to measure a region's quality empirically which, by the way, looking at how a region performed n international stage is not a good way to measure how strong that region is. Otherwise you would have to imply that vietnam is now a major region because of what GAM did.

Yes, I agree with you that OG and FNC were, probably, the strongest iterations of western teams we had in a while. But I think you getting things confused here.

When EU moved to the BO2 format, it was an **improvement**. Both EU and NA were using the BO1 format and simply didn't have enough practice to compete against koreans and that was the reason why the format was changed in the first place. EU, at that point, was already a stronger region than NA. 

Again, there's no way to measure a region's strength so that is subjective. But assuming that EU was already a stronger region, something that most people will probably agree with me, you wouldn't **expect** that, over a one year span, that fact would have changed completely and, despite EU also increasing their number of games, it would have become a totally garbage region compared to NA because they had one less game in every series than NA.

But, if more practice = more development, you should **expect** that those few games more would, gradually, make more and more of an impact up until the point where NA would have caught up to EU and surpassed it and, indeed, by the end of 2016 this subreddit was filled with posts about how BO2 fucked EU as a region and allowed NA to catch up.

Getting better is a process which heavily relies on practice and dedication. It is still a process though. Not an on-and-off switch. If you increase the amount of time you run by 10 minutes a day, you won't see improvement in the next day. It will take time, but, eventually, all that extra practice will show off.

I think they're both trying their best to gain political traction, using different methods. One is appealing to traditionalism the other to patriotism (culturism?) . I don't know if either believes this is for the best of their people, but it isn't. Unfortunately Rajoy has now legitimized the Catalonia desire for independence. And for good reason, people that are collectively targeted by police will not feel like true citizens of the nation/government that send those police. Puigdemont on the other hand used a weakened economy and increased unhappiness to further his own agenda, without considering whether that was for the best of Catalonia. 

This is a personal believe obviously, but I think Spain would've have had good chances of growing into one of the top powerhouses of Europe. But that's not going to happen when the people are busy fighting themselves instead of building their economy and enacting political reform. A unified Spain is to everyone's advantage because it increases the capacity for economical power of everyone in that nation.

Eventually, they came together around the 1940s-1950s to assert their Native American identity under the Lumbee name. Also take into account the geographical location of where modern day Lumbees live. They took the brunt of European colonialism and had to very quickly adapt to the European way of life to survive in their new world. For survival, remnants of native tribes destroyed by encroachment and disease moved to this swamp land that Europeans did not find much value in. They were joined with other ""outcasts"" such as low class whites and escaped slaves. This meant giving up their language and culture.

I am getting very weary of snide remarks about the Lumbee’s “Indianness.”  The Comanches, some Pueblos and some Mission tribes in California are largely Mexican by blood.  Some Chippewa communities are primarily French in blood and very French culturally, as well.  I don’t hear any snickers directed at these groups.  Nor do I hear anyone say that the people in a large section of northern Italy are not “real” Italians because they are largely descendants of invading German tribes.  I find American racism boring as well as annoying.""

Quote from here: 
https://nativeheritageproject.com/2012/07/17/a-report-of-research-on-lumbee-origins-by-robert-k-thomas-part-1-lost-colony-theory/ . This is a good series of blogs to better understand the circumstances and and idenity of lumbees.

Lumbees have been documented to have asserted a Native American identity as early as the 1790s (and it is assumed they have asserted this before records begun to be kept about people living along Drowning Creek/modern day Lumber River). Yes, many (I would even go as far as saying most) of them are mixed race, but so are most native americans alive today. Lumbees are, by every definition, legitimate native americans.

Lumbees are a federally recognized tribe. They were granted this by the Lumbee Act of 1956. However, this was during a period of time in the US called Termination. The US was trying very hard to terminate Native American tribes. So while Lumbees were given recognition, they were not afforded the other benefits associated with that status. Lumbees are not trying to skip the BIA process because they think they have weak evidence. It is because the Lumbee Act explicitly forbade them from doing so. Lumbees have jumped through more hoops than most Native American tribes and have proven time and time again their legitimate Native identity. They feel unfairly targeted and do not wish to waste another decade going through a system that has time and time again failed them.

Most people tend to believe what the Cherokees say about them but never go out of their way to do their own research on Lumbees. The website at the bottom of this post is a great place to start to hear the Lumbee through their own words, instead of second hand sources with agendas.

Most of you guys are upvoting the government killing a few hundred innocent people. You haven't heard anything yet. 

&gt; In addition to disease, in 1853, under the leadership of Gov. Bigler, several municipalities[12] within the State of California ordered all non-European people of California - including the Maidu - exterminated in return for a $5.00[13][14] ($134.95 in 2010 US$)[15] cash bounty for each verified male killed and a lesser cash bounty for a dead woman or child. In addition to the municipal bounty system, through funding numerous militia attacks on the native people, the resulting debt became known as the ""California War Debt"" or ""Army Appropriations Bill"".[16] In 1854 - though not entirely clear why[17][18] - Secretary of War Jefferson Davis wrote California that their 'war' expenditures could not be authorized without the original bills of sale to verify the purpose was one intended by congress.[19][20] The bill of sale for the bounty was the head. California was reimbursed $924,259.65 ($23.4M 2010US) by the United States Federal Government and again reimbursed $229,981.67 in 1861 for the intervening years.[21] Sometimes children could be sold for more than the per claim amount allowed. To maximize profits, during 'hunts' they tried to only kill children that were not old enough to work. The older children were instead enslaved[22] as provided by the Act of 1850 for the Government and Protection of Indians.[23] Assuming the $1.2M the State of California claimed in expenses for the 'War' was used entirely for $5 bounties, then this represents the death of 240,000 California natives; during that same time period the native population declined from 250,000 to less than 50,000, a comparable amount.

Cenodoxus,,,"I'm not sure it's that simple. Catalonia enjoys a privileged position on the Spanish coast with easy access to European, Middle Eastern, and African markets bordering the Mediterranean. It also gets a lot of the GDP ""credit"" for any Spanish export that goes through its ports and airports, even if the goods didn't originate within Catalonia itself. This is a point that comes up a lot when economists are trying to explain the complexities of national economies; we tend to *account* for GDP in urban areas and major entry/exit points, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the wealth involved was actually *generated* there. (Example: California often gets the GDP credit for a shipment of, say, Iowa's pork to China, but nobody in Long Beach actually raised, slaughtered, or processed the pigs.)

The reality is that not every city or region in a country is going to be a major tourist draw, not every city or region is suited to hosting major airports or ports, and not every city or region can realistically become a knowledge center. The latter is the result of an incredibly complex interaction of geography, history, culture, economy, education, and movement, and has never been successfully accomplished by a state in isolation.

[deleted],,,"In their opinion things may have gotten worse since fascism ended.

The fact that we idiotically make the ideology the most taboo and 'evil' ideology ever, along with criminalising Holocaust denial, is probably part of why they have so much appeal.

Whenever you try to analyse positives of fascism, or question the Holocaust, you are more likely to be met with state brutality, outrage, censure, termination of employment, and death threats than rational arguments and evidence to the contrary.

Not saying fascism was good, but treating its sympathisers like the apex of evil is not going to achieve what you think it will.
