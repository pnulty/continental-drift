False,t5_2s580,1,"Pull up a chair, breh.

That team he mentioned, Nirvana.Int, was one of the best Western teams ever.  It started as Ben's Friendly/Fuck Buddies with Fear, Demon, Merlini, Kuroky and Puppey.  Really, really cool team and as good as you'd expect with those players.  They got sponsored by blight, one of those really cancerous scammy orgs that infested early esports, then Nirvana.  The team had three main rivals.  

The first was the MYM Maelk/Mania/Pusher core, plus some combination of AngeL and miGGel or Playmate and Misery.  This was the team that went to TI1 as Maelk, Mania, Playmate, Demon and Misery.  They went to ESWC Paris with Babyknight, I think, and formed the core of the strong Denmark MYM Prime Nations teams.

The second rival was the various stacks built around Ducky under various names.  fnatic, enotHome, Ducky's Dream Team, Blight, LOST International... lots and lots.  The core of those teams was the Misery and Loda duo, with Misery generally playing carry and Loda playing mid, and Miracle on support.  Miracle was a Swedish player who'd been on the legendary Ks.int team with Kuroky; he and NS^ were the two best Western support players.  The final player was a bit inconsistent and Azen, miGGel, Santa and others played there.

The best Western team was the DTS team that gave us the core of TI1 Na'Vi.  Nirvana beat them occasionally, but not consistently enough.  ArtStyle, Dendi, Dread, NS^ and Light were the only team that realistically had a chance at beating the Chinese Big Three of EHOME, LGD.sGty and Nirvana.cn.  (To note here since it's appropriate: Nirvana Int, Nirvana China and Nirvana Malaysia were all under the same sponsor.  Nirvana CN was zhou, YaphetS, banana, DGC and incense, and Nirvana Malaysia was YamateH, Mushi, Ice, Net and XtiNcT.  Nirvana CN's apogee was winning WDC 2010, and Nirvana MY's was winning the Esports Thailand Cup over EHOME in a Bo1 where Mushi played the best Puck I've ever seen.)

One of the problems Nirvana.int had was that it was a split NA/EU team.  There were practice issues, I think, and Demon and Kuroky and Puppey just had a personality conflict.  Demon didn't handle direct criticism well, and Kuroky and Puppey tended I think to make things unnecessarily personal.  I know Ben's post talks about conflict between Demon and Puppey, but it was really conflict between Demon and Kuroky that broke the team up for good.  There's more information about the Puppey/Demon conflict here http://www.gosugamers.net/dota/news/11807-puppey-talks-about-nirvana-s-split including Fear playing elder statesman.  Basically, Demon goofed off, Puppey flamed, the team split and fought over which half was entitled to spots in ongoing tournaments including ESWC 2010, as well as money that the sponsor had promised.

ESWC 2010 was a tournament where 3/5ths of the roster had to be from one country.  Merlini retired right before the tournament, and Nirvana replaced him with the Russian player Azen.  Because they weren't eligible for the tournament, Kuroky and Puppey left Nirvana and formed TeamHome to compete for Russia's spot; the roster had pgg, Glody and Phe!V.  They didn't make it, though, losing to DTS, and Puppey rejoined Nv.int for the tournament, along with Korok as the last American.  Nv.int finished fourth, behind EHOME, DTS and MYM.

After the tournament Nirvana had good but not overwhelming results with Santa, Azen, Puppey, Demon and Fear.  Loveen stopped paying salaries and the team disbanded.  Demon and Fear went semi-inactive, popping up to play with MYM and LOST.Eu respectively.  Azen, Puppey and Santa joined Kuroky and Pajkatt, I think, to create the first iteration of GGnet; Puppey eventually left for Na'Vi.  Santa and Pajkatt were booted or left and Kuroky went to TI1 with Azen, Miracle (Mirakel), Kev- and Kebap.

Everything needs to be re-negotiated, re-written and 27 countries and the EU parliament have to agree upon every word.

It's not about 'willing', it's about law and treaties. It goes against EU law to negociate a trade agreement before signing a divorce. Because you can't negociate a trade agreement with a country which is still a member of the union. Not respecting the treaties would be unlawful and undemocratic and there are institutions within the EU that exist to ensure that the law and treaties are respected (European Court of Justice). It has nothing to do with sanctions but with respecting the legal framework.

Like I said elsewhere the divorce agreement will take two years at least and the trade agreement would take about 10 years. Everything is explained in details [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USTypBKEd8Y) from the perspective of an european law expert.

False,t5_2t7no,0,"Yes, if lab-grown beef takes off and replaces the slaughter-based beef industry, then the global population of cattle will decrease. The same thing happened with horses. The global population of horses peaked just before the widespread adoption of automobiles and tractors. Now horses are only raised for sport or kept by hobbyists.

This is a good thing, though. The current state of the beef industry is a huge drain on land, water, and contributes to the accumulation of greenhouse gases through methane emissions. With fewer cows, these resources can be put to better use, and what cows that do remain will likely have a much higher quality of life, since they will still be kept by hobbyists and more subsistence-based communities.

There is also a growing interest in Pleistocene re-wilding. This is the idea that we should try to reverse the negative impacts that humans have had on ecosystems, including the long-term goal of re-introducing the megafauna that have gone extinct due to human activity, or at least close ecological equivalents. Many ecologists claim that many ecological communities do not function appropriately in the absence of megafauna, because much of the native flora and fauna evolved under the influence of large mammals. This would perhaps include breeding back the aurochs that domestic cattle were bred from, and reintroducing them to wilds of Eurasia and Northern Africa.

&gt; Smash Into Pieces is an explosive rock band with worldwide aspirations – delivering their special blend of modern arena rock in a purely honest and attractive way. The young, highly ambitious five piece formed in Örebro, Sweden, has built an impressive impact and following in their relatively short existence. SMASH INTO PIECES, as the bands name go, stands for the vision they all share – the path, focus and will to realizing their career goals.

&gt; SMASH INTO PIECES truly makes modern rock, combining the phenomenal vocal and lyrical depth of Chris Adam Hedman Sörbye with the aggressive yet melodic guitar attacks from Benjamin Jennebo and Per Bergquist, and the hard hitting combination of bassist Viktor Vidlund and drummer Isak Snow.

&gt; The band reached the semifinal of the Swedish version of “Sweden got talent” in 2009 but dropped out of the competition to sign a record deal with Ninetone Records. Things however really didn’t work out as planned and the collaboration with the label came to a end after just one released single “Fading” – a song still gaining a great deal of attention and airplay, especially from the leading rock radio station Bandit 106.3.

&gt; The band picked up superb feedback from their hugely energetic live shows and in a short amount of time the band had the pleasure of sharing stage with among others Dead By April, Twisted Sisters, Teddybears Sthm, Raised Fists, Mustasch, Treat and many more.

&gt; Their first full length international album release came in 2013 with Unbreakable. Further headline tours of Sweden, Finland and the other Nordic countries followed along with support tours of the rest of Europe with Amaranthe

&gt; The second album The Apocalypse DJ was released in 2015 and another extensive tour cycle continued alongside. For the first time the band were able to complete a full headline Europe wide tour.

&gt; The third album is due for release at some point in 2016 but there has been no confirmed date at this point. The band announced that Isak Snow had left the band on 1st April 2016. Most people thinking this was a joke of some sort awaited further news. The band announced on the 6th of April that there was a new drummer that had joined the band. The only name given at this stage has shown that The Apocalypse DJ has descended and joined the band.  No other information is known at this stage. 

&gt; SMASH INTO PIECES is a must – and will definitely thrive in a larger setting – their sound much definitive says arena. Together, their talent and chemistry will not be ignored or denied. Read more on Last.fm.

Initially, I voted yes for a plethora of reasons, such as belief in Nuclear Weapons, privatization of the NHS, the social/political differences between Scotland the the rest of the UK and most importantly, I believed in securing more powers for my Government (which unlike Westminster seems to act in the peoples best interest).

Nicola Sturgeon (First Minister of Scotland) recently began preliminary negotiations with the EU regarding the status of Scotland (who had a majority remain vote) and about potentially joining the EU as an independent nation. As a result of these talks, both France and Spain have publicly stated that [if the UK leaves the EU, Scotland leaves too.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36656980). This creates far too much uncertainty about the future of an independent Scotland, and instead i think it would be better to both remain as a part of the EU and as part of the UK. We have a similar precedence from Greenland (1995) (A teritory of Denmark which voted to leave the EU, even though Denmark remained to stay), and similarly whilst the UK is part of the EU, part of the crown territories (Isles of Man for example) are not part of the EU.

With this, i think we'd be best pursuing EU membership as a devolved state, whilst remaining in the UK. With this, the UK doesn't lose it's 2nd largest economy and Scotland doesn't lose the UK or the EU. Further, it could create precedence for DevoMax, which i've always believed would be the best option in reference to Independence.

Money could have been funneled towards business to encourage growth and the creation of new jobs, which is so much more important than free college. Maybe if the university money went to the Bundswher, it wouldn't be the laughing stock of world militaries that it is now. Different counties have different priorities.

If a player is asked to be stashed 99% of the time that means in Europe for the entire next season and possibly more. The other 1% of the time its OKC asking Josh Huestis to forego his rights to a contract and sign with their D-League affiliate for a year under the premise he'd join the real roster a season later. The trade-off was that they would draft him in the first round instead of the second guaranteeing his money, just putting it off to fit their budget and roster jam. In both scenarios the player neither counts against the roster or gets paid that year.

The way you explained it to U/jennys0 doesn't work the same way. That's just drafting a player and sending them down to the D-League, not stashing. Was he opposed to that?",False,1467332972,kings,,1,Sneezus_Christ,0,,t3_4q3e49,1471070492,1,t3_4q3e49,,d4uq9fr

False,t5_2w23a,0,"I used to play brave frontier, a similar game with this scenario where new rem cards were consistently 3 months delayed.  Evos for old cards were typically 1-2 months behind that.  The powercreep was often extremely linear, even more so than pad, so it was pretty common for a unit or entire batch of units to be strictly outclassed by something released 1-2 months after it.  NA players would always be saying ""don't pull for x because x2 is coming in 2 months"" and then, ""don't pull for x2 because x3 makes it irrelevant"", etc.  Updated old units were so delayed that they were usually worthless by the time they reached NA. 

The EU server was even ~further~ behind, almost an entire year total behind JP.

So presumably as a ""solution"", the NA and EU devs started releasing completely batshit overpowered server exclusive units on par with or more powerful than whatever just got shat out of jp, that would obliterate whatever content just got localized, that was intended to challenge things released 4 months ago.  For extra cashgrab, there would sometimes be a limited time window to pull or complete shit rates but get it 100% on the 20th pull, etc.

False,t5_2ym13,0,"It's a mix of reasons for why they are leaving I imagine.  If their team was actually winning EU maybe they stick with it.  They don't look close to being able to do that, and there is no reason to believe there are other players available that could form a new roster that would have a significantly better chance to contend.

HOTS doesn't have a big enough audience to be worth carrying a mediocre team, and HOTS doesn't have enough financial incentive for top tier pros from other MOBA's to switch to HOTS whether they like the game more or not.  

I don't think the game is too casual though.  If you watched the Summer Championship between MVP_Black and Tempest, you can see that most current pro teams aren't close to that level of skill.  Certainly the average hero league player isn't.  If more pro games were played at that level of skill then I imagine the viewership and popularity would rise.  Getting players of that skill to play the game rather than something else that has more financial incentives is one of the challenge Blizzard faces as an e-sport.  

As a viewer experience their challenge is leveraging their shorter game lengths into tournaments with minimal delays and scheduling them when audiences can watch (not during work/school hours on a week day for example).  Short games with lots of action are great for short attention span viewers, but not if the delays in between games feel longer than the games are.

Spent 28 hours on a sleeper bus from Kunming-Luang Prabang. Took direct bus, all the buses that started at the Laos/China border left on time for Laos while we were stuck at customs for six hours due to improper documentation for all the junk that was being shipped on the bus. Got into Luang Prabang after curfew, no tuk-tuks, and were dropped at the China bus station which is not on the map. Eventually negotiated with the Chinese kid behind the counter at the crappy hotel attached to the bus station for an awful room for myself and the couple european girls also on the bus. Could barely sleep, got up at sunrise and relocated to a nicer spot in town.

Stayed at a guesthouse in Qui Nhon Vietnam. No one on staff spoke English, but place was pretty nice. Didn't realize I was supposed to leave key at front desk if I went out. Got back at about 11PM one night, place was closed up like Fort Knox. No doorbell, steel fence around perimeter and they couldn't hear me shouting. Finally climbed up and over the 10ft steel fence and banged on the door. Needless to say, they were very confused as to why I wasn't in my room, as they didn't have my key. I pulled it out my pocket at they were very apologetic. Finally, the oldest woman there started point at me and then the fence and motioned ""did you go over?""

I decided to walk along the perimeter through some of the old bunk houses. Little did I know that some sections of barbed wire fence dividing the yard were still up, and rather than cut across, I had to keep to the perimeter. Two girls were in the same situation, and we had like five minutes to make the bus. I took off on a run, they just shrugged their shoulders and said they'd ""figure it out."" I made it to the entrance (you know, where the train came in to the Schindler's List sorting platform) and onto the bus just as the driver was getting ready to shut the door.

Whats so fucking silly is how in our current culture there's so much intellectual inconsistency.

minority groups are always applauded for celebrating their heritage. Great, I applaud them too. But then anything that seems right wing, like patriotism or American pride, is deplored. When in fact these are really the same thing. It's a pride in your tribe/nation/heritage. 

It doesn't automatically create divisions. On the contrary, the more you try to eradicate people's national identities, the less eager they will be to participate in a global community.

 Point in case is Brexit. A smaller country with a great national heritage and distinct identity. But you allow too many people in from Eastern Europe and the middle east, and suddenly it's no longer feeling like the same country. these cultures don't always mesh. Sometimes it's like oil and water. Not saying one is superior or not. I'm just saying that national identities are important, and by trying to eradicate that sense, you will end up causing the opposite reaction.",False,1467335744,exmormon,,-2,scissor_me_timbers00,1,,t1_d4uodkm,1471071266,-2,t3_4qmzbw,,d4urwju

False,t5_2rq9c,0,"You should consider why Polish/Eastern European lancers even came about. They were part of a clear chain reaction of events.

1) First we had heavy cavalry, heavily armored, expensive and armed with a lance.

2) Heavy cavalry dominated the battlefield to such an extent, that Swiss and German pikemen eventually evolved to defeat them. 

3) The 'arms race' eventually lead to more lightly armored cavalry, wielding longer lances, to regain their previously dominant role on the battlefield. De Saxe was an early observer of the lethality of hussars.

By the 17th century though, there no longer existed the economic or cultural foundation required to support massed cavalry. Supposedly, even the knightly war horse went extinct in barely a century. This is probably why Polish hussars and similar units remained a niche presence on the Western battlefield.

Incidentally, you are perfectly describing cavalry as it was used during the English civil war.

It's also worth reflecting that it was the rediscovery of the pike, not gunpowder (as is often falsely claimed) that lead to the decline of massed cavalry on the battlefield. Cavalry even experienced a revival when field artillery developed enough to pretty much end the Swiss or Landsnechkt style pike formation. 

Cavalry was also prohibitively expensive by then, given the craftsmanship and thickness of the plate required to stop a bullet or crossbow bolt.

What I'm trying to convey is that there were many factors that eventually saw the decline of heavy cavalry on the battlefield. But it wasn't because they were secondary to infantry. It was because they were so overwhelmingly dominant, that for hundreds of years the principal goal of military innovation was focused on countering cavalry - and eventually - it succeeded in making them less than cost effective. 

The class and culture of heavy cavalry also went rapidly extinct, in pretty much the span of a couple generations, such that even when later military theorists argued for its importance, there no longer existed the resources (cultural and material) to meaningfully implement them.

If I could boil down our disagreement to a single sentence, it would be that you dramatically underestimate the reason for why cavalry had such a profound psychological effect in the first place. 

This is without getting into the whole context of how a knight on horse back, armored and swinging downwards, had a **tremendous** advantage on his opponent. That is in fact, how ancient cavalry operated, since they didn't have the stirrups to make 'shock' charges.",False,1467336618,totalwar,,1,clearsighted,0,,t1_d4urkpx,1471071504,1,t3_4qlrxj,,d4user4

'""Russian is the third language in the Islamic State after Arabic and English. Russia is one of its important suppliers of foreign fighters,"" said Ekaterina Sokiryanskaya, a senior analyst for International Crisis Group... Sharapudinov said he was handed a new passport when he arrived at the Mineralnye Vody airport in southern Russia in September 2013, where he was escorted by an FSB employee in a silver Lada car with darkened windows.

'In late 2012, Russian-speaking jihadis began to arrive in Syria. According to regional intelligence sources who have closely tracked their movements and activities, the Russian-speakers negotiated the unification of the Islamic States in Syria and in Iraq, creating the current Islamic State formation... Suddenly, the war in Syria was “confusing” to American policymakers seeking a way out of the war and an end to Assad’s regime. There were “good rebels” and “bad rebels,” and the U.S. couldn’t decide which side to support.' (http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/putin-syria-ukraine-213173)

'Regarding ISIS, Tsaplienko asked, ""Can one claim that Russia, the Russian special services are involved in the creation of ISIS?""

""Definitely, and I know that exactly, the Russian special services believed that if a terrorist organization was set up as an alternative to Al-Qaeda and it created problems for the United States as [the heavily ethnic-Russian populated region of Ukraine known as the] Donbas does for Ukraine now, it would be quite good,"" Yevgeniy said.' (http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/europe/item/22103-russian-fsb-defector-reveals-kremlin-supports-isis)

Russia did this in order to radicalize the opposition, eclipse and eliminate the moderates, and force the West into making a false choice between the regime and jihadis. Russia still systematically avoids targeting Daesh, and focuses on attacking rebels who the West supports:

'The Kremlin framed its intervention in Syria as a response to the growing threat posed by ISIS, recognizing that the terrorist group posed a joint threat to Russia and the West. This false yet  plausible narrative allowed Russia to curtail the West’s ability to unite against Russia’s efforts to bolster President Assad and project military force in the Middle East. The narrative also created  the opportunity for Russia to shed the international isolation and pariah status that followed its aggression in Ukraine despite its continued pursuit of cynical political objectives through violent  means.'

False,t5_2qh2p,0,"His solution for Islamic extremism is to stop any and all travel of Muslims into the United States. Let me simplify that for you, he wants to ban Muslims from coming into the US. Wasn't it recently that he specified those coming from ""terrorist countries"" or something of the sort? 

At which point we raise the question how he would enact something as unconstitutional as refusing entry of aliens based on their religious faith when we hold religious freedom so near and dear to our hearts, our way of life, and our legal system. The only answer I've ever seen from your camp has been something about Obama banning Iraqi's for a time, which sounds quite a lot different than banning people solely for their faith and those of said faith from multiple countries Trump has seemingly forgotten to specify as so called ""dangerous."" Then we also have to ask how we're going to make sure they aren't Muslim, are we going to institute a religion examination? Some sort of Islamic SAT to ensure they know their Quran and their Hadiths well enough to not be let into the country? Then we have to ask ourselves how banning Muslims from entering the US would have stopped the Orlando shooter who was born in Queens or terrorists coming in from Europe. 

Can you honestly sit there, so proud of who you're choosing as your candidate, without even taking note of what kind of stance that is? Banning an entire religious group isn't a solution, especially with such unclear explanations and guidelines as Trump enjoys giving. It's the same with his idea on how to pay for the wall, focusing on stopping wire transfers from Mexicans in the U.S. to their families in Mexico yet the need, as detailed on his website, to show legal documents would either extend to everyone in the U.S. or I suppose people who look Mexican.

It's empty rhetoric with clear cut bigotry. I have numerous qualms with Islam, many of them are very personal, but I don't advocate to ban all Muslims or try to nuance it with specifics that still offer no solution whatsoever.

The final decision about the future of Scotland in the European Union will be made here (and do you have the feeling that they welcome Scotland?).

The European Parliament ratifies laws, it doesn't make them. That's what happens in the European Commission and where Scotland would have the power to propose and shape - or stop - new laws and regulations. All members in the European Commission are equal in the decision-making process, regardless of the country they represent. New proposals pass a review and revision process between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament before they are ratified in the parliament. With the Lisbon Treaty the national parliaments have gained more power again. They propose new laws through the European Commission, and they ratify - or stop - laws that fall under the ""subsidiarity principle"".

The European Union cannot force Scotland to do something they don't want. It's true that Scotland as one of the smaller members in the European Union might not have a large contingent of MEPs in the European Parliament, but they won't necessarily need many MEPs. The Parliament is based on parties and coaoliton, not member states. Scotland would be part in a pan-European coalition and not speak alone with just 12 MEPs. Like I said above their representative in the European Commission with have the same weight as every other Commissioner, and sensitive decisions require an unanimous decision in the European Commission. Decisions that fall under the subsidiarity principle will be decided in the national parliaments anyway.

False,t5_33mm8,0,"&gt;Let me put it in another way. Article 50 is more about the process of making a new treaty then it is about leaving. The 2 years are there so you have time to make a new treaty. There is not some heavy clause preventing you form leaving. You don't have to pay billions, or get all countries to allow you to leave or anything like that.

No.  You are just straight up wrong in this case.  The two years are their as a buffer for both parties to get ready for the UK leaving.  The renegotiation is an option that they can choose to engage in, but that is entirely separate from article 50.  But even given all that, it's not even important!  Leaving the EU and negotiating the new treaty is effectively two parts of one event.  They are named different things, but they are just two acts of the same play.  This is what I meant when I said ""the part you don't get""

&gt;Honestly, then they are not very good deal.. And how is it possible that you have such a bad deal? Because those in favor know that getting out is close to impossible anyway so when they had the ability to sign it they did not having to care about what the people did think about it in the long run. Undemocratic is hell.

Interesting take.  Just one problem; leaving NAFTA is actually fairly simple (using your definition of simple, I would actually consider them complicated).  No part of this is undemocratic because it is entirely possible for, say Canada, to wake up tomorrow and vote to leave the NAFTA.  The difference we are having is that you think that Canada should be able to call up the US and Mexico and inform them that imports to Canada will be taxed starting in 5 days.  I say this is unreasonable and amounts to a direct economic attack on US and Mexico.  A fair person would give advanced notice and enough time for the other countries to make adjustments of their own (which is why there are out clauses).

&gt;I talked about this before. In practice I don't think it will happen a lot, just as most national laws don't get removed on a daily basis.

I've also said this before, and I think I'll just have to leave it there.  Your view of people and international relations is naive to the point of childishness.  If you think that the people of other countries aren't going to take advantage of you when they have the chance, then I pray that you never get elected into office.

&gt;Also the idea that one party benefits from it for a very short term and then exits it screwing the other is not a likely scenario.

Go look at history.  While this does not occur on a regular basis it is in not a rare event.

&gt;I never said that. I said it should be easy but it has to be fitting to the treaty.

You said that the window should be a months rather than 2 years.  I think 2 years is quite fitting for the treaty.

&gt;If there would be a direct hit on one country, if the other leaves then the out clause would indeed have something in it to lower this as much as possible. But imho in most cases it will be a lost in both directions that might level each other out.

It doesn't actually matter if both sides gets hurt.  Country A has no right to simply dictate a change in rules to country B the way you are suggesting.  To use your words, it's undemocratic for the people of country A to decide on something that will negatively effect the people of country B without their input.

&gt;In fact it is funny that you mention CETA and TTIP. Those are not even here and by everything that is known for it, a huge population is already against it. The EU on the other hand is planning on pushing it forward anyway, there has literally been talked about speeding up the process. You know why? Because they expect more parties that are against them to come to power in the coming years, so they want to push it in before they get to power.

Then you guys should vote them out and then step out of the CETA agreement.  We in Canada like the CETA agreement, and I hope that there are some out clauses built into the CETA treaties that compensates us for our losses when you guys change the rules on us.  Basically, if Europeans want to screw over our Canadian investments, I think we should be compensated for that.

&gt;This is a very specific example, but then I would still be in favor of having the ability to get out. Only the out clause has then to include a way to prevent deads. 

There are out clauses, and the out clauses are designed to prevent chaos from developing in Johannesburg.  The problem is that what you consider democratically acceptable is probably not acceptable to anyone in South Africa.

&gt;Now there is the perfect example of why I find it... no why it is so undemocratic to now be able to get out of it.

It is just as undemocratic for one party (Europe in the CETA example) to change the rules without consulting the other party (Canada).  I don't bitch and moan about it because I recognize that it is a reality of life.  All I ask is that there is fair compensation for the troubles that your party (Europe) has caused us (Canada).

At the end of all this discussion, I think I have boil my arguments down to just one central theme:  Your arguments come off as very naive and have no basis in the real world.  It all sounds great on paper, but your entire argument rests on the idea that everyone in the world will do their best to look after everyone else in the world and not try to take advantage of them.  I say that people will take advantage of others, if given the chance (just look at history for all the times this has occurred).  This is why international treaties work like other civil legal documents; clauses are put in place to deter one party from taking advantage of the other.  If your argument is that a country needs to retain its democratic right to screw over other countries, then I'll concede that.

The cause was a catastrophic wave of plague that spread across America after contact by disease-ridden Europeans -- Europeans who had no idea that their contact would be so damaging.

Europe had been nearly wiped out by these same plagues a few centuries earlier and it took *three centuries* for the European population to recover.  The Indian population collapsed, but was never able to recover because the incoming European population's vastly superior technology supported a far more robust growth rate.  So in a sense the population of *Americans* quickly recovered from this American Black Death, but the replacement population came from European stock.

But it's ridiculous to suggest that those European colonists attempted to commit genocide.  What they *attempted* was to Christianize, educate and assimilate the Indian population and turn them into Europeans, and when that didn't work they mostly herded them into areas where they could be ignored.

Since America was barely even a country at the time it had never had any quarrel with the Muslim world.

&gt; * The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that Britains shock vote to leave the European Union a week ago has created uncertainty that poses a major threat to the global economy.

&gt; * We see the uncertainty right now as probably the biggest risk to the global economy, said IMF spokesman Gerry Rice, calling on European leaders and other policymakers to take decisive actions that could lower the threat.

&gt; * British Prime Minister David Cameron, who resigned after the June 23 Brexit vote, has resisted pressure to immediately activate the Article 50 mechanism to leave the EU, saying he is leaving it to his successor, who will not be named until September 9.

&gt; * Brexit has created significant uncertainty and we believe this is likely to dampen growth in the near term, particularly in the UK but with repercussions also for Europe and for the world economy, said Mr Rice in a regularly scheduled IMF news conference.

No better opportunity exists for those who love herbology than to get a chance to work at one of England's most historic (and family run) apothecary/plant nursery owned and run by the Brocklehurst family (current head- Mandy).

* **""Belladonna and Touch-Me-Nots""**

This is a hint to it's magical (and therefore potentially dangerous) nature as *[Atropa belladonna](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/41/c9/aa/41c9aa4af459a102cacfe5e2fcd01758.jpg)* is the scientific name for what is commonly known as '[deadly nightshade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropa_belladonna#/media/File:Atropa_belladonna_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-018.jpg)' or 'witches berry'. It is in the standard potion making kits in the books, but also has a magical history in our world as in the Middle Ages belladonna was believed to be a [key ingredient](https://books.google.com/books?id=htGD3Y7WNxwC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=aconite+witches+wolves&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VjL2uk2bNP&amp;sig=qdF2RB_9ejdcPaIq5tw_ZoQTN_0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IKM0Tr_yMcjogQfymsCYDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=belladonna&amp;f=false) in [witches' flying ointment](https://books.google.com/books?id=htGD3Y7WNxwC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=aconite+witches+wolves&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VjL2uk2bNP&amp;sig=qdF2RB_9ejdcPaIq5tw_ZoQTN_0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IKM0Tr_yMcjogQfymsCYDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=aconite%20witches%20wolves&amp;f=false) (along with aconite). [Jewelweed](http://www.tradingpostinthewoods.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jewelweed-2.jpg) (also known as 'Touch-me-not') is an ingredient in some potions, but is also very useful to muggles as "" it is best known for its skin healing properties. [""The leaves and the juice from the stem of Jewelweed are used by herbalists as a treatment for poison ivy, oak and other plant induced rashes, as well as many other types of dermatitis. Jewelweed works by counter-reacting with the chemicals in other plants that cause irritation. Poultices and salves from Jewelweed are a folk remedy for bruises, burns, cuts, eczema, insect bites, sores, sprains, warts, and ringworm.""](https://altnature.com/jewelweed.htm) This also hints at a dual nature to my shop as Jewelweed (despite it's nickname) is the opposite of the lovely sounding Belladonna as it heals rather than poisons. Both are different than they appear.

* **When the family looked to form a apothecary in the UK [Ludlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow) (in Shropshire) seemed like a great option.** It is a market town and farming community. Being around other farms and nursery's is crucial to hiding the true nature of the business. It needs to blend in with it's surroundings and this is the perfect place. It's history even dates back to the Middle Ages.

* Ludlow was first founded during the [Norman Conquest of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England). **It was one of the first apothecary's ever founded in Great Britain**, however it was abandoned briefly during the [European wars of religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wars_of_religion) (the height of the witch-hunt frenzy). The family only moved back to the area slightly over 100 years later after the International Statute of Secrecy was fully implemented in 1692. Still afraid of the witch hunts, they went underground for some time and just pretended to be a weird isolated muggle family. In the 1850s, after fear of persecution was forgotten, they reopened their nursery/apothecary to both muggles and wizards and gave it it's new name *Belladonna and Touch-me-nots* (previously just being called ""That apothecary in Ludlow""). It has done nothing but grow ever since. 

* This growth is in large part due to the fact that **it grows just about everything anyone- wizard or muggle- could want**. 

Muggles are constantly amazed by how quickly the plants grow, and how hardy they are. (They need not know *Engorgio* and other charms are used to help this along.) Tropical plants who shouldn't be easy to grow in the area, thrive even during the winter months (even after the muggles take them home and plant them in their own gardens), making this a top seller to muggle gardeners and landscapers.   

As far as plants grown for magical purposes no less than: Acacia,
Aconite,
Agapanthus,
Alihotsy,
Aloe,
Angel's Trumpet,
Anjelica,
Arnica,

All these ingredients can be combined to **cure nearly every ill**, and many of the most basic cures and potions can be bought directly from the family itself. There is no better cure for the common cold or flu than the unusual teas (with mysterious ingredients) brewed by the Brocklehurst family.

* **That is why this bustling hub of plant life needs young witches and wizards to help run this predominantly family owned business.** Witches and wizards skilled in Herbology are needed to help grow and maintain this diversity of plant life, and students with a knack for dealing with magical creatures to help protect the plants and ward off any dangerous or undesirable magical creatures they may attract. And possibly most importantly, we need outstanding potion makers to help create the poultices and cures that can be made It even offers a unique opportunity for those interested in learning about muggles, as those who wish to will have the opportunity to help grow muggle plants and interact with muggles both at the store front and deliveries. 

Many of our products are shipped out to other apothecaries such as the famous *Mr. Mulpepper's Apothecary* in Diagon Alley, and others across the country, for those unable to travel to us directly by broom, apparition, or the Floo network. 

* **The store front** is a lovely (if rather humble looking) thatched roof cottage (similar to [this](http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-5/english-thatched-cottage-sarah-broadmeadow-thomas.jpg) that the muggles of the area are constantly astounded is far roomier than it looks. [Angel's trumpets](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Brugmansia_29.jpg) hang from the roof, which is a wonder to locals because they grow on [shrubs](https://www.directgardening.com/743-large_default/3-n-1-angel-trumpet.jpg) (some Muggles swear they could catch them actually make trumpet sounds as they entered the shop). The house itself is made out of brick and [Hornbeam](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hornbeam) wood (to reflect the family's dedication to the art of Herbology and Potion Making).The ground outside is littered with snowdrops making the shop look like it is blanketed in snow year round (no matter how many times they are stepped on they never seem to look worse for the wear). Finally, the front is decorated with various pink and purple belladonna flowers and occasional vibrant orange-red jewel weed. 

* The breathtaking wooden interior is covered in all kinds of exotic potted plants and trees. A giant Brugmansia shrub grows in the center of the shop and extends up to the ceiling covering the shop. These really do trumpet to alert the manager that a witch or wizard has arrived. If muggles are present they tend to chalk it up to hearing things or a hidden speaker playing a soundtrack. Behind the counter at the far end of the shop is a large bookshelf full of strange organic medicines to cure anything from acne, ague, and allergies, to chicken pox, gingivitis, and the plague. Occasionally the eagle-eyed customer can spot something far odder sitting out like a cure for [spattergroit](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Spattergroit). 

While these ""miracle"" cures are the most popular items sold to the local muggles, the foreign and exotic (yet oddly hardy) plants are their most popular muggle sales to the professional landscapers from around the country. Several [greenhouses](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Botanical_Garden_V.L._Komarov_Botanical_Institute.jpg) and tracts of land with ready (and not particularly magical) plants can be accessed through a side door.

And your definition of nationalism differs from the textbook definition. From Google:

&gt;na·tion·al·ism

&gt;ˈnaSH(ə)nəˌlizəm/

&gt;noun

&gt;patriotic feeling, principles, or efforts.

&gt;synonyms:	patriotism, patriotic sentiment, flag-waving, xenophobia, chauvinism, jingoism

&gt;""their extreme nationalism was frightening""
an extreme form of this, especially marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries.

&gt;plural noun: nationalisms

&gt;advocacy of political independence for a particular country.

So, nationalism means that you feel that your nation is superior to others, or think of your nation to the detriment of others. So, Hitler annexing Poland, Austria, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia is considered nationalism, he put the needs of the German people over the needs of everyone else. 

And does that mean that America is also jingoistic? They definitely violate the sovereignty of other nations, toppling democratically chosen leaders and installing dictators, invading nations and place their military bases anywhere, even when the locals don't want them to be there.

Granted, it does also say that nationalism is 'advocacy for the independence of a nation' so I'll give you that Ghandi  was a nationalist, but a different kind.

And also, what decides where the boundaries for nations are drawn? I ask because there are many many nations that seek independence from their current nation. Is Taiwan a different nation from China? Every nation formally agrees that Taiwan is a part of China, so are they considered a nation? What about Scotland? They are a separate country but are part of the United kingdom, should they break free from them? How about Kosovo, they have no definable borders, but are recognised by just over half of all UN members. Sealand? Nobody even lives there permanently. How about the hundreds of other micronations and autonomous regions and areas of a minority race? Are **ALL** of them nations?

But that *still* doesn't answer my question, what so great about nationalism and sovereignty? Sure, if everyone respects everybody else's sovereignty, we could have peace, but we're humans, that's not going to happen. Would it not be better to have one government in the world? Resources can be managed more frequently, costs for visiting other places would do way down, we'd have one global currency, making it even more stable than any currently existing one. Anyone could live anywhere they like, and do basically anything they want. There wouldn't be any war (unless aliens invaded), sure there would be protests and rebellions, but those are much less damaging than outright war between 2 nations.

False,t5_2zbq7,0,"&gt;Authoritarian socialism

It seems like a pretty bad term to use considering regimes that would be considered ""Authoritarian Socialist"", such as the USSR, weren't actually socialist in the first place. Although they claimed to be socialist, the means of production in these countries were controlled by bureaucrats and not the workers themselves. 

Therefore, they can be considered ""State Capitalist"" because, in function, their societies operated in much the same way as they would have if one single corporation controlled everything- in these cases, the State acted as the single corporation/capitalist. 

When you look at these authoritarian societies in this way, their actions make a whole lot more sense. For example, let's take a look at how North Korea's economy currently functions. The country outsources a lot of its workers to earn money in places such as Russia, Eastern Europe, and China. These workers send their pay back to the North Korean State, which gives a fraction of the money to the workers' families then uses the rest  to fund its ""Gift System"" where elite bureaucrats are given sports cars, fancy apartments, TVs, etc. as a reward for their loyalty. 

This behavior is much akin to what we would normally think of as a ""Capitalist""; a corporation that pays its workers less than what their labor is worth, and uses the surplus value to give large salaries and benefits to the higher-ups of the corporation.

False,t5_2qh4j,0,"After Grexit and Brexit, the next crisis to confront the European Union will be Frexit. It will prove to be the worst of all. While dramatic, the Greek tragedy had a limited run. While seismic, the British divorce will not necessarily upend Brussels. But for historical and institutional reasons, a French crisis would be cataclysmic. The midwife for the EU’s birth, France now risks becoming its gravedigger.

The ruin and rubble of World War II had not been entirely cleared when France laid the foundations for the European Union. As former Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement rightly observed last week, France is the EU’s “founding nation par excellence, the only nation capable of taking the initiative to begin Europe’s construction at the start of the 1950s.” Behind the drab language of the EU’s various treaties lay a truly heroic ideal: By ever-closer economic, monetary, and political union, the countries of Europe, led by two nations that had repeatedly been at one another’s throats in the 19th and 20th centuries, would make war and material want things of the past. As the Frenchman Jean Monnet, the guiding spirit of this new Europe, declared: “Continue, continue: There is no future for the people of Europe other than in union.”

By the same token, the French believe, rightly, there can be no Europe without the people of their own glorious nation. That corollary breathes life into France’s traditional conception of a united Europe and thus lends vitality to the continent’s abstract ideals. It also motivates Europe’s traditional bouts of frustration with France. Upon coming to power in 1958, Charles de Gaulle insisted upon the necessity of a “European Europe.” In principle, this meant a united Europe of equals; in practice, de Gaulle meant a Europe in which France would be more equal than the others. Tellingly, when he signed the Rome Treaty in 1958 (the future EU’s act of conception), it was not because he believed in “Europe.” Instead, it was because he believed in an independent and sovereign France, one yoked to the accomplishment of “great undertakings.” De Gaulle accepted the EU because it ensured France’s own magnificence.

A funny thing happened, though, on France’s way to a future of peace and prosperity. While the former grew humdrum, the latter grew hazier. After enjoying the 30-year period of postwar growth — known as the “trente glorieuses” — the French economy faltered during the oil crisis of the early 1970s and never fully recovered. While successive French governments continued to lay bricks for the European project, they failed to restart the national economy — which slowed from an annual average of 4 percent during the trente glorieuses to slightly more than 1 percent now forecast for 2017 — just as they failed to resolve the predicament of the growing number of unemployed, which currently stands at slightly more than 10 percent.

As the foundations of a new European order were being laid, France’s imperial past caught up with it as hundreds of thousands of immigrants from its former colonies in North Africa — Morocco, Tunisia, and especially Algeria — settled in the country. Recruited to fill jobs created during the trente glorieuses, these same immigrants found the welcome mat pulled from under their feet as France’s economy slowed and then headed south by the end of the 20th century. By the turn of the 21st century, the diffuse fear of “le grand replacement” — coined by the essayist Renaud Camus and positing the submersion of a white and Christian France by Arab and Muslim immigrants — had become an article of faith among the growing number of French turning to the extreme right-wing Front National (FN).

The waxing of supranational institutions, the waning of the national economy, the appearance of new immigrant communities, the disappearance of old industries and jobs: All of these are the tributaries spilling into the brackish bog called Frexit. As with Brexit, Frexit is fundamentally a crisis of national identity. The inability of both conservative and socialist governments to redress the growing social and economic fissures in French society, and to reinvent the republican model for the 21st century, has encouraged the retreat to nativism and nationalism. Tellingly, a 2015 poll revealed that if the 2005 referendum on the European Constitution were to be held again, 62 percent of respondents would vote against it, a 7 percent rise from the original “non” vote.

It is a crisis, moreover, the French government seems incapable of addressing. The day after the British vote was tallied, and the stock markets went into a tailspin, President François Hollande went before the nation and again underwhelmed it. He explained that “Europe could not go on as before,” expounded on the need to “reinforce the eurozone and democratic governance,” and exhorted Europe to take the necessary “leap” to secure its future. Stapled to the end of these oft-repeated pieties — spoken by a president with the mien of a funeral home director — was a solemn chestnut: “History,” Hollande intoned, “is knocking at our door.”

It remains unclear when or whether Hollande will open the door. Not only are 26 other nations huddled behind the same door squabbling over how to answer the knocking, but the weightiest nation seems in no great hurry to answer it at all. While Hollande was, in his inimitable style, urging his fellow leaders — in particular, German Chancellor Angela Merkel — to make haste, Merkel agreed that Europe must make haste, but slowly. Very slowly. After meeting with the leaders of Germany’s political parties, Merkel appealed for “calm and determination” and warned against “simple and fast solutions that would only further divide Europe.” In a word, whereas Hollande urged the principal duo of the EU, France and Germany, to take the lead, Merkel instead emphasized gemeinsam, or collective, action. (Over the last 48 hours, Merkel and Hollande have taken great pains to broadcast their unity. Whether this is the case in 48 days remains to be seen.)

Adding to Hollande’s woes, collective action by his own party seems as unlikely as that by the European Union. Just days before the Brexit vote, Hollande bowed to mounting pressure within the Socialist Party to hold a primary next January to choose its presidential candidate. With an approval rating only slightly better than Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu’s on the eve of his sudden removal from office in 1989 — according to a recent Le Monde poll, just 16 percent of French voters agree Hollande is a “good president” — the Socialist leader had little choice in the matter.

The tumult is greatest on the party’s left. Shortly before the Brexit vote, Arnaud Montebourg was unpersuasively denying reports that he planned to enter the primary race. Having been tapped by Hollande to serve as economy minister, Montebourg found himself unemployed in 2014 when the government, scrambling to meet the EU’s deficit requirements, largely swallowed its austerity demands. Not only has Montebourg since been a consistent critic of these policies, but his earlier anti-globalization sentiments — summarized in his 2011 manifesto Votez pour la démondialisation (Vote for De-Globalization) — are now crystallizing into a “dé-europisation” stance.

Montebourg is not the only prominent figure on the left who is, as he recently described himself, “euro-épuisé,” or “Euro-exhausted.” Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the perennial presidential candidate of the Parti de Gauche, has long inveighed against “the caste of Eurocrats and politics of austerity” imposed on EU member states. Not surprisingly, he welcomed the Brexit vote as a reality check for the French political class, as well as a promising harbinger of his own political prospects. “This is the beginning of the end to an era,” he exclaimed. “Either we change the European Union or we leave it.”

Though he hotly refuses such comparisons, Mélenchon’s reasoning and rhetoric echo that of his ideological opposite and nemesis, Marine Le Pen. Among the ways Le Pen has transformed the party founded by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, is to have turned inside out its relation to Europe. Fervently anti-Communist, anti-Gaullist, and thus pro-Europeanist during the Cold War, the FN began its long lurch toward its current hyper-nationalism with the collapse of the Soviet Union. The near-death of the Maastricht Treaty referendum in 1992, the full death of the European Constitution in the 2005 referendum, and its resurrection two years later in the widely despised Lisbon Treaty (signed by then-President Nicolas Sarkozy without a referendum) showed Le Pen père and fille the electoral advantages of mining the deepening vein of popular alienation from Brussels.",False,1467346196,europe,BURGERLAND,3,Tiger_fortress,0,UNSA,t3_4qpu9o,1471128972,3,t3_4qpu9o,,d4uxwn4
False,t5_2qh4j,0,"&gt;In the wake of the Brexit vote, Le Pen could scarcely contain her satisfaction. At a short press conference at the her party’s headquarters, Le Pen stood in front of a newly minted poster displaying a pair of hands breaking free of a handcuff made of gold stars. For those unable to interpret the image, there also ran a caption: “And Now France!” Indeed. In her opening remarks, Le Pen congratulated the British people — along with the “very brave” Boris Johnson and her “friend and ally” Janice Atkinson (a European Parliament deputy formerly with the UK Independence Party) — for reminding France that, yes, “it is possible to leave the European Union.” She also abstained from playing the religion, race, and immigration cards that brought her to prominence: The French already know the hand she is holding. As a result, she mentioned the word “immigration” just once but repeated more than a dozen times the words “liberty” and “democracy” — the very values born in Europe, she has argued, but scorned by the EU and France’s traditional political parties.

“Who would have imagined, just a few months ago, what has since become an imposing reality?” When Le Pen posed the question at her news conference, it was not mere rhetoric. Her conviction that Brexit has rendered Frexit, as well as her quest for the Élysée, all the more conceivable is no longer the stuff of fantasy.

In 2014, Le Pen was already promising that, if elected to the presidency, her first order of business would be to schedule a referendum on whether France should remain in the EU. Suddenly, this promise seems a bit less fantastic, all the more because she has largely succeeded in making the FN a party like the others. (In a recent and underreported finding by France’s prestigious polling institute, the IFOP, the historic gap between those who say they will vote for the FN and those who do vote for it has almost entirely closed. This suggests, as IFOP director Jérôme Fourquet notes, that the shame FN voters once felt is a thing of the past.) In the most recent salvo of polls from early June, in which the French were asked for their presidential preferences, Le Pen is the first over the finish line. In nearly every poll, she breaks the barrier of 30 percent, leaving her competitors in the dust.

For the moment, the nature of France’s electoral process — in which the top two finishers face off in a second round of voting — remains a rampart against a Le Pen presidency. Polls reveal that the only competitor she would defeat in the second round is the discredited and derided François Hollande. The candidacies of Alain Juppé and Sarkozy, the leading contestants for the nomination of the conservative Les Républicains, pose another obstacle. In a projected second round, both men would attract enough voters from the center and left to decisively defeat Le Pen. Finally, Le Pen’s path to the Élysée is also mined by the French public’s complex attitude toward the European Union. In an Odoxa poll taken last week, the French clearly stated that while they cannot live with the EU, they also cannot live without it. Sixty-four percent of respondents do not wish to see France quit the EU, yet at the same time only 31 percent saw the EU as a “source of hope.”

Yet, as Le Pen underscored in her press conference, much can happen in the 10 months remaining between now and France’s presidential elections. Juppé’s Europeanism and economic liberalism can easily morph into political liabilities; by the same token, voters will not forget that Sarkozy, who now insists that the Lisbon Treaty be rewritten, had rammed through that same treaty in 2007 when he was president. Most important, if the United Kingdom manages a smooth divorce from the EU, a majority of French voters may come to see a “grande France” as a source of hope, just as a majority of British voters last week saw hope in a Little England.",False,1467346209,europe,BURGERLAND,2,Tiger_fortress,0,UNSA,t1_d4uxwn4,1471128975,2,t3_4qpu9o,,d4uxwwh

You should really read the other comments on this post. These people do good in pointing out what's going on here. Brexit most certainly has immediate effects. Foreign investment will halt, and any current projects will end. Companies have a two year window to get out of a United Kingdom that is about to detach itself from a powerful European Union. Also, we should shy away from harmful speculation when discussing economics. Economic discussion is not speculative. We look at the numbers and explain the possibilities, so it would be wise to stay away from name calling and broad statements.


To support my statements, my information statements are based on readings from the following:

False,t5_2qh3l,0,"The thing is they'd have to smuggle the guns on either ships or planes, which will be much more expensive, and even more difficult.  The number of guns they personally need won't go down, so I don't see them being able to export many of the European weapons North across the border.  Currently, most of their guns that don't come from America are bought either in South America or Asia, but it's still not near ideal for them.  They'll be taking a financial hit just to maintain the amount of weapons they already use.  And game theory will prevent any individual one of them from diverting their stockpile significantly to us, because any cartel that doesn't do that will then be much better armed than them relative to the previous balance of power.

I agree that a total ban wouldn't be the way to go through.  On the other hand, there are regulations that impact criminals more than citizens.  National registries, cracking down on used gun sales, and more stringent background checks could help identify the people who actually purchase the guns that end up in organized criminals hands and prevent them from getting the guns.  If someone is buying 5 handguns a week from different sources across the state, it's pretty clear they're being used as a front who can pass current checks to get guns for people who won't, and currently there are ways for them to do it.

It's not a perfect solution, and possibly not even a good one.  It, like any suggestion on the topic, certainly wouldn't fix everything all by itself.

**Who Fears Death** by Nnedi Okorafor. I enjoyed this one immensely; it had all the trappings of generic epic fantasy but without the generic European setting. Some of the characters were annoying, but it was still a great read overall.

**Forest Mage** by Robin Hobb. Ho boy, I have so many feelings about this book. Despite feeling like I was guiltily browsing fatlogic for 700 pages, I couldn't put it down. Something about the writing just made it so darned *compelling.* But damn, Ms. Hobb, I know you like torturing your protagonists, but this was even a bit much. This is the only thing I've ever read while feeling actually guilty that I read it. I felt like an ass witnessing poor Nevarre's problems and not stepping into help.

**The Demons We See** by Krista D. Ball. This one was awesome and we all love /u/KristaDBall so I'm not sure there's more I can add to the discussion, but I really did love everything about this book.

**Renegade's Magic** by Robin Hobb. This one was a bit of a letdown after the un-putdownable-ness that was Forest Mage, but I did enjoy seeing what happened, and was glad to see [](#s ""a happy ending for Nevarre after all he's been through.""). I would have actually preferred the ending be more drawn out and some stuff in the beginning cut out. This book dragged a *lot* early on, but then the ending seemed rushed.

**Ship of Magic** by Robin Hobb. Enjoyable, though again, she's mean to her characters. In the immortal words of Eric Cartman, ""F*ck you Kyle!!""

**Mad Ship** by Robin Hobb. Disclaimer: in progress. *flails arms* omg so awesome. WAY better than Ship of Magic, and reading it around the same time as Soldier Son makes me realize why Soldier Son is poorly regarded even though I kinda liked it, because this is far and away so much better quality from the same author.

Again, why would you want to invest any kind of capital into the UK when you're not sure what their trade agreements will be with other nations. Sure, Europe isn't the only country on Earth.

One reason why people would want to set up capital in the UK is for the benefit of: 1) being in the UK 2) having access to the rest of the EU. Whatever one country gets, ***the rest offer*** in terms of trade agreements. So if you have set up a trade agreement with Germany, you can trade with every single one of the other countries in the EU as they all have the same trade rules, regulations and laws. That's the benefit of the trade bloc. 

If you make a TV in the UK, it already has all the regulations and laws to go to the rest of the EU. 

Now that they UK is ***out*** of the EU, it is now completely uncertain what those rules and regulations will be in regards to the rest of the EU. 

Therefore ***new*** capital is afraid of investing in the UK and who can blame them. It's really quite simple. Why invest in the UK when you can just go to Germany and get a better deal, especially if you were to build a factory. 

&gt; Hmm, I'm more inclined to say that Southern Europe will not enter an economic boom for the next 12 years at least so leaving the eu it isn't much of a loss.

Except for the crashing pound for starters. The longer they take on separating from the EU, the worse it's going to be. Absolutely no trade negotiations with the EU will happen until Article 50 is invoked and the UK has made good on their move from the EU. Only then will negotiations for trade even start. Which means no one is going to want to invest capital into the UK until then. Major companies have already said that.

The regulations the UK tried to get out of will likely ***still*** be imposed. They will ***not*** get complete control of their boarders because of the terms the EU puts on being able to tap into their trade bloc. The UK will ***still*** have to pay the EU a fee for being part of trade bloc too. You know what the best part about all of this is?

Now they do not have a say ***at all*** in what the EU does. Not to mention all the major players that wanted to leave the EU are now fucking backing out and running away. Boris Johnson, the poster child for the Brexit campaign? He's fucking gone lol. He's not taking control and he was so excited the day before the vote!

Mongolia and Japan. Two non-white empires out of a crapload of other European empires that did the same thing, but on a worldwide scale. How many Mongolias have come out of Europe in the past 500 years? Britain, Spain, France, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium... they may have been smaller than Mongolia (British, Spanish, and French empires just barely), but their impact was *much* wider and *much* more effective than the Mongolians could ever dream of. How many former Mongolian subjects speak Mongolian? How many former Mongolian subjects struggle with colonial mentality? How many former Mongolian subjects are living in poverty because of the effects of Mongolian colonization?

&gt; Muslims, since their inception in the 500s, have done nothing but expand, and genocide non-muslims, and are still doing it today (see ISIS).

...just like Christians? Tell me, what was one of the most common excuses for European colonization? That's right, ""we're claiming this land and civilizing these savages in the name of God!"" The only reason why Christians don't have their own ISIS nowadays is because enlightenment ideas heavily tamed them. But even then, we still have groups like the KKK: a white supremacist Christian terrorist organization who is about as big as three high schools with tens of thousands of sympathizers nationwide (and possibly thousands more outside of the US). You're able to list one genocide by Muslims out of the hundreds of genocides done by the Europeans in the Americas alone, good job. Also, out of 1.6 billion Muslims, only 100,000 at most are involved with ISIS. And let's say, a million or so Muslims are ISIS sympathizers. That's still *waaaaaaaaaaay* less than 1% of the entire Muslim population.

&gt; The ottoman empire lasted 700 years, the British, French, etc. lasted no where near that length.

Implying the Ottoman Empire is evil. Implying former Ottoman subjects struggle with colonial mentality and poverty. Implying length of an empire matters. Britain and France barely lasted half as long as the Ottomans, but they've had a *significantly* larger impact.

&gt; History shows again and again that EVERYBODY genocides, rapes, pillages and conquers, it's not a white thing, neither is slavery, neither is 'racism', neither is 'hatred and bigotry'.

False,t5_2ssp3,0,"For one thing, if you were born in 1893 instead of 1993, your early life would have been filled with much more fear of foreign threats. While many people in England worry about the effects of mass immigration into the UK today, there was much more reason to be worried about continental European geopolitics in the early 20th century. While some people denied that a great power war was possible in an age of so much economic interdependence (see Norman Angell's famous book *The Great Illusion* for an example of this thinking), other folks believed that a great big war was likely (see Bismarck's famous remark that a war would be brought about by ""Some damnfoolish thing in the Balkans."") That kind of stuff might have dominated your teenage years if you'd been politically interested at that time. 

Of course, at this age 100 years ago, you would have been in the British military fighting the Great War. Many of your best friends would have died or been seriously wounded in combat. Perhaps you would have shared their fate. If you were fortunate enough to survive, you would have had many encounters with the families of your deceased friends. It's difficult to capture the psychological impact that this would have on you as an individual, and the psychological impact that this had to the people and the nation that actually experienced this loss. 

It's quite likely that your identity would have been much more centered on religion and nationalism than what it is today. There were certainly non-religious people of all sorts in the early 20th Century, but religion played a much more pronounced role in Western European society at that point than it does today, and it was much more bound up in temporal politics. Likewise, you likely would have taken much more pride in England's global domination than someone looking back at English history would today, where we're more prone to examine the many human rights abuses and indignities which colonized peoples suffered. 

Obviously, the creature comforts you now enjoy would be radically different. No crisps, coca-cola, nor fruits in winter. Heating and air conditioning were not what they are today. And your entertainment options would have been much more limited as well. It's quite possible you could have gone for days at a time without hearing music, for example.

False,t5_2qhcv,0,"MANY Brexiteers built their campaign on optimism. Outside the European Union, Britain would be free to open up to the world. But what secured their victory was anger.

Anger stirred up a winning turnout in the depressed, down-at-heel cities of England (see article). Anger at immigration, globalisation, social liberalism and even feminism, polling shows, translated into a vote to reject the EU. As if victory were a licence to spread hatred, anger has since lashed Britain’s streets with an outburst of racist abuse.

Across Western democracies, from the America of Donald Trump to the France of Marine Le Pen, large numbers of people are enraged. If they cannot find a voice within the mainstream, they will make themselves heard from without. Unless they believe that the global order works to their benefit, Brexit risks becoming just the start of an unravelling of globalisation and the prosperity it has created.

The rest of history

Today’s crisis in liberalism—in the free-market, British sense—was born in 1989, out of the ashes of the Soviet Union. At the time the thinker Francis Fukuyama declared “the end of history”, the moment when no ideology was left to challenge democracy, markets and global co-operation as a way of organising society. It was liberalism’s greatest triumph, but it also engendered a narrow, technocratic politics obsessed by process. In the ensuing quarter-century the majority has prospered, but plenty of voters feel as if they have been left behind.

Their anger is justified. Proponents of globalisation, including this newspaper, must acknowledge that technocrats have made mistakes and ordinary people paid the price. The move to a flawed European currency, a technocratic scheme par excellence, led to stagnation and unemployment and is driving Europe apart. Elaborate financial instruments bamboozled regulators, crashed the world economy and ended up with taxpayer-funded bail-outs of banks, and later on, budget cuts.

Even when globalisation has been hugely beneficial, policymakers have not done enough to help the losers. Trade with China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and brought immense gains for Western consumers. But many factory workers who have lost their jobs have been unable to find a decently paid replacement.

Rather than spread the benefits of globalisation, politicians have focused elsewhere. The left moved on to arguments about culture—race, greenery, human rights and sexual politics. The right preached meritocratic self-advancement, but failed to win everyone the chance to partake in it. Proud industrial communities that look to family and nation suffered alienation and decay. Mendacious campaigning mirrored by partisan media amplified the sense of betrayal.

Less obviously, the intellectual underpinnings of liberalism have been neglected. When Mr Trump called for protectionism this week, urging Americans to “take back control” (see article), he was both parroting the Brexiteers and exploiting how almost no politician has been willing to make the full-throated case for trade liberalisation as a boost to prosperity rather than a cost or a concession. Liberalism depends on a belief in progress but, for many voters, progress is what happens to other people. While American GDP per person grew by 14% in 2001-15, median wages grew by only 2%. Liberals believe in the benefits of pooling sovereignty for the common good. But, as Brexit shows, when people feel they do not control their lives or share in the fruits of globalisation, they strike out. The distant, baffling, overbearing EU makes an irresistible target.

Back to the future

Now that history has stormed back with a vengeance, liberalism needs to fight its ground all over again. Part of the task is to find the language to make a principled, enlightened case and to take on people like Ms Le Pen and Mr Trump. The flow of goods, ideas, capital and people is essential for prosperity. The power of a hectoring, bullying, discriminatory state is a threat to human happiness. The virtues of tolerance and compromise are conditions for people to realise their full potential.

Just as important is the need for policies to ensure the diffusion of prosperity. The argument for helping those mired in deprivation is strong. But a culture of compensation turns angry people into resentful objects of state charity. Hence, liberals also need to restore social mobility and ensure that economic growth translates into rising wages. That means a relentless focus on dismantling privilege by battling special interests, exposing incumbent companies to competition and breaking down restrictive practices. Most of all, the West needs an education system that works for everyone, of whatever social background and whatever age.

The fight for liberalism is at its most fraught with immigration. Given that most governments manage who comes to work and live in their country, the EU’s total freedom of movement is an anomaly. Just as global trade rules allow countries to counter surges of goods, so there is a case for rules to cope with surges in people. But it would be illiberal and self-defeating to give in to the idea that immigration is merely something to tolerate. Sooner than curb numbers, governments should first invest in schools, hospitals and housing. In Britain new migrants from the EU contribute more to the exchequer than they take out. Without them, industries such as care homes and the building trade would be short of labour. Without their ideas and their energy, Britain would be much the poorer.

Liberalism has been challenged before. At the end of the 19th century, liberals embraced a broader role for the state, realising that political and economic freedoms are diminished if basic human needs are unmet. In the 1970s liberals concluded that the embrace of the state had become smothering and oppressive. That rekindled an interest in markets.

When Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, amid the triumph of Soviet collapse, an aide slipped Mr Fukuyama’s essay on history into her papers. The next morning she declared herself unimpressed. Never take history for granted, she said. Never let up. For liberals today that must be the rallying cry.",False,1467354837,ukpolitics,,1,stormforce7916,0,,t3_4qqcg2,1471130827,1,t3_4qqcg2,,d4v1udw

It's like the nukes argument. Russia didn't nuke America because they thought America would launch a similar attack against them. In the end there was no war and the best possible outcome came about. The question is if Russia launched nukes anyway, should America respond with bombing Russia. Obviously different opinions on that, but i hope people would at least recognize the aggressor.

Then in expanding her world, she wanted to incorporate real-life elements and give credit to their Native roots, but she wasn't nearly informed enough to do it sensitively.  (I think the quality of this story backs up that assertion - as you said, I was underwhelmed by the writing, and that suggests it was done very hastily.)  So she wanted to throw together a literary equivalent of a Abercrombie and Fitch model in a feather headdress, which is especially cringeworthy considering that Native Americans are almost wiped out (compared to their original populations), and their cultures are often distorted and conflated, when they're represented at all. So I very much understand the sentiment behind much of the backlash.

All those saving have been passed on to the purchasers to promote Harm Reduction. We also give away free reagents randomly to promote Harm Reduction and give detailed advice whenever we can - see our testimonials page for customer feedback.
We use high grade plastic bottles(HDPE) primarily as we tried using glass (oil/scent type) bottles but found the dropper mechanism was extremely poor especially the more you use. We tried to modify but went for the HDPE bottles as they allowed for a consistent dropper action throughout use.
Basically the small glass type bottles cause you to get frustrated (can take minutes to dispense a droplet) and hence you shake the bottle etc, which is not good with concentrated acids flying randomly around burning clothes, skin, eyes etc (We include protective gloves in all our kits).

March 1990: MU Press' first original anthropomorphic title is Dwight R. Decker's and Teri S. Wood's Rhudiprrt, Prince of Fur issue one. (Current, with Will Faust replacing Wood as the artist.)

Spring 1990: Mythagoras, an excellent literary furry fanzine, is published by Bill Biersdorf and Watts Martin in Tampa (to issue three, Autumn 1990).

September 1990: The Furry Home at Squirrel Hill (2613 Tilbury Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) is started as a furry commune by Centaur (Paul Blair), Ashtoreth (William Haas), Drew Maxwell, and Shaterri (Steve Stadnicki). All are students at or work at Carnegie-Mellon University, and all had been role-playing furry characters on a general SF multi-user dimension, Islandia, until it shut down that summer. The Home lasts as a furry commune through several student generations until around 1994, when the last furry fans are replaced by non-fannish students.

November 1990: FurryMUCK is built as the first exclusively Furry MU* by the denizens of the Furry Home at Squirrel Hill plus Claire Benedikt, with Drew Maxwell as the prime wizard, to replace the defunct Islandia. By 1996 it has more than two thousand users worldwide, with two hundred to three hundred log-ons per evening. The core group shifts around late 1992-early 1993 from Pittsburgh to the Bay Area, as the wizards graduate from Carnegie-Mellon and settle into the Silicon Valley computer industry.

December 1990: Gary Sutton in Poulsbo, a suburb of Seattle, starts the Furry Press Network as furry fandom's second major APA. Despite a successful start, Sutton kills it in early 1992 by refusing to allow its other members to continue it after he gives it up.

January 1991: ConFurence 2, on 25-27 January at the Holiday Inn, Anaheim, California, grows to an attendance of more than two hundred. Guests of Honor are Reed Waller, Kate Worley, Steve Gallacci, and Vicky Wyman. It is the first to have attendees from mundane companies (Carl Gafford and Len Wein of Disney Comics). The art show auction brings in over $3,000.

March 1991: The Tai-Pan Project, featuring stories set on a furry-crewed tramp spaceship, is started as a shared-world writers' project edited by a group of Seattle fans chaired by Whitney Ware (current, under new editorship and title, Tales of the Tai-Pan Universe).

June 1991: Mark Merlino and the ConFurence group publish a fanzine, Touch (to issue three, August 1992).

July 1991: The Furkindred: A Shared World is started by Charles Melville and Edd Vick at MU Press as a writers' and artists' project. Stories adhere to guidelines describing a furry world, its nations and politics (current).

November 1991: Antarctic Press begins Furrlough, a monthly anthology comic book for furry action-adventure stories (current).

February 1992: The ""First British Furry Micro-Con"" is held 1-2 February, when Ian Curtis invites furry fans throughout Britain (only about a dozen) to meet a group of visiting American fans. A dozen fans (six American and six English) spend the weekend partying at Curtis' home in the village of Yateley, Surrey, England.

February 1992: Dwight J. Dutton in Huntington Beach, California turns Huzzah! (previously an Albedo fanzine) into an invitational furry artists' APA starting with its issue four (current).

May 1992: Shanda the Panda, created and written by Mike Curtis in Beaumont, Texas (later Conway, Arkansas), debuts from MU Press. By the end of 1996, Shanda holds a record for the number of publishers (MU, Antarctic, Vision Comics, and Curtis' own Shanda Fantasy Arts) and artists who have produced her adventures.

July 1992: Growl (Paul Groulx) in Frankford, Ontario starts the FURthest North Crew as an APA for primarily Canadian furry fans. It is almost immediately filled by former Furry Press Network members, and becomes furry fandom's third strong APA (current, under new editorship).

August 1992: Mortality comes to furry fandom when popular fan artist Charles ""Deal"" Whitley of New Haven, Connecticut succumbs after a lifelong struggle against sickle-cell anemia, on 30 August.

June 1993: Jan Paxton invites furry fans around Britain to a weekend party at his parents' home in Tonyrefail, South Wales, 5-7 June. About ten fans attend.

June 1993: Antarctic Press starts Genus as an anthology comic book for furry mature erotic humor (current).

September 1993: Darrell Benvenuto in New York starts The American Journal of Anthropomorphics, an annual coffee-table-format collection of furry art (to issue four, 1997).

October 1993: Damien Cugley in Oxford publishes the first British furry fanzine, Furry Furry issue one, autumn/ winter 1993. (To issue two, spring/summer [May] 1994.)

December 1993: Anthropomorphine, the first successful British furry fanzine, is published by Kevin Charlesworth of Hailsham, East Sussex (current).

January 1994: After ""rattling around"" with attendances in the low hundreds at different hotels, ConFurence V almost fills the Airporter Garden Hotel in Irvine, California, 21-23 January, with an attendance of slightly more than six hundred. The Airporter, with its friendly management, becomes the first real ""home"" for ConFurence. A Rowrbrazzle tenth anniversary celebration is held.

April 1994: Ian Curtis hosts another weekend furry party at his home in Yateley, 22-24 April. This is called Furry Housecon 3, retroactively assigning #1 and #2 to his February 1992 party and Jan Paxton's June 1993 party. Furry Housecons have been hosted by Curtis in Yateley approximately quarterly since then (#13, 29 November-1 December 1996; attendance sixteen UK fans and two German fans). The average attendance is around fifteen.

July 1994: The first annual UK Fur CON is held 9-11 July, organized through FurryMUCK by Adam Moss as an informal house party at his home in Colchester, Essex. About fifteen fans attend, including one each from Germany and the U.S. Furry Housecon 4 is the same weekend (8-10 July), and accusations of ""trying to hijack our con"" against the Housecon are later put down to an innocent lack of communication between Britain's FurryMUCK and non-Internet furry fans. The two series of house parties are mutually coordinated today.

November 1994: Martin Dudman in Keston, a suburb of London, launches the first major British furry fanzine, the quarterly Fur Scene: The Anthropomorphic Newsletter (current). Dudman also starts United Publications, a mail-order service to import American furry books, comics, and fanzines for British fans, and vice versa.

November 1994: As a result of perceived anti-furry prejudice at the annual Philcon SF convention in Philadelphia, east coast furry fans hold their own Furtasticon I. (Some furry fans are declined space in Philcon's art show or dealers' room when their applications arrive after both are all booked up.) Furtasticon is organized by Trish Ny of Cleveland at the Holiday Inn City Line in Philadelphia, 18-20 November. Organized on a couple of months' notice, it draws about 230 fans from across North America and creates a demand for an annual furry convention for eastern North America.

January 1995: An Anthropomorphic Bibliography, by Fred Patten in Los Angeles, is published by Yarf! as the first bibliographic compilation of general literature and SF genré novels featuring anthropomorphized animals. Its unexpected popularity leads to an expanded second edition in August 1996.

May 1995: UK Fur CON 2 is held 26-30 May, organized by Ian Stradling at his home in Bristol. About twenty show up to his house party, including a fan from Germany. Videos shown include the British premiere of Eric Schwartz's furry animation.

June 1995: EuroFurence 1 is held 30 June-3 July; organized over the Internet by Gerritt Heitsch and Tobias Köhler as a house party at Heitsch's parents' vacation farm in Kaiser Wilhelm Koog (near Hamburg), Germany. Nineteen attend from Northern Europe and Britain. Activities include watching furry videos and drawing in each others' sketchbooks.

July 1995: South Fur Lands is started by Jason Gaffney in Brisbane as the first major Australasian furry fanzine (current).

September 1995: Ian Curtis hosts a ""British Furry Convention"" (Furry Housecon 8) at his home in Yateley 1-4 September, so British fans can meet American fans visiting England after the 1995 World Science Fiction Convention in Glasgow the previous week.

&gt;* 'Brexit was likely to cause a dampening of growth in the near term, and urged policy makers to act decisively while dealing with the situation'..

&gt;* Britains decision to leave the European Union has created significant uncertainty that will have repercussions not only for the UK and Europe, but also for the global economy, the International Monetary Fund has warned.

&gt;* IMF spokesperson Gerry Rice said the Brexit was likely to cause a dampening of growth in the near term, and urged policy makers to act decisively while dealing with the situation.

&gt;* Brexit has created significant uncertainty, and we believe this is likely to dampen growth in the near term, particularly in the UK, but with repercussions also for Europe and the global economy, he said on Thursday.

&gt;* Rice said the IMF sees the near-term risk for the UK, the EU and the global economy arising mainly from macroeconomic and financial market impact, and a sizable increase in uncertainty, including on the political front.

False,t5_2qimj,0,"So you think you should put bulletproof windows on your car? I mean you don't exist in a vacuum.



Do you really not see how you make no sense at all? 



Let's look at the big picture. Such a huge change to the DNA of the sport should have some very very good arguments and **factual** evidence to support it would make a difference. But no - if a spring gets loose next year it can still hurt a driver. If one of the cars hits a 3 tonne tractor with 200kph it would still have fatal consequences and there is **no data** to show otherwise. Plus - fantastic precautions to make sure this never happens again are already taken. 


You might say - what about Micheal or Alonso earlier having near misses with their heads? But then why is this change pushed so hard now and not when those accidents happened? Ever thought about that? I will tell you - it's cause now the Bianchies are now sueing the FIA and the FIA want to make absolutely sure they don't lose. Why? Cause it will set a very dangerous precedent and above all it will lose them **a shitton* of money. Not just what they may have to potentially pay to the Bianchies, but also cause it will make relationships with sponsors (like Heiniken) much much more difficult to maintain. For reference, see the open letter to Jean Todt from the European Alcohol Policiy Alliance. It would, long-term- give a lot of power to similar organisations over the FIA to pressure them out of sponsorship deals. As always, it is all about money.


So for the same reason you shouldn't put bulletproof windows on your car, the halo shouldn't be implemented - the cost-benefit analysis just doesn't add up. Costs are not only monetary in this case, but also intrisic ones like the appeal and so called DNA of the sport, which can have very negative long-term impact. But the FIA doesn't care, as long as they make sure not to lose hundreds and hundreds of millions in the short to medium-term.


And lastly, the sport is dangerous and that's ok. You don't see stupid ideas like that in motogp, and drivers get injured or die **a lot** more often there. Or are motogp drivers' lives worth less? Nope, once again - it's all about money. If you don't like the danger of the sport - go watch tennis, but please, don't be vocal to change it for the many of us who love that part. The drivers as well know better than anyone the danger of it, and they still climb in the cockpit with a passion. If someone doesn't see fit, they are absolutely free to go.

If you want to use the real Norse culture ('viking' was a 'profession' rather than a people; a bit like someone calling our society the 'Developers' because some people write computer software and the archaeologist found their code) then you're competing with historical fiction writers, who now have to do loads of research to make their books reflect what we know about the historical periods in question. A version of Norse society without the research is going to feel unsatisfying for people used to well-researched historical fiction. Your audience is going to include people who get disappointed at inaccuracies; you'll be selling to people who read Bernard Cornwell or Colin Iggulden and so you better be as painstakingly 'period' as they are (even though I'm sure they take artistic license with some aspects of their work, they damn well know their stuff).

If you want to do the 'cartoon' version, then I'd go with a secondary world where you write an analogous society.

Emphasized the key word there. The Commission is elected to represent the EU as a whole, and anything relating to the status of a EU member is managed through it, not around it - any other mode of operation undermines the commission and weakens its negotiating position.

That's a shite defeatist mentality and one I don't subscribe to. We can at least look to improve the football on show and maintain results. 

I like Robbie and defended him a lot last season. I wasn't reactionary after the Hibs collapse like some others. And yes third place is an achievement first season back but you have to be balanced and appreciate that another decent manager, with the same resources would probably have done the same. Robbie is increasingly stubborn to a point, and when things aren't going well in a game - when we fall behind or are under the cosh with a 1 goal lead - he doesn't make changes that seem to affect games. This is both his failure to motivate players on the pitch to do better and failure to utilise his bench early in games when they can still be influenced. If you saw the fitness of the players around 75 minutes last night, there was no excuse for not using the third sub. And of course the constant disciplinary problem that have plagued us without him cutting it out -  silly yellows for arguing with referees, pathetic fouls etc. Poor man management. 

Of course I'm happy to see him get longer in the job. I won't be calling for his head if we exit Europe next week. Though he really will have to ramp up his ideas and have a good start to the season or I feel we're all going to sway against him very quickly.

All he has to do is play up to the media, win a general election and THEN he can move forward with his policy ideas, but he's held back by his own 'snobbery' about maintaining his ideals.

Also while the media has had a role in the whole discussion, blaming immigrants for a thing or two ain't all that untrue. The fact is that in all EU countries that provide a surplus to the EU have had issues with immigration. For the simple reason that they don't do anything to limit the amount of people coming from within and outside EU borders. Various workers from Poland are taking jobs from people that are then going to rely on government payouts. And since the Polish are then not paying as much tax as they do it for less, you cut the income and increase the amount you need to spend. As a nation you cannot do anything about that because the EU forced countries to implement certain laws and to sign certain laws to never get around this. It sounded fine as a law in the 80's but now seems terrible. 

And what your government did is not much different from what my government did, but that doesn't mean that the EU has simply nothing to blame. If they got their act together, my government wouldn't have had to cut anything. But its also about the government not supporting all of its citizens that made it this way and (especially in your winner-takes-all system you have) there isn't really something you can do about it. There's a big gap between politicians and the people they represent. And the gap is bigger in the EU.

Now about the 350 million a week, technically one leave-campaign didn't say it exactly. They only said that instead of paying the EU 350 million, we should finance NHS. Not finance NHS with 350 million. And like many others claim that everything leave claimed has been denied or twisted after the vote is simply false. Multiple leave-campaigns and different statements get switched around making people believe that they are taking it back.
And if you would use the same amount of effort for discrediting the leave-camp to the remain-camp you will see that neither side played it nice and things can be said about either. Like the black-Friday they predicted and the immediate financial meltdown hasn't happend yet. Many models they used for predicting how it will end are already wrong. And how about you ignoring the way the EU now wants to circumvent national parliaments for the CETA treaty to prevent the Dutch and others to have any say or referendum about it.

If I had to live in Germany though, Berlin would be the place to go.

Think of how your grandparents or great grandparents would have thought, that's how most of Germany feels. When I came to Potsdam, which is only 20 km from multicultural Berlin, it was like stepping in to the twilight zone. It was a city of white people. I never experienced such a thing before...sure I have been to very white towns/villages in Canada, but this was a CITY. When I went to a village here in Germany, people and especially children looked at me in awe as me and a friend spoke English. Germans are still very much a local people. Even super local Canadian towns are well connected to the outside world and grow up with a more wordly understanding... this is far from the case in Germany when many of the towns here don't even have cable internet or a phone signal that could support much. It utterly shocked me that this small densely populated country doesn't have 100% coverage.

I know a number of Arabic and Turkish here who essentially grew up or were born here, speak German perfectly, and are very well educated, yet still feel like an outsider. I have even witnessed racism against one of these individuals personally and it was disgusting. It's a horribly toxic thing and I would never want my child to ever grow up thinking such a world was possible. Coming to Germany and learning how Germans and other Europeans think really drives home the precious thing Canada has... it's so unbelievably unique we don't even realize it growing up. When it comes to social issues, we have it right. There are many amazing things Europe and especially Germany has to offer, but Canada is at least 2 generations ahead of Germany when it comes to these types of social issues. I mean come on... it was only 70 years ago that they wiped out every single minority in their country in a brutal and barbaric fashion. Of course people here have trouble accepting Turks or Arabs as Germans... what would you expect? It's not the fault of Germans today for this... they simply have not grown up around minorities so they still seem foreign.

Sorry for the long rant, but when you're here in the thick of it you learn many things. Berlin is a bit of a gem in Germany, many of these things do not apply to Berlin.

Corbyn met him in 2012. He had already been convicted of funding Hamas. He had already said in 2007:

&gt; We [Muslims] have never allowed ourselves to knead [the dough for] the bread that breaks the fast in the holy month of Ramadan with children's blood. Whoever wants a more thorough explanation, let him ask what used to happen to some children in Europe, whose blood was mixed in with the dough of the [Jewish] holy bread

You can't call this ""colorful"" or related to ""Gaza and Palestine"". He had already made straight-up anti-Semitic statements and 9/11 conspiracy theories quite public, and he met and was praised by Corbyn *after* all that. And *after* he funded a genocidal terrorist group.

[Open Letter to FT](http://www.economistsforbrexit.co.uk/open-letter-to-ft)

Summary of views:

- Brexit will result in a better economic outcome than remaining in the EU.

- Economic forecasts (based on proven financial modelling by Patrick Minford) show that on leaving the EU:

- Output grows 2%

- Competitiveness rises 5%

- Real disposable wages up 1.5%

- Exchange rate falls 6%

- Inflation and interest rates rise to 2-3% range

- Current account improves to -1.5% of GDP

- Unemployment reduced by 0.2% (75,000 on benefit count)

The UK does not need to do a trade deal to trade. It already trades extensively with many countries across the globe under the rules of the WTO and can continue to do so with EU countries in the future (in the same way that the US, Japan and China does). Leaving the EU will decrease prices and boost GDP.

**The City of London will retain its role as the world’s leading financial centre outside of the EU.**

The UK is a net contributor to the EU budget and those funds could be utilised far more efficiently elsewhere.

Now we knew that job losses would occur. However if you talk to the Leave campaigners they think we can revitalise our blue collar industry.

False,t5_2y44v,0,"&gt; ""Boys will be boys"" is used very often to excuse men harassing women

I think it's more a generic excuse for men behaving in a more violent, risk-taking, 'immature' way and IMO, both genders are told that they have to expect and deal with it when men act this way.

My objection is not that it isn't used to justify some kinds of harassment of women, but rather, I object to the narrative that society wants women to exclusively or primarily suffer from this. In reality, I believe that women get partially protected from this, because women get 'special cased' in some situations. Of course, heterosexuality means that it's primarily women who experience transgressive sexual behavior by men, but that is not due to socialization, but due to biology. If you don't look at biology, but exclusive protection for one gender, then that is afforded to women.

When I was a kid, I was told to fight back against bullies. No one would protect me. Yet if a girl was bullied by a boy, she could just complain and get him punished. That is what I'm talking about. The narrative is used to shape men and women get some protection from it by getting special treatment, while men don't, because they must be turned into hyperagents who 'fight their own battles'.

&gt; As for your explanation of gender roles - you yourself seem to fail to empathise with female gender roles too. You point out how men are restricted by their gender roles, being expected to provide, but you don't seem to acknowledge how women have their own gendered expectations to fulfill 

The topic of this thread was what boys were taught, so I don't think it's fair to complain that I'm not giving equal attention to what girls are taught.

&gt; beside those expectations, the actual biological constraints that they're face but men are free from

I was talking about how people of one gender will take up the slack that the other gender leaves (and feel forced to do so).

It doesn't actually matter whether that slack is due to biological or social reasons (in practice, both, I would say).

&gt; Various statistics across European countries also show women with children working fewer hours. ""Work-life balance"" is an issue that women are generally much more affected by than men.

Perhaps. In my EU country, the standard is a 1.5 worker household, with the woman working half a job. A recent study showed that men and women had very comparable amounts of work (job + housework) and free time, except for one group: men with young children.

In most other EU countries, women seem to either work full time or not work at all, which of course makes it hard for women who work and do most of the domestic work. [These statistics](http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/gender/publications/Multi-Country/EUROSTAT/HowEuropeansSpendTheirTime.pdf) show that men tend to have about 1/2 an hour more free time one average, although some of that is 'bought' by sleeping less (which ought to be a negative for men's well-being).

Interestingly, [these American statistics](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/03/14/chapter-6-time-in-work-and-leisure-patterns-by-gender-and-family-structure/), where you have a similar pattern, show that: ""Surprisingly, no gender differences are found about how men and women evaluate their free time, nor did fathers and mothers differ in their views. More than six-in-ten adults say that generally they feel like they have enough free time to do the things they want to do."" So women don't seem to feel that they are overworked more than men.

As anything to do with gender, the question is whether women actually have bigger issues, or whether it's simply the narrative that they do. Perhaps the truth is that women have more extremes in this case: you have more women with a very good work-life balance (primarily among housewives) and more women with a very poor work-life balance (primarily among working women who don't have nannies, cleaning ladies, etc); while men are more middle of the road. Feminists tend to self-select to be working women, for obvious reasons, so it's not surprising that their narrative would focus on one group of women and mostly ignore the other group.

&gt; Now that they're expected to also have a job on top, there are some sacrifices they have to make as well, whereas for men things haven't changed as much.

I disagree. Men with children that I work with are definitely focusing more on child care than past generations. Quite a few are working 36 hours, rather than 40 and they often make work choices that allow them to drop their kids off or pick them up at day care. Men wouldn't make those choices in the 50's.

&gt; Meanwhile, if you're a woman, you might have it hard in both cases - not so much because of discrimination but simply because you can't be in 2 places at the same time.

I don't see that disparity. IMHO, the easiest life you can have nowadays is full time housewife/husband. The second easiest is being a casual worker with no family obligations. All other choices can be extremely demanding or less so, it greatly depends on the specific circumstances. Balancing a non-'fast track to the top' job with child care can be easier or harder than really focusing on a job. An example of the latter are 60+ hour rat race jobs or badly paying professions that force people into long and irregular hours to earn a decent living (like police work, road works, etc).

&gt;  If a woman wants to be a housewife... well, good luck finding a man who's rich enough to support a whole family with comfortable lifestyle and also willing to do that. I think a lot of people overestimate how many men are willing to go through that.

The required income for a socially acceptable lifestyle has been going up far faster than the wages. So it's simply an option for fewer and fewer men, as they can't bring in enough money.

Add in that fewer men want to live to work/provide and it's become an option that more women want than that there are men who can/want to do it.

&gt; And if you want to be a working mother, like most women nowadays in the West - this is where the real challenge begins.

Nous voila face à un cas classique de problème d'estime de soi.     

Je le sais je l'ai vécu.     

Et oui, les idées noires, les poubelles qu'on sort pas.... et autres joyeusetés.        


""Je ne plairais jamais à une femme""        

"" Je ne suis pas assez XXX ou assez YYYY ""         


Ces préjugés qu'on a sur nous, il faut :     

 1 - Prendre conscience qu'on a des idées reçues sur nous, et prendre de la distance avec ; par exemple, une fille attouchée petite par son oncle qui lui disait ""personne te croira car tu es une petite menteuse"" n'a rien dit et a grandi pour devenir une fille persuadée qu'elle ne valait rien. POurtant, vu de l'extérieur, on voit bien que c'est pas de sa faute. Oui mais voila, elle dans sa tete c'est pas pareil elle est persuadée qu'elle vaut rien. Toi, c'est pareil, y a surement une part de verité qui explique tes sentiments négatifs sur toi, mais à au moins 70% ils sont complètement exagérés... et si tu en discutes avec quelqu'un tu verras qu'ils le sont... et que y a pas de drame... et que tout va bien.        


2 - Il faut passer à l'action : ce sont tes experiences futures qui vont te faire te rendre compte qu'en fait, hey, les choses peuvent bien se passer, et ho, tes préjugés sur toi ""je suis moche, je suis pas sympa... etc"" sont des préjugés, car SPOILER ALERT d'autres petits et tout un tas de gens ont eu une vie amoureuse satisfaisante et épanouie sans avoir la gueule de brad pitt ou d'angelina jolie. Du coup passe à l'action, tente des trucs, et à chaque banane observe le pourquoi du comment et retente. J'étais la pire des quiches avec les filles, aujourd'hui elles me courrent après (ça ne fait pas de moi un homme heureux mais ça aide)        


3 - Culpabilité. Ce mot ne sert à rien, bannis le, arrpete de t'en vouloir, tu vis, tu rendras des comptes à Dieu si tu le rencontres à la fin.      


4 - Le sens de ta vie. Tu as 87 ans, tu es le soir de ta mort. Ca y est. De quoi auras-tu été fier ? Que veux tu accomplir dans ta vie? Quelles sont tes valeurs? Certains veulent enseigner. D'autres veulent donner. Certains veulent un job de manager. D'autres veulent être indépendants. Ce qui est important c'est de déterminer avec les deux trois grandes valeurs qui te définissent en tant que personne. T'as le droit de répondre ce que tu veux à cette question, mais l'important c'est de déterminer dans la vie en fonction de ça. ""Je pars en Espagne car j'aime profiter du soleil et des vacances"". ""Je me lève pour travailler car je veux nourrir ma femme et mes enfants"". ""Je monte une start up car je cherche le succès et la reconnaissance"". "" J'ouvre un bouquin ce soir car je souhaite me cultiver et j'aodre apprendre et partager"" etc etc...       

5 - Après, un peu de r/redpill ne peut pas te faire de mal. Du r/nofap non plus. Mais c est toi qui vois (moi jy arrive pas). En gros : prends toi en main, n'attends pas le miracle, il viendra pas, sport, hygiene, réussite, pouvoir, sommet du monde et de la vie. Ou tout simplement bibliothecaire à Meudon, mais ce qui compte c'est que tu l'aies choisi, pas que tu l'aies subi.      




Je souris en lisant ton post, ça aurait pu être le mien. Ca va aller. Je sais que ty crois pas, mais je sais que ça va aller. Tu as tout ce qu'il faut. Y a des tas de gens qui ne se rendent même pas compte de tout ça et qui meurent tranquillement en 30 ans dans une vie qu'ils ont pas choisi, un job pas choisi, une relation pas choisie etc. Le fait que tu exprimes tout ça c'est déjà la preuve que t'as une frustration, ce qui est la preuve qu'en fait, t'as des envies ! Il ne tient désormais qu'à toi de remonter et tu verras que ce ""down"" t'auras par la suite amené plus haut que tout le monde. C'est ton destin, poteau (ou meuf, d'ailleurs).

There are certain industries that I hear about that certainly are affected, most-obviously small French farms.  Given other articles I've seen about protests, destruction of agricultural goods being shipped past French borders, and so forth, I [assume that the process of having small farms go out of business is underway in France as well](http://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-economy-agriculture-secret-anguish-of-the-french-farmer/):

So I can understand that upset (though I also predict it, and I'd call it a move that will make society better-off).  But outside those areas?

 1. Being realistic, we live under Capitalism and a breakdown or limitation (if it happens) of the free flow of capital between Britain and the EU will hurt everyone in Britain; I'm no economist but it shouldn't be controversial to also say that banks moving to the Continent will negatively affect the working class of the UK in many and subtle ways.

No, the argument is also one of self-reliance and consequence for your actions. Unskilled workers could and indeed many still can educate themselves to semi-skilled or skilled professions, but their choices mean they have to compete against immigrants.

If anything workers in this country who toil their way up to skilled status are particularly lucky; even skilled Eastern Europeans have to learn a second language and move away from their country to put their skills to use.

British workers already know the world's language and usually have a city nearby (London, Bristol, Oxford, Cambridge, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow) to ply their trade.

At my old consulting job language was the limiting factor.

From what I've seen of Trump, isn't he one such danger? Sarah Palin scared the life out of me with her...very poor reasoning.

I would argue against that. Your patriotism has led to one or two incidents already, such as the internment of Japanese Americans.

America simply hasn't been around long enough, and perhaps not learnt many lessons from its parent continent, over the dangers of teaching your kids that you are the greatest nation on the planet.

Every country that has ever made that claim has done so with evidence to back it up. The British had the natural superiority of the British Man through his thought and education. Germany made that claim due to their genetic purity. It really depends upon the ideals of the time.

I would argue that America, being the size it is, has little need for expansion. Well, I think the native Americans might have something to say for you taking over that country. I also think the Iraqi people have something to say for what both my and your country did to them (we have an inquiry report coming out soon that may charge our PM at the time with war crimes, and I'm pretty sure it'll reference the American intelligence community as well)

False,t5_2qh03,0,"Haha, sure. 

I guess to start with there'd been some growing racial tension in the UK for the last 10+ years due to immigration, just like in the US. The UK Independence Party started getting more support based on its opposition to immigration and the EU (which they blamed the immigration on) just like Trump is. Although UKIP would never win, their growing support and the fact they were leeching votes from the much bigger Conservative and Labour parties was a concern. So back in 2013 the Prime Minister David Cameron, when running for re-election, promised to hold a public Leave/Remain vote if we voted for him. He won, and so he was obligated to keep that promise and a referendum was planned for 23rd of June. 

Various politicians and celebrities of all sorts of backgrounds declared their support for either Leave or Remain. Remain had the backing of most major politicians and financial experts etc, but Leave had some very loud and animated individuals who tapped into the public's frustration with modern politics and the feeling of isolation from government. Against all expectations, Leave won the vote. Analysis of the votes showed that mostly older and less wealthy voters chose to Leave, while younger and more affluent voters chose Remain. 

Following the vote, David Cameron (who had backed Remain all along) felt he had to resign as he'd spectacularly failed in this whole 'vote for me, and I'll let you vote on the EU, but I hope you vote Remain like I want you to' plan of his. Crucially, he resigned **before** signing the documents you need to actually leave the EU. He basically quit and said ""whoever takes over can be the one to actually deal with the paperwork"". This has caused a total and utter stalemate, as nobody wants to be the person who takes over and starts that process! Boris Johnson, one of the primary campaigners for Leave and the previous favourite to take over from David Cameron announced yesterday that he doesn't want the job anymore and won't be running for election after all. Several other key Conservative politicians have done the same. There are growing calls to hold an entirely new General Election (which isn't currently scheduled until 2020, so would have to be brought forward significantly) just to sort this weird power vaccuum out and we're currently not sure what will happen. 

I guess the US equivalent (assuming you're american) would be if Trump promised that, if elected, he'd hold a public referendum on whether to split America into North and South or East and West halves or something, and the public voted him in, so he held that referendum, and the public against all expectations agreed to it, and then shocked at what he'd actually just done Trump suddenly resigned without doing it and left other people to take over and work out whether they go through with it or not.

&gt; The ramshackle house, which has survived a century of wear and tear and a devastating earthquake in 1934, retains little of its old architectural charm. The large battered wood panels jutting from the tiled roof, a small family well and a house number etched on the wall are the few mark the crumbling edifice.     

&gt; Orwell, né Eric Blair, was the second child of Ida and Richard Walmesley Blair, who worked as sub-deputy agent in the Opium Department of the Indian Civil Service. A massive opium warehouse faces the house, where Orwell spent just one year. Two photographs exist: one of him in his mother’s arms [and another in his ayah’s](http://i.imgur.com/l9UBF57.jpg).  Besides that nothing is known about the family’s life in the district that borders Nepal. “Of all the biographies and articles written about my father, little has been said in relation to his birthplace. This is simply because he left at the age of one. Nevertheless Motihari is a significant part of his story; everything written about him starts at Motihari,” says Richard Blair, Orwell’s son, via e-mail.


His father's 'opium' connection is interesting as well because Motihari is part of East Champaran district, a region from where in 1917 Mahatma Gandhi launched the civil disobedience movement that ultimately resulted, 30 years later, in the departure of the British from India. Gandhi had been moved by the plight of cultivators in Bihar who were being forced to produce opium and indigo for the lucrative markets of China and Europe respectively.

&gt; The house would have turned to rubble were it not for a campaign by a Motihari businessman, Debapriya Mookherjee, to convert it to a memorial.

&gt; ""The people of Motihari do not realise that even if Orwell was an Englishman, he was anti-imperialist and wrote against colonial exploitation,"" said Bishwajeet Mookherjee. ""I made the film to educate Biharis about Orwell, to tell them that a great writer was born in my home town. It's only right that we should honour his memory.""

False,t5_2x2wj,0,"Bethesda RPGs since Morrowind are all sharing one unique aspect: Every piece of clutter, everything that isn't nailed down is an item you can interact with. You can pick it up, put it in your inventory and at the very least sell it for one Gold (or other currency). Every book on a bookshelf is an, albeit short, book you can read. Every item of food on the table is food you can consume, the dishes are all single objects that since Oblivion have mass and react to the player's or NPC actions.

I don't know if you have noticed this, but other games (outside of recent survival sandboxes), other RPGs, don't do that. The only game prior to Morrowind that had this level of detail was Shenmue - and it had a much smaller, more limited world. Because Bethesda has chosen to render so many dynamic objects the player can interact with at will, drop anywhere, arrange, shove, take, their games had to compromise in other areas. Loading times between interior and exterior scenes come to mind, visuals that haven't advanced as much as the rest of the industry in the case of Fallout 4 would be another example.

Well, that's one aspect at least. This of course has nothing to do with weak main quests (a staple of Bethesda RPGs). The open nature of these games however is what draws people into them. It's not easy to get used to this. I needed *seven* attempts to finally get into Morrowind over a period of several years and only the seventh time, it clicked and I proceeded to play this game - which is far more open than Skyrim - for hundreds of hours. Whad did I do? I decided to follow a specific path. I created a mysterious Dunmer and chose to play as a magic exploring master thief, totally ignoring the story and quests. That part about everything not nailed down being up for grabs? I stole more than I could carry, pickpocketed everyone, emptied entire cities of their valuables. In between the stealing, I was exploring, gradually uncovering every inch of the map. I crafted items that allowed me to levitate, dive, walk on water or be invisible indefinitely, a collection of enchanted rings for every occasion. Great fun.

Suddenly being allowed to go anywhere in a game can be totally overwhelming, like when you're moving out of your parents' house and now can do *anything* (conditions apply) or when you have 485 games on Steam and nothing to play or 20 pairs of shoes and nothing to wear. 

There are open world RPGs out there with more direction and more consequences. The Witcher series is popular, especially its last, extremely polished and beautiful incarnation. Geralt the Witcher is a clearly defined character players can easily identify with. 

Piranha Byte's RPGs, the Gothic and Risen series, are known for their challenging gameplay, branching paths, dense, organic worlds and snarky NPCs. They offer choice and exploration, but limit the player by always placing just a little bit too strong enemies at key choke points in the world. This leads to a focused experience, because you have to choose your battles, be careful where you're going instead of just walking straight ahead everywhere like in Bethesda's games. A pack of wolves or a powerful orc will rip you to pieces, but you know you will return at some point, stronger, more skilled at combat and overcome the obstacle. Perhaps these games are more suited to you, at least if you're persistent and can deal with frustration. Gothic 2 is arguably the best game they've made (can be played without knowing the first, much clunkier game), Risen very similar, more accessible and has a more modern presentation, but perhaps not as brilliant.

False,t5_2qh8b,0,"A friend of mine pointed out to me the *brilliant* political manoeuvre that David Cameron has played by making the PM job a poisoned chalice for his opponents.

There is only 3 ways that they can go from here:

* Leave campaigners step up to run and ruin their political career as the UK goes through an incredible recession after invoking Article 50, showing that Remain was right all along.

* Leave campaigners ruin their political career by stepping up to run for PM and NOT invoking Article 50, thereby showing that all their Leave campaigning was Machiavellism at its finest.

* Leave campaigners DON'T step up to run and ruin their political careers (same reason as above).

When you think about it, no one is talking about the promise that Cameron made before this started, where he pledged to lead the country through the negotiations. He broke that promise (by resigning) but no one cares, because *he's already resigned* and there are more important things to worry about. He's essentially untouchable now, because he's gone on record opposing Leave. He has washed his hands of the situation; political capital means nothing to him now because he's a lame duck, and he's already rich enough that it doesn't matter anymore.

On the Conservative Party side, Theresa May, the Home Secretary, is considered to be the frontrunner to be the Tory party leader. She may have campaigned for Remain, but to me, she's a Leave politician in all but name; she wants to remove the European Declaration for Human Rights (for some reason) and has a vision on immigration that is too similar to Nigel Farage's for my liking (last I heard she wants to expel **ALL 'FOREIGNERS'** from the UK, even British citizens who aren't white).

Michael Gove...well...it's Michael Gove. Enough said. The man thinks that just because he has a strong opinion on the matter is more than enough for him to tackle the problem. And he made a complete hash of it during his time as the Education Secretary.

Boris Johnson certainly didn't believe in Leave; he only joined Leave because he thought it was his best chance of being Prime Minister (I can't imagine that he would've wanted to be the most public face of Leave if he didn't have support), but that political career is (temporarily) over because Michael Gove stabbed him in the back, so he pulled out to salvage what remained of his career and perhaps try again later in a few years.

Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is in trouble because he supported Leave indirectly (at odds but the rest of his primarily pro-EU party). I've seen a few articles mention 'mismanagement of Remain', but very few seem to realise that he was personally for Leave, so he assumed that Remain would win without him needing to do anything, allowing him to attempt to sway Leave voters with anti-EU rhetoric in the upcoming general election. However, Leave won, and so his perceived lack of effort in doing anything is being highlighted with a magnifying glass.

False,t5_2ssp3,0,"&gt; Once again, when the word European is used, it means England and France, with some small remarks towards HRE. To this article's credit, it at least specifies western Europe, but still, little mention of Iberian peninsula, scandinavian kingdoms or Italy.

I think you've hit on a very important issue here, not only in discussions of feudalism but for medieval history in general, which has been, and still is (although I would argue that there has been quite significant improvements in the last two decades or so), very Franco-centric. England gets an awful lot of attention too, as you note, but it's usually off on its own and treated separately, while France becomes the model for the rest of Europe. It's not uncommon to find books, especially text-books, speaking about things like kingship or feudalism as if they applied to the entirety of Europe, but which are only backed up by French examples. All of this is despite the fact that France itself is incredibly diverse, but somehow the rest of Europe is exactly the same. Like I said, I think this has changed in recent decades, but it's still a huge problem, especially in textbooks and syntheses.

&gt; students going into history have to be essentially re-trained in what the term means - that right there is a waste of time. [....] we should be pretty clear about them being modern classifications and constructs 

100% agree on both of these.

&gt; 1) no one seems to agree even remotely on what the definition should be, and ends up defining his own version of it. 

I don't necessarily think this is such a bad thing, although it exasperates the problem of public understanding. See my reply about to /u/TenMinuteHistory.

&gt; 2) public at large has encountered the term and misunderstood it thoroughly. This is a serious problem, unlike what some more academic-oriented people would have you believe (I encountered the attitude of ""eff the public, they're morons"" pretty damn often) - gripe all you want about middle ages being misrepresented in media, but who is to blame for that if not the historians who refuse to crawl out of their offices to talk to the unwashed masses? 

I'd have to agree with you on the whole here. Frankly, I think that if we want to re-habilitate feudalism at all as a useful concept for historians, and I do think it's worthwhile, then we need to expunge it from the earliest contact students have with medieval history. Primary and secondary teachers, documentary makers, museum educators and popular culture writers all use feudalism as a confusing shorthand for knights, castles and violence. I absolutely agree that it's up to academics to get out of their offices and engage with these groups, especially those who work with children and teenagers. AskHistorians is one way to do that, but there are lots of others too.

&gt; In my opinion, fedualism needs to go the way of the broadsword: the term became too corrupted and generally misunderstood to be useful.

It's a legitimate opinion, and one which the majority of medieval historians probably share (in this thread, /u/idjet has been making the case eloquently).

False,t5_2qhqb,0,"You've raised a very good point here. I was of exactly the same opinion as you when Corbyn won the leadership. Actually, since then and because of that, I've taken an interest in politics and have been engaged ever since.

There's still a huge part of me that wants to believe the message you outline - 

&gt;Our country is in a mess because of charismatic spinners. It is ironic that Labour MPs think the only thing that can save them is to find their own charismatic spinner.

I used to think that a conviction politician could change all of that. And maybe they can - but is Jeremy really the man to do it?

I've been paying very close attention to the way he's been operating since becoming leader, and it seems that he simply doesn't have the social intelligence / awareness, or general intellectual grunt to pull it off, even if it were possible. 

I hate this fact, but the older I get and the more I learn the more it seems like an inescapable reality - politics is a game with its own subtle rules, and requires a highly perceptive smooth operator to traverse the landscape to get to the intended destination.

Jeremy seems unwilling - and also incapable of playing this game. It is for this reason I fear that he is likely to simply be a dividing force, rather than a uniting one.

Also, I've been looking quite a lot into the man himself, and I'm afraid to say that he may well be just as egomaniacal as his counterparts on the right, in his own leftists kind of way. 

Just because a person pays very detailed lip service to all of these liberal causes, does not mean they are humble or interested in serving the will of the people. Also, if this is what he is doing, that doesn't mean that he isn't also a very nice man.

It's totally possible that, as an egomaniac, his whole identity is based around demonstrating that this is who he is to the public. It's possible to be doing the right things for the wrong reasons. 

Recent events that have reinforced this opinion for me, is his unwillingness to stand down from the labour party after the no confidence vote. His own party don't want him, because they understand the political game, recognise his unwillingness and inability to play it, and they know that while he is leader, he is dividing the party and making them unelectable.

I know - I hate that this is how it works too, but the fact is, a party has to get in power to make changes! Politicians have to be pragmatic about this fact and unfortunately, play the game. 

Maybe were circumstances different I'd be more tolerant of his unwillingness to play the game, but with the whole Europe debacle going on (which is something he always wanted, by the way), we don't need a leader who is dividing the party right now.

'Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.' We, friends, are those Fools!

You're here looking through guild recruiting posts, right?

So ask yourself these questions:

Do you want a guild that is established, active, with lots of players to run content with?

Do you want a guild that has real events for PvP and PvE, even high end dungeons and trials?

Do you want a guild that takes an interest in your character, your build, your equipment, and your level of enjoyment?

Initially established as an XBox One clan for Destiny, Fool's Errand grew rapidly to become one of the largest and most active XBox One clans in that game.

Fool's Errand players are mature, ranging in age from their 20s to their 50s, and hail from all over North America, Europe, and beyond. We are veterans, active duty military, parents, and all sorts of other 'grown ups' who are committed to friendly, mature, and team-oriented PvE and PvP gameplay.

Our experience indicates that this guild is **NOT** good fit for:  Players that don’t participate in guild events, don’t use guild chat, and aren’t interested in playing the game with others.  This guild is vibrant and active, and requires a certain level of investment of time, interest, and activity for a player to get the best experience.

**We fight for Jorunn the Skald-King and the Ebonheart Pact!**

**Our job is to help our members get to VR16, to have excellent top-tier builds, and to help them get best-in-slot gear.**

**Our members' job is to be active in guild chat, to help fellow guild members, to participate in guild events, and...most importantly...to have FUN playing!**

**We run Trials twice per week, so we are also looking for players who are ready, willing, and able to hit Trials.**

**If you enjoy crafting, please note that we also have a dedicated crafting guild available for Fool's Errand members, with its very own guild bank full of crafting materials.**

**We host guild events *at least* five nights a week, alternating between PvP content and PvE content, including endgame content.**

**We also host a weekly public event focused on helping other Ebonheart Pact players grab skyshards, clear content, and gain XP.**

**We are looking for more players from Australia, New Zealand, and Oceania to expand our ‘overnight crew.’**

We are actively looking for like-minded players to join our ranks. If you are seeking a guild that will help you level up, gain experience and equipment, and have fun doing it, then perhaps Fool's Errand is a good fit for you.

False,t5_2qhcv,0,"I see a lot of posts regarding the referendum referring to the House of Lords and how ""undemocratic"" it is and hence we should ""get our house in order"" before we complain about the EU. Once upon a time I was disgusted that the HoL was unelected ...but then I took the time to look into it and I changed my mind.  

Regardless of how you voted I think more people should be aware of the HoL and what it's actual role is.  
The Lords is unelected which is its great strength and should be free of any public vote. It is the only chamber that actually reads proposed legislation and makes useful debates and amendments.  

The original idea of the house of Lords was as a place for laws to be scrutinied once it had gone through the house of Commons. The task being to see new laws in the cold light of day, without the bias of party politics clouding the views of the Lords.  

The Lords decide if the new law is good for the country. In most cases, it might agree, but in some cases, there might be an overtly political agenda at play, and the Lords might decide that it wouldn't support such laws.
The recent moves to remove Lords with no political links, such as hereditary ones is a double sided sword. On one side, it means that people get their Lordships on merit, on the other hand, their Lordships mean they are endebted to someone for their position. In cases where Lords had to make decisions with political overtones, the public cannot be sure that their decisions are not tainted by their agendas.  

By removing the whole house of Lords, this whole issue is magnified to a point where all power is found in the house of Commons. The Commons does a terrible job of both debate and making useful critical comment on bills. The undemocratic party whip system means Commons MPs have to vote with the party to gain any promotions, whatever the party has decided, however unworkable and unjust. Their constituency view can go hang if it differs. In cases where there is a huge majority for the Right or the Left, there is no other way open for the public to limit the more outrageous laws created by government. The Westminster Commons does a great deal of damage to UK by protecting vested interests against the public good whichever party is in power and is in far greater need of wholescale reform.  

On that basis, the removal of the house of Lords would actually be bad for democracy, but I guess this depends on your knowledge of the political process - and what agenda you are ultimately following. If, for instance, the driver for removing the House of Lords is due to them having previously not supported your new laws, you have to wonder if they had a point?!  

The problem with the reform of the Lords is that the direction of change (since Labour's reforms in 1997 which resulted in removing the majority of independent peers, leaving virtual all the remainder there by virtue of political patronage) is towards creating a second political chamber -- which is precisely not what's needed.
Election by independent body to the House should be completely free of political patronage but consist only of people that have proven their worth to wider society and want to give of their time and wisdom in public service to the country.  

While there will be benefit in electing peers for, for argument's sake, single 15 year terms, we need to insulate them from party politics so that they can provide oversight &amp; insight that's as independent and impartial as possible.",False,1467374906,ukpolitics,,7,fastdruid,0,,t1_d4v50d6,1471133835,7,t3_4qq30p,,d4v86jb

&gt; In yet another slap in the face for an already reeling Europe, moments ago Austria&amp;#039;s Constitutional Court ruled on Friday that the presidential runoff election must be held again, handing the Freedom Party&amp;#039;s narrowly defeated candidate another chance to become the first right-wing head of state in the European Union.

&gt; As a reminder, one month ago - in the aftermath of the Freedom Party candidate&amp;#039;s loss by a negligible margin in the Austrian presidential runoff election - five voting districts were being investigated over postal vote irregularities in the close-run presidential election.

&gt; Allegations of fraud arose from the far-right Freedom party of defeated candidate Norbert Hofer, after the Green candidate Alexander Van der Bellen just scrapped ahead with 31,000 votes when the postal ballot was counted.

False,t5_2qhqb,0,"First, it's not doublethink and the two views can be seen as entirely separate or together.

You *can* take the view that referendum was undemocratic. You can debate that it's wrong, that's fine, especially if you go by the literal sense - nobody is questioning the fact that a referendum is a democratic process. You can argue that the circumstances and the process was not in keeping with democratic soundness.

Second of all, it is perfectly in keeping with democracy to voice a position that you believe in. Most changes that happen in democracy are overturning previous democratic decisions. This is especially important when the circumstances call for it. It would be incredibly arbitrary and completely contrary to democracy to believe any decision is final and incontestable. You are treading on your own double standards of democracy.

And third, we have a representative democracy, not a direct democracy. This referendum was called as means of a political instrument, not as a means of ordinary decision making such is the case in Switzerland and other countries. Some of these countries do a much more careful job judging how these referendums must be setup. 

Fourth, many countries have re-held referendums, especially on the back of further negotiations, and it has been in keeping with democracy. 

Fifth, it is entirely arbitrary to depend on the robustness of a single judgment when circumstances are fluid by nature, to be unwilling to increase the robustness of a choice means there isn't a strong mandate for such a wide ranging, history-defining, irreversible decision to be made.

Sixth, you may have not seen any protests before the referendum, but perhaps you weren't looking for them. The petition that accumulated millions of signatures was created by a Brexiteer (well before the vote). Farage promised to continue campaigning for a new referendum to get the result he wanted, he's not campaigning for one now. 

And lastly, do you have any idea how many people have been protesting just over the fact that the referendum got held in the way it was long before the vote? Personally, I have been worried ever since the day Cameron announced it on the manifesto because I knew it would be an uphill battle merely on the basis of how anti-immigrant, anti-eu and pro-fear the press is.

False,t5_2qh4j,0,"It is important to remember that for all the deliberate falsification of history for propaganda reasons by Russian government today it isn't as obvious and clear-cut as it was the case with Germany which was defeated, occupied by foreign powers and had its leaders tried for war crimes.

First of all the propaganda spanned *generations*. The Soviet regime which instigated the occupation in 1939 was one of the victors of the war and carried on to 1953 when Stalin died using the myth of the ""Great Patriotic War"" as a nation-building tool. It proved successful enough that it carried on throughout the entirety of the Cold War as an unifying strategy for a country that until 1941 had to use brutal force to stay together. After 50 years of this propaganda you have at least two generations who never knew anything else. This is similar to suggesting ""America brought 9/11 on itself"" in America. It goes against the national spirit in Russia and a government that advocates a critical approach will be considered to be treasonous by many who grew up learning the mythology. The pushback against any placement of the Soviet Union alongside Germany rather than its victim is going to be very strong and come from the people directly.  You have to remember that the USSR lost countless people in the war and the survivors and veterans have the mythology of being defenders of the ""good guys"" as the only true valuable thing in life. By painting the Soviet Union in its entirety as no different from Germany you are depraving these people and their children of their entire self-worth. There has been little else for them to have in a poor and oppressed society that Soviet Union allowed.


Secondly there are two important *practical* factors behind the mythology being so resilient aside from the propaganda:

---- 

One has to do with how the Soviet-German treaty was executed.  Despite having a secret clause Stalin did not immediately attack Poland and waited to when the war was decided and Germany moved already *behind* the agreed demarcation line. Thus the invasion of Poland was [concluded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland#/media/File:Poland2.jpg) even before any Soviet troops invaded because there were barely any forces left able to resist the Red Army. As a result of this the actual partition of Poland was [different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ribbentrop-Molotov.svg) from the agreed upon in the treaty and Germany took more territory. While Stalin excused his delay with the war against Japan I would think it was entirely deliberate. He *tricked* Germany into attacking Poland with the expectation of Soviets doing the same and then made Germany look as the only aggressor. Also you have to remember that Germany remembered that their relationship with the USSR was purely practical and that Stalin formally offered to intervene against Germany with the western powers on at least two occasions - in 1934 when Nazis took over and in 1938 before the Munich agreement. They wanted to guarantee Soviet neutrality by offering them some of strategically valuable territory. You should never consider the Ribbentropp-Molotov pact to be an expression of true friendship or even unity of purpose (destruction of Poland). *It was pure political expediency in the shortest of terms*.   As for Stalin's excuses the war against Japan was already won from the practical standpoint by the end of August 1939 with Japanese forces totally destroyed in the battles of [Khalkin-Gol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Khalkhin_Gol) and at the same time the USSR didn't begin to mobilize its European troops until 3rd or 5th of September! 

The other was the official pretense of entering Poland and also Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia ""in defense of Russian population in the territory"". There indeed *were* Russian, Belarussian and Ukrainian minorities in those countries and the portions of Poland inhabited by Belarussians and Ukrainians were acquired in a Polish-Soviet war after the collapse of Ukrainian and Belarussian independence movements after WW1. There were people, and not just insignificant minorities, who welcomed the Red Army as liberators from Poland the same way Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia welcomed Germany two years later. As if to further drive the point Polish military did not fight the Red Army in 1939 *by explicit order of the high command*. That order came as the result of the Polish-British alliance which was valid against Germany but would be [voided](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Polish_military_alliance#Analysis) immediately should Poland find itself in a state of war against the Soviet Union. Therefore Polish authorities sacrificed the futile and rather symbolic gesture of resistance (the war was already over with Germany disposing of the entirety of Polish army on their own) to preserve the alliance with Britain (however useless it turned out to be). Both Poles and Soviets knew however that it was a practical measure and USSR instituted mass repressions against Poles and murdered thousands of military officers in [Katyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre) as a deliberate measure to weaken any potential insurgency. Still the territory which Soviets invaded had only a *minority* of Poles (except Lithuania, which was a point of contention between Poland and the Republic of Lithuania created in 1918) and as history showed [later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia_and_Eastern_Galicia) the majority of Ukrainians didn't really consider the Poles to be legitimate authority as the Polish government claimed. While mass murder is always mass murder there must be causes already in place for such violent event to occur to begin with.

So it is natural that Russia has an overwhelmingly hostile  attitude towards any potential recrimination against Soviet Union in WW2 as an aggressor not only because of the long-lasting propaganda but also because of the actual  nature of how the aggression occurred. People want to be the ""good guys"" and will cling to all and any evidence to support it.

Think American Civil War and the issues of legality of secession and the slavery in the South. Could you imagine the opinion that it was an aggression from the North, secession was legal and that the war wasn't about slavery directly at all ever becoming popular enough in the mainstream that it would be openly discussed? You get bans for stating those opinions on reddit for example and they are perfectly reasonable ones. Far more than any suggestion that USSR was on the ""good"" side in WW2.

So just keep this in mind. There's more than blatant propaganda of Putin's regime at work here. Germany had a brief episode of Nazism and there were many people who accepted Hitler the same way you accept that your party lost the election but the government is the government and Nazi Germany did some truly outrageous things. Hitler had to ban and persecute both Communist and Social-Democratic parties in Germany which put together had the majority of votes in the previous elections. Russia - while they did many comparable atrocities - didn't also have a ""brief episode"". The ruthless regime in Russia was the *norm* since at least 1914 (excluding the 1905 revolution and the authoritarian nature of Tsarist regime in general) and the Soviets didn't invent new methods of oppression as much as just cranked up what already existed like [katorga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katorga) to the proverbial eleven. For most Russians it'd been always like that *and then it got worse*... Complaining that people were sent to camps or killed if they resisted is like complaining that it's cold in winter.

And finally as far as the Baltic states and Poland go denying the responsibility is an useful tool for inflaming the relations whenever Russia wants it as all those countries have a significant degree of ""Russo-phobic"" sentiment which plays right into the hands of Kremlin. Consider the diplomatic mess that ensued after the 2010 [crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Polish_Air_Force_Tu-154_crash) in Smolensk which killed the Polish president and numerous other important public figures. Why go out of your way to honour the past for a country which you like to present to your population as an ungrateful troublemaker at best?

However I don't think that any change in Polish-Russian and Baltic-Russian relationship is possible without admitting those facts. Which is to say it's unlikely to ever happen...",1467377636,1467375667,europe,,7,kmar81,1,,t3_4qr66h,1471133992,7,t3_4qr66h,,d4v8if3

&gt; * Passed without needing a vote, the document is a set of international human rights standards on the right to citizenship and seeks to put up safeguards against people becoming stateless.

&gt; * There are many cases of deprivation of citizenship in the world, and while this is due to different factors, many times it is evident that it is purely arbitrary, and thus connected with other human rights, said Alexei Goltyayev, the Russian representative to the Council.

&gt; * Under the new laws, any dual nationals who hold Russian citizenship, as may be the case in the former Soviet Union, can have their Russian citizenship revoked for inciting hatred.

False,t5_37urc,0,"Yeah, following subsequent research, I definitely was off about some stuff in there, and it turns out that a lot of the Tiger sightings that I found there ended up being King Tigers, and going back to the Zaloga interview he did say that the Americans ran into King Tigers way more often than Tiger Is on the *Western Front*. 

Zaloga also describes one of his ""three times"" as ""And then there was a single Tiger company up in the Bulge that was involved in some fighting."" which could lead to multiple encounters. He even said ""It definitely could have happened, there are certainly lots of gaps in the historical record both on the German side and the US side. I think the idea that the US encountered a lot of Tigers during WW2 is simply due to the tendency of the US troops to call all German tanks Tigers."" 

I have to defend Zaloga, because I think he has said nothing wrong. He's basically saying ""Tiger I encounters with American troops were actually very rare, I've only been able to find 3 separate instances where they were definitely in the same area of operations and reports are 100% confirmable. There were probably a few more, but not many"" That's an accurate, nuanced way of looking at it. 

Moran parroted this, but in a way to sound entertaining and interesting to people who aren't necessarily interested in the nitty gritty of doing history. He said, ""In *northwest Europe* between D-Day and the Fall of Germany, American *tankers* saw Tiger Is only 3 times."" Moran has taken Zalogas open-ended, trend-focused statement, and turned it into a more absolute statement. I don't like absolute statements in History, but at least he still qualified *tankers,* *Tiger Is* and *northwest Europe.*

Unfortunately, Moran was talking to a bunch of WT and WoT players, who have no idea what nuance is, so that whole thing quickly becomes ""*US soldiers of all types only saw Tiger Is or Tiger IIs three times ever through the entire war*"" like Italy and North Africa don't exist.

False,t5_2u28p,0,"Reminds me of this patriotic flyover in England. 

&gt; As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I'm most often asked is ""How fast would that SR-71 fly?"" I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual “high” speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn’t previously seen.

&gt; So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, “what was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?” This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following.

&gt; I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England , with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield.

&gt; Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing.

&gt; Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field—yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast.

&gt; Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it.. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower.

&gt; Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes.

&gt; After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet’s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of “breathtaking” very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach.

&gt; As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn't spoken a word since “the pass.” Finally, Walter looked at me and said, “One hundred fifty-six knots.
What did you see?” Trying to find my voice, I stammered, “One hundred fifty-two.” We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, “Don’t ever do that to me again!” And I never did.

&gt; A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer’s club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, “It was probably just a routine low approach; they're pretty impressive in that plane.” Impressive indeed.

&gt;Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. It’s ironic that people are interested in how slow the world’s fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed, however, it’s always a good idea to keep that cross-check up…and keep your Mach up, too.

&gt;which is why our government has chosen not to restrict non-EU migration as much as they could

Our government has chosen to not restrict non-eu immigration because businesses love cheap labour. And speaking of Labour, the Labour party admitted to wanting to import as many foreigners as possible so it had more labour voters.

Our main difference is you don't seem to want to accept the fact that you do *not* have a right to simply go where you want. A sovereign nation must decide to invite you in as a guest.

The right to go wherever you want in other nations is not worth as much to me as it is to you or some other people clearly. Clearly there are also some people who agree with me on that. I don't think either of us are going to change our minds on this

&gt; The Green party-backed candidate Alexander Van der Bellen originally snatched victory by a mere 0.6 per cent in the second round vote, which was taken to decide the new president of central-European state Austria in May. He had made it to the round alongside Freedom Party candidate Norbert Hofer, who campaigned to protect Austria from mass migration and Islamification.

&gt; Given that the election was carried by just 30,863 votes, and up to 740,000 postal votes are in question the Constitutional court has now ruled the vote should be re-run, although the date for this has not yet been announced.

&gt; Hofer, who initially told press his party would not be contesting the elections despite the close vote before the serious voting problems became apparent, campaigned on his Euroscepticism and opposition to mass migration to Austria.

False,t5_2qhqb,0,"&gt;This simply isn't true, as it has to work both ways.

But it does work both ways. Would you be arguing this fiercely if the vote had gone the other way? Would you accept someone insisting that because we hadn't voted to leave, it wasn't fair to force them to follow a path that they didn't think was in *their* best interest?

&gt; What right do Brexiters have to force me, someone who was born both British and European, to give up my European nationality, because they find it isn't in their best interest?

Why does having a European nationality mean that you can veto local votes? Having a second nationality doesn't give you special rights over everyone else in your other (primary?) location. And I'm not sure leaving a trade agreement is a straight line to your now not being European as a Briton either.

But both systems are far from perfect and would do better with more democracy.

Did the Aztec report it, or the Spanish? Because there's not really any evidence for cannibalism being an integral part of the Mexica diet; most pre-Columbian historians think that it did occur as part of some religious rituals, it wasn't a widespread or common phenomenon. The *conquistadore* accounts were meant to justify Spanish colonial aims and increase financial and political support of their military and conversion efforts.

&gt;They claim that at one of these 4 day events they killed 40,000 people how can you try compare this to Europe as though the two were morality equivalent?

Because sacrifice at that scale never happened. It's a laughable exaggeration. Sacrificing 10,000 people per day would be 7 ritual sacrifices *per minute* (without any breaks, of course). I don't know how long it takes you to do a religious ceremony, but I figure it's a bit more than 8 or 9 seconds.

&gt; Maybe.Depends too. But in South Korea Are not they already have a team of camp life? Maybe it'll be after some time passes to see Western teams are trained to look to win the Korea team. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Q. It's funny. In fact, in Korea itgeodeunyo spread a lot of talk in the FPS North America, Europe hard to win. But do you see the team would be a strong team in South Korea Overwatch? 
&gt; 
&gt; Is this pagodeun Korea had been a kind of FPS games? I mean, I really like a lot of people did Enemies intensive flock to the more popular FPS. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Q. Well, somehow or the popularity of StarCraft LoL level eopeotjyo've done. 
&gt; 
&gt; Before proficient player thinks he displayed when combined talent and dedication. And Korea team'm going to pay a great effort. The game would go to the team with a number of talented people, because box office in Korea. Over time, you'll see that quite a lot of Team Korea in the international competition. North America, I think, because Europe is now the FPS has a sort of advantage in the genre, but Overwatch is not an ordinary FPS oriented team fight and a lot of cooldowns concept that exists in digging away games South Korea have sufficient competitive do. 
&gt; 
&gt; And what's more the FPS to play in North America, Europe understand we've got the popularity in Korea could not before. Koreans CS: I have to say that they remember the sudden attack, not the GO. If the user pool is also very much it's hard to push your skills. 
&gt; 
&gt; For example, in Korea CS: How can they when they practice dwaeseo GO team is matbutge and the European Convention on the'll practice? What they can practice with? Because the practice is not able to ping tapgeup team of other regions, even if few teams to practice in their country jijyo situation it is really difficult. I Korea CS: My guess jimanyo only so much one knows it bar eopgie for GO. 
&gt; 
&gt; However, the Overwatch would not have to worry about this. I heard that the game is very box-office, if users are so full of talent and motivation will be competing to climb to the top spot, spur'll practice more and more. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Q. Korea matter the familiar analytical rubbish also great. Are you even know who the players and Korea? 
&gt; 
&gt; UW, LW, MiG team I know. Itgoyo tournament in South Korea and also take care to see. In particular, they show respect and passion pouring the MiG. Including the 'Lime' Player of the UW players belonging to the team that downed three channels it can also display code written in North America, Europe players. But I can not because of the language barrier will not know much about Korea teams. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Q. Let's talk a little hero? You've Creative Mac is worth a short talk and write after neopeu, the opinion is there any change yet? 
&gt; 
&gt; Sure. Today, when our team had a game with Envy Earth I was doing very well. I released the game as a parameter. And para relative to the matsangdae also rewrote most wins. And it caught me on the straight opponents Soldier: replace the downed hero to 76 Mac and creative. Eventually we natjyo completely smashed. If only one of them, if only gunggeukgi careful timing parameter can be easily survive one of the two if both are iteunikkayo sure to leave a loaded gunggeukgi break mereusi Parana. In particular mereusi dies fact, the game is over or not yeotgoyo degree difference. 
&gt; 
&gt; After brandishing a piece of Mac Keeper neopeu very creative with outstanding Left click order to Mac's Creations Ames it is essential. Unless you can put the ongoing headshots in Mac Creative Soldier: 76 look much better for you to. Also exert great power in hanta, and also gauge gunggeukgi Cause soon the car. 
&gt; 
&gt; The biggest change is neopeu Mac's Creations is imported strengthening of the tanker. If confirmed only that the Ripper as the ball too.You're 3 allows you to attach easily drove the enemy into tankers. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Q. Besides, that was very much the place to be after a series of recent events in South Korea. 
&gt; 
&gt; It's really a great hero's place is. I see it seems to be wearing any place in the Western team scramble maps. Other'm versa almost every map. That's a tough place to write force structure's where a lot of this Notice Dana Hills on the map, but still a decent gin rot excellent yigoyo hero in that map. 
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, it is also a share of the current Western Conference format. Now North American, European competition puts limit itgeodeunyo not prevent duplicate heroes. Perhaps the ESL qualifiers starting next week, I think competition is limited chirwojil without overlapping, then you probably guess Winston also show the two strategies we often sseudeon. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Q. enjoy the inde sseundago spoken hero Parana junk rat it is not easy to match the shot, do even better fit what way such heroes as the opponent? 
&gt; 
&gt; Himdeuneyo words to express. Most'm just going to shoot it depends on the feeling. Just look at it a lot Ames seems to rise. Projectiles fired heroes like I was part of the Rat Parana junk shots forecast Ames. For example, I will have to shoot a lot of junk platforms. If one of the practice rooms parser angle of reflection of the bombs found out the location of the well can you meet many defenseless enemy. But this is just gonna find a position in the angle of reflection, I do not see it hitting the tip relative'm highly ambiguous. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Q. Thank you for responding to a long interview! Please Korea a word for those fans who liked your last play! 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you so much to everyone who loves me and gives my show! That did not even give me that Korea fans. This is an opportunity to talk to the fans in South Korea came really nice.

Not sure if as good as Neymar, only thr future will tell, but on the other hand he seems like he will be way less affected by ego and cockiness like Neymar. Jesus is really humble and down to earth, at least till now. He even talks about how his mom pulls his ear whenever he does something wrong (meanwhile neymar's dad is worried about using golden watches and fucking young bitches). I definetly see Jesus being a Brazil National Team player in the future.

About injuries we never know, right? But even before his harsh injury Ganso didnt show much athleticism or anything, he didnt even run much during a match, he was more about receiving the ball and sending brilliant passes (that changed a little bit and he is a more complete player now). Jesus runs all the time, fights to steal the ball, he is very active during a match, almost always plays the entire 90+mins, so he seems to have a much stronger physical health. Ganso got injured again btw and will miss at least the first game of libertadores' semi final lol.

Im biased since he plays on my team but i think staying is a much better choice than going for teams that wont have much of a title chance in europe. What can Lyon even do against PSG nowadays.. In Palmeiras he can fight for the brazilian league title (we are leading atm and are considered the favorites, altho it is very competitive and 6+ teams will be fighting to win, and we'll lose Jesus/Prass/Mina to the olympiad for up to 6 matches), brazilian cup, Libertadores next year....

I think Neymar did well by carrying Santos to a Libertadores victory before moving to Barcelona, it is not an easy title and will always be in his record.

Jesus also just found out that he can be an awesome CF (after always saying that he prefered to play on the wing), even tho he moves a lot. So he is still learning and evolving, if he focus on learning and performing he will be able to move to a top team and fight to be in the starting 11 when he gets there.

It's impossible to see the future. However I do trust people like David McWilliams. He has spoken several times this month on the massive advantages of unification, but Dave has no crystal ball either but his good track record at being right is unquestionable. 

One of the points he makes is that the UK makes 50 billion a year from EU foreign investments. It's now highly likely because of Brexit that that money will need to be diverted elsewhere as the UK is out. 

As the only English speaking country in the EU left, surely we will see some of that come here. Right now we only get 5 billion of EUFI and even if we are 1/15 the the UK size , even 5- 10 billion would be a unbelievable injection for this country. Again, all hypothetical based on if's and buts.

False,t5_2qh13,0,"Unless immigration patterns, birth rates and marriage patterns change a lot the US will absolutely be a latin nation by 2100.

Here are some facts about US demographics, (sources at the bottom) 

US racial demographics (as a % of total population) 

**Non-Hispanic White**

1970: 84% 

2014: 62%

2050: 47% (US Census Projection) 

**Hispanic**

1970: 5%

2014: 17%

2050: 29% (US Census Projection) 

So in 80 years, the non-hispanic white share of the population will nearly halve and the hispanic share of the population will sextuple. Extrapolate that to 2100 and the US will certainly be a Latin nation at the turn of the next century. 

Also keep in mind that these are US Census numbers which overestimate the non-hispanic white population and underestimate the hispanic population. 

These miscalculations derive from a few sources:

First the US census systematically overestimates the non-hispanic white population because it's conception of ""white"" doesn't conform to the generally accepted definition of white. 

A white person is defined by the US Census as, "" A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, **the Middle East**, **the Near East**, or **North Africa**. 

Secondly, the hispanic population is underestimated because it has been shown that the US Census significantly undercounts disadvantaged and poor populations. Hispanics are disproportionately poorer than whites, therefore it can be inferred that they are undercounted. 

Thirdly, on a similar note, the US census undercounts the hispanic population because it undercounts the undocumented population. Undocumented immigrants are wary of revealing their presence and the presence of their families to government employees for obvious reasons. By looking at other data sets to estimate the actual undocumented population (for example, money transfers to latin America, Border arrests and school enrollment) experts estimate that the US census only accounts for about 1/2 of the actual undocumented immigrant population.  This leads to a huge undercounting of the Latin population in the US, because the undocumented immigrant population of the US is overwhelmingly hispanic (83% according to DHS) with mexico alone accounting for 56% of the undocumented population. 

I just don't see how you can look at all these numbers and dispute the assertion that the US will be a Latin nation by 2100. You don't have to be a statistician or a demographer to see the trend. It's glaringly obvious. 90% of politicians and corporations certainly seem to believe it and are adjusting their campaigns and business models accordingly.

False,t5_2qi58,0,"It's really difficult to explain, because UEFA haven't released the figures regarding how much they sold the rights for last season (or they didn't last time I checked). But I'll try to explain. 

For 15/16, the overall prize pot for the market pool was around £400m. That's divided between the countries represented in the draw depending on how much they sell TV rights for. 

Say for example the rights to show the CL across Europe pockets UEFA €2bn, and the rights in England were sold to BT for €500m (a quarter of the total) the English clubs would get 25% of the market pool. This doesn't depend on how many teams qualify, so say if United lost to Gent in the qualifiers last year, it'd have been 25% shared 3 ways not 4. 

In 14-15, English clubs got 19% of the market pool, but that's to change because the 3-yearly sale of TV rights took effect for the 15-16 season and as explained, last I checked, the figures relating to it hasn't been released. However we can estimate.

Sky and ITV previously paid £400m for the CL rights to be aired in the UK, BT paid £900m for this season and the two to come. 

If that £400m previously represented 19% of the rights sold, you can work out that the collective rights sold pocketed UEFA £2.1bn. For estimations sake, let's assume every other countries TV deal increased by 25%, that makes the total a round £3bn, to which England contributed £900m, or 30%.

As the market pool is £400m, the English clubs would therefore share £120m(30%). The market pool is split into two equal pots, so in the case for the English clubs, two pots of £60m. 

One pot is based on where you finished in the previous domestic season. 40% goes to the champions, 30% to the runners up, 20% to third and 10% to fourth. City would therefore get 30% of £60m, which is £18m, and United would get 10%, only £6m. 

The other half of the Market Pool is split on the basis of the number of games played by each English club as a proportion of the total played by all those clubs in the group stage and beyond. To illustrate how this works, United got knocked out in the group stage and therefore only played six qualifying games. We played 12 games, and Chelsea/Arsenal played 8 each. That makes 34 games altogether. That means we get 12/34ths of that second pot of £60m or just over £21m. 


Adding the two pots together gives £39m, plus the £30m or so from the stage payments. United would only get around £30m in total if you work it out.

This is all based on estimation, I can't work out how much of the TV rights BT makes up, but it could quite easily be more than 30% which would make us even more and create further disparity betwene us and United. 30% is about bare minimum given the nature of the sum that BT paid. You can adjust the figures accordingly if it makes up 40% or 50%, whatever it may be.

False,t5_2qh4j,0,"&gt;There's no EU defence structire. 

[But there is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy#Operations). Just because it isn't a unified military doesn't mean that there isn't a [high level of cooperation and coordination going on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operations_of_the_European_Union).

&gt;We don't need any foreign adventures and the action in Mali was issued by UN 

I believe you are very much incorrect and misinformed. 

First of all, we are referring to [EUTM Mali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUTM_Mali), which is being conducted under the Common Security and Defense Policy I linked at the very beginning. It is run by the EU. The UN merely ratified a resolution granting that mission international recognition, but that does not make it a UN mission. The mission however is but one part [of a larger EU strategy](https://eeas.europa.eu/africa/docs/sahel_strategy_en.pdf) to restore stability to the Sahel region. 

France conducted [the initial military intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Serval) there, that is now being stabilised by the EU as a whole. This is precisely what I meant by a 'spearhead role'. All of this happened under the aegis of international law, indeed. It is run, however, by the EU or one of its member states. 

None of these matters are adventures, but vital to European security. If Islamists gain a stronghold in western Africa with none to oppose them, we run risk of letting that whole region fall to them. A large part of the Middle East already is, parts of northern Africa are, and Libya is threatened right now. 

What would that mean for us?

1. More resources for an enemy to conduct hostile operations on European soil.

2. An increasing migrant influx towards Europe.

3. The possibility of stable but hostile islamist governments forming in our own back yard.

4. The spread of this to all of North Africa and beyond in the long run.

You are looking at security and defense from a Polish perspective only. That will not do, since all these conflicts you see are interconnected. Russia is using *any* possibility to destabilise the EU to weaken our ties, including our conflict with the IS and the likes. Furthermore, America is less and less willing to fight our conflicts for us. As such, the EU had to take responsibility for its own defence and has to carefully allocate its finite resources, which brings me to the next point.

&gt;and I don't see how does it explain French absence on NATO drills in Poland, Baltic states and Baltic sea. 

As I stated above, our resources and defence capabilites are limited, but required on a global scale. The EU's obligation is not only to defend Poland or the Baltics, but the whole of the EU's territory. It does so by interventions across the globe, but in this it is dependent on the military of its member states.

There, France has the unique ability of resembling some sort of global hard power projection. France is not in Poland defending the EU because France is in Mali, in Somalia, and maybe soon in the Chinese South Sea defending the EU and our interests which include those Polish interests that go beyond immediate security concerns.

With resources constraint, the EU will only need and should only put as much defensive measures into Poland as is required to deter Russia. This can be done by nations will less global power projection because the Polish theatre is in Europe itself. Hence Germany has a far higher commitment there.

&gt;It's not a serious explanation. 

Satisfied now?

&gt;Also, what about Italy?

Similar to France but more regional. Italy's military assets are primarily naval and oriented towards Africa, or the Med. They are, for example, used in the Mediterranean right now to deal with migrants or elsewhere where the EU needs naval power. As another hypothetical example, a leaked communique of 2015 talked about a EU military mission in Libya led by Italy, in case Libya became too destabilised.

There are definite negatives for Northern Ireland if that happens - and those negatives out-weigh our benefits. I think if the UK does activate Art. 50 and doesn't want EEA access, we should push for an N.I. referendum on unification (as listed in the GFA) - for their own sakes as much as for the dream of a united Ireland.

Basically, I'm trying to deal with the current situation with as little speculation as possible. The UK hasn't exited the EU.

False,t5_2ssp3,0,"The Nazis wanted every factor of life to be subsumed under the banner of Nazism. They organized professional organizations, banned labor unions and replaced them with the DAF, created youth organizations, took over local governments, etc. Hence, traditional, religious holidays were also made into celebrations of the German *volk*. 

Christmas, for example, was deemed ""people's Christmas"" and became a celebration of the German past and German culture. While some historians have depicted popular German participation in the nazified celebration as forced or false, others see the ""People's Christmas"" as a boundary where Nazi attempts to create a culture from above met, influenced, and compromised with culture from the populace. In other words, the Nazis attempted to use Christmas to create a nationalist, *volk* community, but some of the symbols and celebrations used to do this were reinterpreted by the German people. 

An example of this is the casting of Christmas as part of the pagan, German tradition. While this had already occurred in the years prior to Hitler's rule, the Nazis expanded such tradition. Hence Christmas trees were seen as German in origin and Christmas was depicted as a celebration in which Christianity accepted the customs of the pagan *volk*. There were also more overt attempts at making Christmas symbols into National Socialist ones. Christmas candles were depicted as the German power over darkness due to the renewal of the Nazis. Hence, in most cases, the Nazis attempted to reinterpret Christian symbols as nationalistic ones rather than attempt to create an entirely new holiday. Instead, they gave new meanings to the old symbols.

Also, the materialism of Christmas was attacked as being caused by Jews. Therefore, the call to what the Nazis cast as ""Traditional Christmas"" was part of the assault on the Jews. 

A great number of public celebrations of ""People's Christmas"" were held. Such acts as bonfires, which symbolized the German renewal, and putting up public trees all bound Christmas to the Nazi regime. Mass media also united the people together and gave benefits, in the form of entertainment and community. Even charity such as the ""Winter Relief"" bound giving to Nazi regime. It became one of only two official charitable organizations in the Third Reich. 

Nevertheless, Christmas was not completely secularized. As the churches were one of the only organizations not completely nazified, they struggled against this secularization. So, while certain neo-pagan aspects of Christmas might have been magnified by the Nazis, the church managed to struggle against such de-Christianization. Ultimately, Christmas was not secularized, but the neo-pagan, traditionalist aspects of Christmas were blended into Christmas in a way that still served the purposes of the Nazis.

They think he's a bad leader with no leadership qualities, unelectable policies and that he doesn't agree with what the Labour party stands for on many issues (such as the EU, where his campaign was mediocre at best and he's clearly unenthusiastic about).

They are undermining their supporters, but, I think, Corbyn and the Labour party's membership is undermining the Labour party itself more.

When you have a move in a stock like ABX that is up 189% YTD (or AG up 315%), I'm not interested in buying from the standpoint of I feel like buying is chasing a move and being very much late to the party.  This is heightened when it comes to something like miners, which are basically more or less a leveraged play on metals and if it turned the other way, that could result in real problems. Miners have absolutely been the place to be this year, but look at most of them over the past few - when gold wasn't doing well, miners were doing abysmally badly. My other issue with miners is the idea that all manner of things can come out of left field and cause problems with miners during otherwise fine times for gold; this is especially true when you are dealing with smaller companies.

So, to summarize: 

1. I personally look at a stock up nearly 200% or 300+% in a manner of 7 months as having missed the move and I don't want to chase that. I may wind up being wrong, but I'm okay with that.

2. If the Brexit situation gets worse and/or you have problems in Europe, then you may have another push higher in gold and another push higher in miners.

3. The market is already nearly back to where it was pre-Brexit. If volatility and distress over the implications of the situation cool further, you could get a pullback in gold and a material pullback in miners that have already soared this year.

Personally, I have no desire to chase miners and really am looking for things that I can feel more comfortable about for the long-term rather than miners that can absolutely soar one year and be in the toilet in the next. If you are buying miners here, you have to believe that there is going to be further political and economic distress in the near-term. That very well may be the case, but I'm not willing to make that bet. Good luck to you if you do.

As with most of our releases, we wanted to come up with some cool artwork to pair with the vinyl.  We ordered a ream of paper, hand cut and folded it into an origami pocket, and then block printed 3 different images onto the fronts of the pocket to create the artwork.

As for the record itself, each side has 3 songs and all 500 copies are on orange vinyl.  

You can check the imgur link ( http://imgur.com/a/vknfp ) for a few close up shots of the release and I've posted a time lapse (with a song from our side!) if you'd like to see the process we went through to create every single copy of this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbWy8Kz4kFw&amp;feature=youtu.be

Now, you can reasonably argue that a number of these are irrelevant to most current-day EU countries, but many were not. 

As it stands, the 90's saw a drastic increase in military conflicts in Europe, arguably to the highest level since World War II, a great number of them driven by nationalism.

As for the economy, perhaps you have forgotten about the [early '90's recession following the Black Monday of October 1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1990s_recession) - it was by no means plain sailing in terms of the economy either. I remember how stressed out my parents were in that period, as interest rates across Europe (and elsewhere) skyrocketed and threatened to make millions homeless.

The 90's also had a first major wave of populist European nationalism, with parties like Front National in France marching in Paris with nazi-style arm bands - my French teacher brought us to one of the May Day demonstrations in Paris in '93 to watch, because he wanted us to see how scary they were, and it was a terrifying eye opener. Current day FN is a moderate shadow of its former self, thankfully.

False,t5_2yuqy,0,"As someone who possibly upvotes and/or makes those comments, allow me to explain.

First off, part of this behaviour is a backlash. I'm European, and a lot of the people I see making these comments are European as well. /r/Europe has also been mentioned as a hotbed of ""racism"" in this thread, and we see the same behaviour there. For several decades, the ruling narrative has been that you can't say anything bad about Islam. This is not a hyperbole. In Europe, we've seen a lot of pro-Islamic politics. And you can't argue against anti-Islamic sentiment without examining the relationship between Islam and left wing politics in Europe.

Second, this is not an issue of racism. Here comes the old chestnut: Religion is not race. And no matter how much that phrase bothers you (or maybe it doesn't, but it certainly bothers a lot of people), or how many people claim the opposite, you are not born as a Muslim. You are born into Muslim culture, and then as an adult decide to carry on its cultural values for whatever reasons. This is the crux: We are experiencing a massive culture clash in Europe, the peak of which being France, with a 10% Islamic population. It's not a racist claim to say that the presence of Muslims in European cultures is leading to a lot of trouble.

They didn't just spring up out of thin air, either. They were brought over as part of a political policy as practiced by our politicians. Many of us don't feel this is a wise policy, we don't see the advantage to our countries, and we want to exercise our democratic right to stop it. This shouldn't be such a big issue, yet it is. The ""far right"" has been seeking representation since the 80's, but it took 20 years for it to happen. All that time the sentiment hasn't disappeared, and it certainly wasn't caused by its leaders somehow manipulating the masses. See, this sort of condescending view towards the people who are sceptical of the benefits of Islamic immigration doesn't do much for public relations. While we're constantly cautioned against judging Muslims as a group to the point where Muslims automatically stop being Muslims the moment they pull the trigger (look at you, /r/news), the Western right is afforded none of that nuance. So why should you expect them to treat others that way? And really, how many times can you call someone a fascist before the insult loses its power? We're finding out right now, in Europe.

At present it's undeniable that the Islamic community in Europe is a sort of shadow-society. A group of people who adhere to a different culture than the nation around them, and I get the impression a lot of Muslims want to have their cake, and eat it, too. That is to say, they want to be exempt from criticism on their group as a whole, but also make use of the advantages that being a seperate group affords. So Muslims become Schrödinger's minority: A group when they are insulted, but individuals when they in turn harm others.

If you are curious about seeing things my way, imagine you receive a lot of immigrants from a group you already dislike. Say, Trump voters. Suddenly they just pile into your country, make no secret of their contempt for your goatfucking ways, start making lewd remarks to women in hijab, keep living like they're still in the South of the US draining the oil out of their trucks on the public street, the whole nine yards. And instead of trying to integrate them, the government goes after anyone even pointing out their behaviour, favours them with special privileges, etc. How often do you need to hear about your sister being harrassed by Trumpists, or your mother being sued by them for doing her job, before you decide it's a structural problem? Certainly, you wouldn't want to live in Trump's America.

Well, I don't want to live in Muhammed's Europe.

I have no problem with the individual Muslim, in theory. I do have a problem with Islamic immigration. I don't have a problem with Islam as a personal belief system. I do have a problem with Islam as a political entity that demands special rights for its members.

I have no real hatred in me for the individual Muslim. Just a pragmatism that allows me to see that traditional Islamic values are severely at odds with the Western society I love and value. And if you now say ""well, I respect your values, your rights, and I don't give two fucks if you insult the prophet or wipe your ass with the Quran, because my faith is my own conviction that needs no outside validation in the form of oppressive law"" then I can also say that those insults are not being levelled at you, because it gets tedious to say add ""(except you dudes who are chill)"" with every point you make.

yes

&gt; Do we mostly despise t-shirt fans or are we all basically manufacturing interest (i.e. t-shirt fans... or not, see question #1)?

""We"" don't do anything.  *I* despise t-shirt fans, just like I despise Patriots fans who have never been to Boston, or Notre Dame fans who have never been to South Bend.

&gt; If we're all just ""manufacting interest"", what can I do to become a #realfan?

Follow your local club/team.  Buy season tickets, go to club events, etc...  Essentially, attach yourself to the local club, and become an *actual supporter*.  Have your kids play for the youth teams or academies. etc, etc.

&gt; Am I just a perennial t-shirt fan because my passport is blue and not red?

I don't know you, but it has a lot more to do with how you became a fan of a team that is also conveniently for you, traditionally one of the best/most famous teams in the world.

&gt; What about ""American pro sports"" makes ""all loyalty basically manufactured""?

The commercial nature of American sports - particularly the NFL

&gt; What divides someone who is manufacturing interest from someone who has a ""relation to"" a team?

Loyalty.  Very few people are t-shirt fans of League One teams.  Why?  Because loyal fans/supporters are not glory chasers.  They follow the local team (or if they move, follow them from a distance).  They follow/support a team for a reason other than the team being really good.

&gt; Why do Americans ""[latch] on to seemingly random clubs/franchises"" but non-Americans don't?

It's not *uniquely American*, but it is a behavior that Americans exhibit in spades.  Again, Americans are used to our sports being overly commercialized and not having any (or at least very little) local flavor.  In small towns in Germany or Brazil, many people support the local team first, regardless of league.  In America (again, NFL in particular), we are used to overly commercialized sports, with only say 30 teams to pick from.  The only sport that bucks this trend nationally is baseball, but local soccer teams are starting to get a lot of support as well.

I'll put it this way - if an English person started watching college football (which actually is comparable to European soccer in quite a few ways), and they decided ""Alabama is the best.  I'm going to follow Alabama"" despite having zero understanding of what it meant to follow Alabama, they'd never been there, etc... would their fandom really mean as much as someone who graduated from Alabama or grew up in Tuscaloosa?

It most definately is, in the UK our biggest supermarket chains boycott Israeli goods, people will only see reports of kids getting slaughtered on the news before they get pissed off with the perpetrators.

&gt;I don't know what you are talking about, other than that one MP who lost her shadow position because of a tweet saying Israel's Jews should all be forced out of the Middle East.

That is the exact incident I'm talking about. Years before she was an MP she said Israel should be relocated to the USA. A naive comment to make, but that's not the point. She was suspended years later because of that tweet after she became MP, even though she apologized. THEN a major party member defended her saying it was a long time ago and she shouldn't be forced to resign, then he was forced to resign as well lol.

I also watched a documentary where an old Israeli female minister was interviewed and when asked how do you deal with comments criticizing Israel, she said, oh we just call them anti Semitic and they can't say anything.

On another note, relocating Israel to America isn't a half bad idea, they have a lot of space and the bigger population of jews than anywhere else in the world. Besides, Zionism is a political ideology, its not religious, I'd rather live somewhere in midwest USA than the desert in Israel.

Doesn't your scripture say you have to wait for your messiah to turn up before you can get a homeland anyway? So Zionists are already picking and choosing what rules they want to listen to, why stop there, just move the homeland somewhere less contested and you won't have such a huge PR problem with the west, the east, and everyone who prefers not seeing innocent Palestinians confined to Ghettos and frequently terrorised...

No, seriously, we really need it to get inflation up again.

From Bernanke:

&gt; The lack of currency hoarding in Europe is intriguing and suggests that the negative rates tool might be more powerful than thought. [...] The anxiety about negative interest rates seen recently in the media and in markets seems to me to be overdone. Logically, when short-term rates have been cut to zero, modestly negative rates seem a natural continuation; there is no clear discontinuity in the economic and financial effects of, say, a 0.1 percent interest rate and a -0.1 percent rate. Moreover, a negative interest rate on bank reserves does not imply that the most economically relevant rates, like mortgage rates or corporate borrowing rates, would be negative.

If you stayed in the EU it is pretty much assured these countries would join and flood England.  It costs a fortune to get to the UK from Jamaica and we have a smaller population than Serbia and Jamaicans speak English and already have established communities.


So it could work and i suspect it could happen but it could be bad for Jamaica due to the crazy brain drain. 



The USA has over 1 million Jamaicans. The UK should not have shafted Jamaicans for so long we could be invaluable when you leave the EU. The only real alternate for your labor would be India which would be a DISASTER due to their low GDP(lower than Jamaica by far) and their insane population.

Iran 1953: Helped remove an increasingly authoritarian prime minister and his government from a country that the Soviets had previously tried to keep the Red Army in 7 years prior and had nationalized (as the Soviets called for worldwide) at the heat of the tensions of the Cold War.

South and Latin America (multiple years and nations): In order to combat the Soviet Union's strategy of supporting Communist forces , later any anti-American/Western forces when that failed, the US took on a strategy of advising and supporting any government that pledged to remove Soviet influences. The alternative being the possibility of the region falling under Soviet dominion ala the Warsaw Pact nations and Cuba. 

Europe (1945 to 1985): the above also applies to this region. It's easy to forget that the Cold war existed not because of the US but because the Soviets were the aggressors (thanks Stalin) who broke post-war agreements, removed all political opposition in occupied nations, annexed territory, and spread support for leftist forces worldwide in an attempt to gain increased influence in the post war chaos.

The ""gun show loophole"" is not as TV makes it to be. private sales of guns are allowed anywhere.. the gun shows is where people meet up to trade/sell/buy. BUT a dealer has to run a background check.

You can't legally buy a gun online from a dealer without a background check - and they don't ship to your home.. they ship to a local dealer with proper permits. 

Keep people on the ""terror watch list"" - is a good idea.. but first tell me HOW does one get on that? Could I say the future ""I don't like what Clinton/Trump is doing as president"" and them BAM I get on a list? Could my name me John Smith  but a guy in the same town ""Jon Smyth"" be the one is suspected and I get put on it too? Its hard to get off once you are on it..

What I am getting at is we have a lot of gun control laws now to prevent a criminal from getting one - legally.  Now tell me a gun control law that will prevent a criminal from getting one illegally short of confiscating all guns 100%?

You're completely right. But the British public were definitely more exposed to the war than Americans. Bombings and aerial combat over Britain were very common, and naval battles were seen frequently over the coasts. Less than a thousand American civilians died in WW1, whereas ~17000 British civilians did. 67,000 British civilians died in WW2, compared to 12,000 from the US, and a large chunk of those were from American overseas territories. A tiny minority of those civilian deaths were attacks on the US mainland.

We have the same goals of living lives as free individuals in America - like many immigrants (Indian, Mexican, Asian, European, etc.). 

However, this does not always apply when you discuss different cultures. Actual cultures, not simply skin color.

False,t5_2qh13,0,"So let's take one of these examples and decide whether or not it's as black and white as you claim it is, then. Let's look at that 350 million figure.

There are a lot of factors that go into estimating a figure like that, and from week to week, there is bound to be a bit of deviation. Different expenses are bound to come up in different weeks. Also, is that spending accounting for the reduced rates in trade tariffs or taxes you gain by being in the EU? Is it including the salaries of all of the government workers and contractors it took to move that money around in the first place?

The truth isn't always so cut and dry. Lots of factors are at play in economics, and when you ask for a concrete sum of expenditures in something so large-scale, you're likely not going to get an answer with the sort of confidence you would expect to see in a basic arithmetic problem. There are biases involved in deciding which costs actually ""count"" toward that total, and there are going to be fluctuations in the actual total from week to week too, based on factors such as inflation, unforeseen expenses, and other anomalies.

I think that an estimated value is about as truthful as one can get. But how good an estimate that value is means probing more deeply into the costs that went into its calculation. If you can't figure that out, then the whole argument falls apart, as there's no way of knowing.

So, in short, not everything is purely truthful, or purely deceitful. The greatest lies have a grain of truth to them to throw us off the scent, and the most widely accepted truths tend to have a bit of fabrication in them to smooth over the harder to understand rough edges.

To understand Brexit is to understand income and wealth disparity. 
Voting patterns reveal All poor(er) regions in UK voted Brexit and all riche(er) regions voted for Remain. Basically this is how u know that too much looting has taken place in UK (and other parts of rich world thru globalization). The people who have lost everything have nothing more to lose, they want change and they don't care how this change happens (thru DEM or GOP). 

In fact this is an outstanding video which summarizes the problem 

https://youtu.be/nwK0jeJ8wxg

Euro is mathematically absurd. A North Eurozone (Northern and Western Europe) and A South Eurozone (Southern and Eastern Europe) would have worked well but not one Euro for everyone in Eurozone. It is mathematically absurd. The refugee crisis is just the last straw. US bombs countries with massive population (75M is Syria and similar pop in Iraq. Libya, Africa and other places) and these poor people are running away and trying to get into countries in Europe which are ridiculously small (Hungary 5M pop, Sweden 10M pop, Denmark 10M pop etc.,). It is absolutely mathematically absurd and a human catastrophe unleashed thanks to DC hucksters who KNOW THIS MATH AND ABSURDITY WELL and still went ahead and did it 'cos the military industrial complex needs perpetual non ending wars to get the cash flow going.

The DEM is so hopeless that they have a radically different candidate who is remarkably honest, has a clear mind, fairly decent policies and can win the election, but they still go with the stale lead balloon which cannot fly. So by default, T wins. Simple. 

More importantly, logic, math and other things don't enter into presidential voting. It is more visceral and people who have nothing to loose will chose T (and the top 0.01% has looted everything and created a massive section of people who have lost everything and have nothing more to lose. This is another reason why the poor and middle in South keep voting for GOP (against their econ interests) since they have lost everything and they don't think another party will help them and GOP is comforting with the dog whistle that they use).

The big mistake that top 0.01% did was to loot too much. They should have  looted enough not to be noticeable, but alas we crossed that point two decades back. It is just like that Hollywood sequel which has a sequel # 10 to milk every possible entertainment dollars from the public. When humans get into the ""taking mood"" they take everything possible. This is also the reason why we get unmitigated famines, floods and uncontrolled diseases which wipe out large sections of population. Nature won't put up with this nonsense and punishes people really hard for greed. Most native people (in many countries) know this well and they take enough from nature to keep the balance so that it doesn't turn violent on them. But alas this is a lesson humans have learned time and again even though there is a wealth of history. We learn from history that we don't learn from history.

False,t5_2rtne,0,"Sadly, I'm not familiar with the US healthcare other than not hearing the best stories about it. I'm fortunate enough to receive very good healthcare and support in Europe.  

I'm trying to answer your questions as good as I can now. I have been writing my bachelor's thesis partly about mindfulness, unfortunately it's not translated into English – this would definitely be my first suggestion for you where you have the ball in your court and aren't obligated to depend on someone else. The actual paper is about how the digital age has altered our personalities and the way we socially interact with other people. Plus, on how to make time and space for sustainable self-reflection in everyday life. Just on a side note.  

&gt;I apologize. I just don't understand. Do you quit your job, and how do you pay for it if you do? What kind of life do you have getting out if that's the case? No work history for months, no job... I might have overreacted.  

I get that you're very frustrated. Next time, maybe take one or two minutes before you reply so you know exactly what you want to communicate and we don't misunderstand each other. I find this very useful, especially after having discussed this during my thesis.  

So what I did was the following: I went batshit crazy and couldn't handle anything in life anymore, without being suicidal. I just wasn't capable of living through a daily routine, heavily depressed and whatnot. I decided that I need some help, was thinking about going back to therapy anyways, but I needed a ""quick fix"" to stabilise myself (very important!) before I could do that. I looked for clinics within my radius and found one, an open dynamic psychiatric clinic or however you would translate that. Nothing is closed off, there are rules and it's stationary. You're allowed to go outside, but have to give notice, or get permission in the first place. We had solo therapy, group therapy, art therapy, horse riding therapy (which was amazing), music therapy and a few other where we would learn different (cbt) methods to deal with certain situations. They could describe meds, but I preferred not to take any. Overall my experience there was eye opening, although I would never want to come back again (because I don't need to anymore). On the other hand, there were a few weird people (sorry) there – but also a lot of really nice, friendly and intelligent people suffering just like me. Don't get me wrong, it was EXHAUSTING. Solo therapy 2-3 days a week, everyday other activities and open therapy. Group therapy 2 days a week. Some people chose to violate house rules and disturb the overall atmosphere there, but most of them were chill. The usual gossip here and there. It felt like a youth hostel full of lunatics :) in a… positive way?  

I stayed there for 6 weeks. Others stayed shorter, most of them stayed for several months (2-3+).  

As for the financial aspect. I studied and worked, my health insurance overall covered the clinic. I quit my job before, was waiting tables and it took its toll on me. I get financial aid from the state for my studies (have to pay back only half of it) and I have an additional student loan. My mother luckily took out an insurance long ago where I would be paid a couple of bucks every day I'm in the clinic for. (But: I also have to pay for every day there. The only thing my health insurance doesn't cover. It's not too much, though.)  

I got out and immediately (actually I organised it while I was still there) went to therapy without a break. I'm still going to therapy twice a week and I'm very, very happy with my therapist. Before, it was once a week, I think, but we upped it. Now that I graduated and work full-time soon, we will get back to once a week, which is totally fine.  

I don't have a family to support, but I don't get support neither (which is okay, because the little I get suffices and we're not a wealthy family anyway).  

Sorry, I'm still a bit tired by doing an all nighter because of my thesis, so this may get out of hand.  

All I can suggest is. Maybe find something like that, for short-term, as long as it's not dragging you into holes of debt. But it's really worth it to just get a hold of yourself again so you're able to actively do therapy. 6 weeks in a clinic won't make your problems go away. Even therapy afterwards won't. It's progress, it takes hard fucking work and a long time. But eventually, if you're 100% in it, you'll get there. T.R.U.S.T. M.E.  

Maybe ask me some questions again after this, so I can answer them in a more structured way :) may hands are tired now. Phew.  

Wish you all the best!!

False,t5_2w844,0,"Primarily the narrative of humble colonists shucking the yoke of Imperialist taxation without representation, which itself is a form of propaganda. 

It's hopelessly high school to haughtily point out that the Revolution was organized, encouraged, and done in the interests of what was effectively the first entrenched generation of ""native"" oligarchs to the continent but that *was* one of the primary driving forces.... even so there is a large degree of truth to the story of ""freedom"" as the continental armies were not solely made of soldiers brought by the French.

As has been said the USA *was* also a nation where the notion of ""freedom"" is heavily baked into the foundation of our governing texts.  

From there you just have the rolling effect of 200 or so years of further propaganda, exacerbated by conflicts such as the Civil War and WWII which are easily framed (again with a heavy degree of truth) as the liberation of slaves and the halting of tyranny, respectively. There is very good reason those two conflicts get heavy airplay in the public education curriculum. 

-----------------------

I do mean propaganda by the way. I am being unambiguous. The notion that the United States is the most free country in the world is absolutely a form of propaganda. It is every bit as much propaganda as the Imperial Japanese propaganda that US soldiers eat babies or that North Korea needs to subscribe to their glorious leaders in the Un family. It is a form of shared social values acting as a method of control. That does *not* make it evil, necessarily, nor even untrue, but it is a way to keep citizens relatively in line with their sense of national values and as such holds a high potential for corruption and abuse both on the micro (citizens misinterpreting or too strongly embracing) and macro (outright lies to manipulate the citizenry into actions against their best interest).

--------------------------------

And then you have the fact that little things like the Spanish-American War and the US' *abominable* treatment of South America in pursuit of their own economic interests (which can and should create an uneasy feeling in US citizens as a lot of our prosperity can be tied to the resources gained from said exploitation)... 

...things like our alliance with Stalin and the USSR's overwhelming contributions of casualties to defeat the Third Reich are also swept under the rug because it wrinkles the notion that the US *always* sides with capital F freedom and any other nation is unwilling to make great sacrifices... 

... things like Britain, France, and most of Western Europe's own crimes like the Scramble for Africa (which the US participated in) as well as Britain's own imperial black marks...

... are largely swept under the rug in public education, often available only as topics for AP learners, self-studies, collegiate education, and if you're lucky through local historical sources such as family or community members. 

-----

And well, not to be elitist or arrogant but guess what kind-of person espouses the whole ""freedom"" notion both the hardest and the most unironically? They're not usually AP learners, self-studies, or college graduates. Even very capable, intelligent individuals may simply not have had the opportunities nor resources to even *be* those things. 

And **then** you have the ugly truth that many of the people who go on about ""freedom"" in the US as leaders tend to do so because it is a malleable virtue that rouses crowds towards their own interests. 

This isn't to say that when someone intones the notion of ""the most free country on earth"" to get a crowd to buy flags they aren't being sincere, but it is a form of persuasive leverage the same way other demographics can be swayed by things like demographic representation. Couple that with value systems that prioritize what ""category"" you belong to as much by what you *hate* as what you *like*, and you end up with a partnership to a very vague notion of Freedom that borderlines on zealotry.

I source this on the broad strokes of what is publicly accepted knowledge on world events, coupled with my own collegiate education in World History, US Afro-American history, Latin American history, and Modern African History. 

Hope that helps.

The fuel consumption was 7 l/100 km (40 mpg-imp; 34 mpg-US).[9] Since the engine did not have an oil injection system, two-stroke oil had to be added to the 24-liter (6.3 U.S. gal; 5.3 imp gal) fuel tank[10] every time the car was filled up, at a 50:1 or 33:1 ratio of fuel to oil. Gas stations of the time, in countries where two-stroke engines were common, served premixed gas-oil mixture from the pump. Today, owners carry a container of two-stroke oil in the car for this purpose. Because the car lacked a fuel pump, the fuel tank had to be placed above the motor in the engine compartment so that fuel could be fed to the carburetor by gravity; a trade-off of this design was an increased fire risk in front-end accidents. Earlier models had no fuel gauge; a dipstick was inserted into the tank to determine how much fuel remained.

False,t5_mouw,0,"Whoa! This is a big and very important question! Thanks for asking it.

Issues of behavior, race, and genes are a controversial subject, to say the least. One problem in our view is that some research on these issues, or interpretation of such research, is highly simplistic and prone to misinterpretation. In fact, studying racial differences is extremely complex because genetic variation (or the DNA differences between people) is different between different races, but so are myriad other factors, such as socioeconomic status, for example. But it doesn't break out perfectly by race, by any stretch of the imagination, which has led geneticists to use concepts like ""genetic ancestry"" (incidentally, ancestry information is something we provide to our participants who provide DNA samples!), which is related to but different from socially constructed concepts of race. To give a concrete example, in the United States African American is considered (by the US Census at least!) as a racial category. But as population geneticists know, there is more genetic variation among sub-Saharan African individuals than there is in the rest of the world *combined!* So having a single category of ""African-American"" kind of doesn't make much sense from a genetics perspective.

Second, genetic ancestry (or race, for that matter), at least in the U.S. is related to differences in genetic variation, but also to differences in social/educational/occupational opportunity, nutrition, healthcare, justice system, etc., often in ways that are discriminatory. So any study of group differences between two races (or ancestries) is totally confounded between genetic and environmental influences on behavior. Parsing which of these effects is important, or most important, is extremely difficult (hence, some of the poor research mentioned above!) This is why genetic research is often done within a particular ancestry (e.g., conduct a study only on East Asians, or only on Europeans).

Third, it is very important--crucial, in fact--to understand that the individual effect on behavior of any particular gene, or genetic variant, is tiny. So small that you can't even detect that it results in behavioral differences among individuals unless you have sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of individuals. What does that mean? It means that even if there were a genetic variant discovered that is associated with ""thriftyness"" (to use your example), it would only make an individual, maybe, .002% more thrifty... hardly a major influence!

False,t5_2qh4j,0,"I know people who lived through it and it was very much what he says. The brutality of Soviet occupation had two basic causes - the nature of any social interaction during wartime and the need of the Soviet-supported government to establish control and/or legitimacy during the civil war with various factions of the Polish Underground State which lasted 1944-1949 or so. Once they had all they needed to secure their rule the repressions ended (albeit not by the government's good will)  beyond what is typical in any authoritarian country. German occupation was aimed at gradual extermination of all Slavic population. The communists despite their shortcomings did establish a country where you could live as long as you didn't challenge their authority. That wasn't something the Nazis had planned for Central and Eastern Europe as their ideals were based on race rather than political class.

It's fairly straightforward but I noticed that after 1989 people who identify with political views of the current ruling populist party tend to exaggerate the nature of communist occupation of Poland and put it on par with Germany's. It is probably likely that the 45 years of communist occupation did equal amount of social and economic damage as the 5 years of war and German occupation but you can't put the two in the same category. However twisted the ideas behind real socialism were it intended a *development*. It just couldn't deliver it properly - although a lot of the fault lies with the people in power after 1989 and the society. Poles didn't object to socialism or communism as much as to political repression and economic crises.

Yes, Reason and Reasonable are exactly what it is to me. It's exactly what the Great Seal of the USA means by Reason.  ""Democracy has been hacked"" themes of this show are very much about Reasonable in terms of deviation from the Great Seal Mythology!

False,t5_2qhcv,0,"He begins his video by referring to the current situation as a constitutional crisis. That's just plainly not true. If we ignored a democratic vote that would be a constitutional crisis, but in his last video he explained that the UK retained sovereignty over EU laws, so how can us deciding to remove ourselves from those laws constitute a crisis? Either he was lying then or he is mistaken (or lying) now, because he has contradicted himself.

There are a lot of different sorts of bias. One is selection bias. By presenting all the facts from one side and none from the other you can make it seem like the situation is different to how it actually is. For example focusing on the things people got wrong rather than demonstrating why the things they got right are unimportant results in a decision making process where you are not undertaking the correct action but the one which was most honest. Whilst that might seem fair it is also not the rational choice. If one side was right, and then said 100 extra things that were wrong, then ultimately they would still be right. When making decisions you have to base them only on the things that are correct and not ever on the things that are wrong.

Another bias is information bias - the tendency to only look for evidence that will support your position. This is what I have seen the majority of the remain side, including this guy, do incorrectly. If you want to have a narrative that people are racist then google leavers are racist and you will get a ton of supporting evidence. Focus on a few people who were duped by what some people were said and present that as the only information and you miss the story of all the people that were not duped by it or voted due to other reasons entirely.

If you think that proving someone wrong is the only way to demonstrate that they are not biased then you are sorely mistaken and you should analyse how you arrived at the conclusions that you have in a more rational logical manner.",False,1467397066,ukpolitics,,0,drukath,0,,t1_d4vdqj5,1471141198,0,t3_4qq30p,,d4vngqu

False,t5_2sa8b,0,"Because if it's truly old-school Native American cuisine from before western settlers came in and brought spices and modern cooking utensils and techniques, it isn't very interesting.  Campbreads, fire-roasted meats, frybreads, various cornmeal-based items, porridges, dried meats, pemmican, wild rice, etc.  

I mean, if you're NOT talking about Aztecs or Mayans, you're talking about pre-agrarian nomads or semi-agrarian stone age people.  Personally, I ain't super interested, or rather, been there done that?  

Regarding the foods that WERE worth cultivating and integrating into our own culture, ""traditional american foods"" are basically european-native-american fusion cuisines anyway, like smoked salmon, succotash or even clam chowder, and if you're willing to realize that indigenous peoples of the Americas continue below the Rio Grande, well, holy shit most of Latin American cuisine is based on native food, and it's AMAAAAZING.  But then again, they were a much more advanced group of cultures that made it out of the stone age.  Pyramids and megacities and written languages.  Even then, if you want to go super historically accurate, some of the Aztec and Mayan stuff is interesting, but a far cry from the tastes people are interested in these days.  Even xocolatl isn't what you think it is--there's cornmeal in there and it isn't exactly sweet, there's no milk, and it's not what you'd think of as hot cocoa with chili peppers.

I mean...I'm sure you could do prairie dog or antelope with juniper berries and pinon nuts, maybe some roast pumpkin or yucca, a side of wild rice with cranberries and walnuts, some bannock or frybread.  It'd be all something Native Americans could cook, it'd be delicious and modern, but still very traditional ingredients.  But, you know...we already do this sort of thing all across America.  If it's ""inspired"" by Native American cuisine, then it could be awesome.  If it's straight pure Native American cuisine...no offense, but I don't see what is so trendy, cool, or special about stone-age cooking techniques other than marketing to white liberals who are looking for the next big thing or want to check off a box on a cuisine they haven't tried yet.

However, and I DO mean this quite seriously, there's an absolute plethora of local edibles and lost foods that people don't eat as much as they should, whether it's dandelion greens, purslane, jack in the pulpit, cattails, clover, amaranth, burdock, milkweed, solomon's seal, acorns, puffballs, common lawn mower's mushrooms, squirrel, sea lettuce, sorrel, orache, shepherd's purse, pineapple-weed, oysterplant, cress, mallow, nettle, dulse, bladderwrack, or even stretching flour with the cambium of a tree (a la Adirondacks).  I think it would be really cool if you were to integrate local and seasonal ingredients like these into a menu, and might be a nice lesson to re-learn from the people who lived here long before us.

It's this attitude that's bringing down America. 

 The fact that this guy is ""forced"" to be an asshole for most of his 74 years because he's facing competition from much larger companies that are given preferential treatment by government at all levels doesn't make it right.

You know, before I started travelling to Europe I felt all the protectionism for small mom-and-pop businesses was a terrible idea.  But realizing that individuals or families can safely run a business for generations this way - perhaps a somewhat marginal one, but it provides a _good living_ for the whole family.  I come back to a spot years later, and the same people are there, providing the same very competent service with somewhat newer products. 

It's one of those things that America has lost - the idea of a ""good living"".  Now there are a huge number of horrible jobs, and a tiny number of really decent ones (and I say this as someone who manages to get those tiny number of decent ones - but my friends...)  

Millions of Americans believe that it's perfectly acceptable for a full-time job to pay less than living wages.  They consider some jobs are just not worth paying for.

They should see a cashier in a Berlin supermarket - these are professionals and man, the velocity and accuracy is just amazing.

I don't got raw combined numbers, but vendors across the world have been getting stock daily, even if in small batches. I've watched live as stocks of 20-50 cards were bought out in minutes hourly/daily on some vendors.

[MSI 10 series shipment to the NL alone that I remember from 18 days ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/4nuiq6/msi_107080_stock_in_china_ship_to_holland_lol/)

I confidently made my post as I've seen hundreds of posts about people getting their 10 series cards and that is just Reddit alone. 

Add it all together and you're easily looking at thousands of people having 10 series cards and/or being able to buy them in stock at not gouged prices, at least in Europe. 

[Comment from Gibbo from OcUK alone:](https://forums.overclockers.co.uk/showpost.php?p=29722264&amp;postcount=4565)

&gt; I have faith that Ben will sort us out as he is doing a great job, the EVGA gods just need to send more stock our way because in the end all that is happening is MSI and Gigabyte are winning EVGA customers due to the volumes they keep shipping us to the point we even have stock. MSI Gamer X and Gigabyte G1 have being in stock several times here and even right now 1070 Gamer X and Gigabyte G1 are still in stock because they between them have shipped well over 1000 cards into OcUK.



**Edit** Important to point out, these cards are insanely niche due to how expensive they are (For better or worse) and they're still selling like hot cakes after a month of getting daily stocks, some stores have insane preorder amounts on certain models. 

Also, Mindfactory.de lists how many they've sold, here are some that are also in stock, meaning they've shipped all that were sold:

I feel that you are somewhat clutching at straws to try to represent the referendum as undemocratic. A million more people want to leave than to remain. That *is* a mandate. While the mandate for the referendum in the first place was small, that was also a mandate, and it's not too much of a stretch to suggest that the vast majority of those who voted leave, plus at least one who voted remain (i.e. me) *wanted* a referendum. 

The non-binding nature of the referendum is matter of law. Not democracy. The government *can* legally ignore the result, but that means it's a legal non-democratic option. I personally disapprove of performing actions against the will of the people if ""it's legal"" is the only justification. 

My view is that now that we've voted we should follow through. Most of the damage has been done. And the Brexiters were correct that there are opportunities.

Im active, dedicated, serious and have all the required knowledge about being in a power faction, including stuff like team fights and koth's. Ive been playing mc since i was fk 9 y/o. Also Im a very calm kid, won’t cause any sort of trouble really and I generally just follow others. This doesn't mean tho that I can’t do stuff on my own.

Past experience? I come from the Regular factions community but have been playing hcf for about 2 years now. I’ve been in many factions like: Feral, Hollandia, Walmart, Prodigy. Mainly tho I’ve been in duo or trio factions with friends. I would really love to once again join a power faction.

Anything else you want to add? Before anyone says I’m inactive, I haven’t really been playing since map 9 because I mainly just moved to kohi (worst decision of my life). But now I’ve decided I’m coming back to my hometown. Also, not a problem to be interviewed on ts for further information.

As it stands, we know that most Britons favor leaving the European Union. Which we already knew, now it's just official. The problem is that such a thing was never supposed to happen. People weren't supposed to be upset with the EU, they were supposed to be glad to be holding hands and uniting under one banner. This referendum takes that propaganda and drags it through the mud, and showed that the EU is in need of some serious reforms.

And both groups are now between a rock and a hard place. The UK has now lost Cameron's reforms, and stands to lose a lot more if they leave, but if they stay, they'll piss off more than just the Leave people. Europe, on the other hand, can't just quietly give the UK a good deal and have the two simply go their sperate ways - it would just add fuel to the Euroskeptic movements in other EU states. On the other hand, if they try to punish the UK, that's going to imply that the UK would have done fine had the EU not been vindictive, which would actually feed right into the narrative of the Euroskeptic campaigns that Brussels is trying to muscle Europe into line, which would almost be worse for the EU.

&gt; Zeman said on Thursday he would back his country staying in the EU and NATO. He has no power to call a referendum but is an influential leader in a country where euroscepticism is widespread. The Czech Republic joined the bloc in 2004.

&gt; &amp;quot;But I will do everything for them to have a referendum and be able to express themselves. And the same goes for a NATO exit too,&amp;quot; the centre-left president said.

&gt;1) She thinks climate change is a ""problem"" and wants to do something about it, yet she was the one that sold fracking to the world. She has countless big oil money donors from the 3rd world. She negotiates on behalf of US oil companies to other governments.

This, again, is where I think her pragmatism is superior to Bernie's idealism. 

85% of American energy comes from oil, coal, and gas. Of those three, natural gas, when captured and stored safely, is by far the least harmful in terms of climate change effects. 

It's one thing to say ""we should be full renewable/green energy,"" but the reality is we have to get there first. Supporting the natural gas boom is supporting the *cleanest* non-nuclear, non-renewable option we have as we work towards green energy.

In other words, if we're not doing fracking, we need to rely more heavily on dirtier technology like coal and oil to bridge that gap. 

Supporting fracking and evangelizing it in Europe also has the side benefit of marginalizing Russia and making Europe less dependent on Russian oil, which is a nice foreign policy double benefit.

Once near City Beach i saw some weird guy insulting 2 women, screaming and acting very dangerous. Few days later i saw kids destroying public property. etc.. It was in very short term.

What is the politics direction on that? Does people like that laws? Is it reasonable in Australia in reference to safety? Maybe i felt less safe in Perth because in my country shooting or stabbing or crimes like this usually does not receive media attention because police usually wants to keep it quiet, not sure if this is only the reason, but i like that criminal face is public on media channels.

Honestly I agree with most of your points about bias, if I'm understanding you right, but I think they demonstrate that there would be *more* bias if the BBC tried to be even more impartial with regard to the claims made by leave. In this case they are the ones with the '100 things said wrong and 1 right' (being one that I disagree with, but isn't a lie) - ignoring all these claims would get the BBC accused of bias but presenting them without comment on their validity leads to a situation where people apply a false equivalency and leads to the biggest lies 'winning' - if people assume the truth lies halfway between the claims (though even with commentary by the beeb I think this effect still had a major impact anyway).

I also agree about information bias but that afflicts all sides in nearly all debates and I do my best to avoid it myself. I don't think the majority of leave were/are racist, and I think focus on that aspect is a bit of a red herring - so what if some were, they can't and shouldn't be disenfranchised, though they should be reasoned with. The major problem is I do think a lot of people were duped by the audacity of the lies from Leave - as he said in the video, if you're going to lie, lie big, because most people are decent and don't expect others to make things up on such a massive scale. It doesn't require everyone to have been, just a fairly slim percentage, to change the entire result.

Honestly I have arrived at my position from a rational examination of the facts. I recommend you do the same, given you're dismissing a law professor's opinion that we're in a constitutional crisis out of hand. Consider the Northern Ireland situation - especially the Good Friday Agreement - this is the one I believe is the most dangerous problem. Consider the devolution settlements containing EU laws that then have to be repatriated - should Westminster overrule the Scottish parliament and take them all despite it being written into the act as devolved to Scotland but actually an EU area of responsibility? Consider that the vote hands an uncertain mandate to any one of many different mutually exclusive outcomes, which may be decided on by an internal conservative party leadership election rather than put to the public. Consider that UK case law has sometimes been decided by the courts on the basis of some EU laws since we have been a member, some of which is not duplicated in our own statue books - is all that precedent now void?

Which might lead you to believe (as it did me) that he means he will start the process right away. Of course, he actually says 'people expect it'. Classic political wording, allowing him to turn away from his implied intention.

&gt; The mostly Syrian defendants convicted in Szeged, the capital of Csongrad, were part of a crowd that crossed into Hungary on Sept. 16 as hundreds of migrants forced open the border gate and police responded with water cannon and tear gas.

&gt; In a separate case, prosecutors on Friday charged two Romanians with human trafficking and one with attempted murder and cruelty for trying to smuggle more than 100 migrants from Hungary to Austria in an unventilated truck compartment last June..

Your personal opinion is worth exactly *nothing* - I associate Hitler with WWII, have you conducted a survey that concluded all those surveyed associated Hitler first and foremost with the Holocaust over other conflicts he was involved with? I can claim the majority of people will associate Hitler with WWII and the domination of the European continent rather than the Holocaust. Gee, I wonder how i'm going to support that claim. Hmmmm, maybe I can ask someone lacking the brain cells to explain it to me.


And again, the arguments are the same when addressing the narrative in relation to anecdotal evidence.

While I think the UK was wise to not adopt the common currency (so as to preserve their independent monetary policy), leaving the largest free trade area in the world is unwise, especially for a country that routinely is a net importer of goods and services. Though I'm an American, I have lived and studied in Europe, and it's amazing just how interconnected and interdependent those countries have become. Furthermore, removing the Europe's most important center of finance (London) from the European Union is not a smart decision, as it could be usurped by either Paris or Frankfurt and its global influence could be diminished.  I think the ongoing economic troubles surrounding the Brexit are temporary, but it's worth noting that the Economy of California is currently larger than the Economy of the UK. A lot remains to be seen as to how the UK will move forward. They could negotiate similar deals as Norway and Switzerland, and thus have access to both the common market and freedom of movement, which I would consider a 'best case scenario' at this point. This would likely require them to continue to accept immigrants from global crisis areas, though, which seemed to be the primary fuel behind the Brexit for a lot of voters.

Doctor means teacher and was established at the University of Paris in 1206 intended to distinguish those with masteries in academic subjects.

I give that this is a bit skewed, as the very first degrees ever were law degrees in Europe (I believe in Italy), but these were not modern JDs.

I assume you're talking about the *Monsanto protection act* an ironic title given that it doesn't contain the word Monsanto, or even reffer to GM-crops. 

What it does do is prevent people from using lawsuits to stop the sale of already **approved** crops. I bolded that word for a reason, this only applies to crops that have cleared the FDA as safe for the environment and human health. It just stops junk lawsuits.

&gt; We have no way of knowing when Monsanto used neonicotinoids as merely a seed covering or a mass insecticide

Umm.... this is pretty simple. They're a seed company, and not a commercial grower, and they don't make the chemical in question. WTF are you alleging here? That they are secretly buying massive amounts of insecticide and spraying it on other peoples crops? Seriously, paint me a plausible scenario in which Monsanto is using massive amounts of neonicotinoid without us knowing about it?

&gt;Europe has banned the use of Neonicotinoids used by Monsanto and Glyphosates made by Monsanto

Well that's not entirely accurate. But... the entire purpose of the GMO ban is nothing more then a poorly disguised tariff on cheap US corn. One of the ways you can tell that is the fact they don't ban anything made by Bayer, a German company. Or crops like Canola (rapeseed) which the EU is competitive in. 

The WTO has taken steps to stop this, calling them unfair trade practices, and will likely take further steps to do so in the future. 

You are right about neonoc's though I struggle to find a way you can blame Monsanto for coating the seeds of plants that are no pollinated by bees, to the death of bees. That seems to be the sticking point here, the entire premise of your argument is Monsanto uses Neonoc's, Neonoc's kills bees, therfor Monsanto kills bees. I'm asking you to connect the dots for me, how does a seed coated months before the plants flower, on crops not pollinated by bees, actually harm bees.

I compared this to saying Ford uses lead in the manufacture of their cars, they are obviously not responsible for the lead poisoning in Flint. 

&gt;Monsantos continued use of PCBs long after they were banned

Well that's not true. Firstly the plant you're talking about shut down 2 years before the ban. And the company that made those chemicals is Solutia.

If you want to blame them for the actions of a company they used to own, and is currently only related in name only... fine. By that logic, AirBus was the major producers of planes for the luftwaffe.

False,t5_2tg9a,0,"You offer so many grossly inaccurate historical assertions that I don't quite know where to begin.  

&gt;Modern society consists of many different races, and has for the last 3 or 4 hundred years, at least.

1) I said historically.  For thousands of years, single-race societies were the norm.  The exceptions ~always involved bloody wars or slavery. Rome is a prime example.    

You're not really arguing with *my* opinions.  There's a large body of work on historical populations' genetics, archaeology, etc., and the conclusion is that human societies and racial groups were almost completely insular [through the Iron Age and into the more present past](http://www.pnas.org/content/85/16/6002.abstract).

Once we transition into recorded history, demographic shifts usually involved war and genocide, not racial integration.  

2) ""3 or 4 hundred years"" is too generous.  What were the demographics of the early American colonies?  Initially, they were ~100% homogeneous, White.  Because there were ~no minority races within the UK and other major colonial powers.  Sure, colonists had contact with natives, but precious few integrated into the colonies.  Even after slaves began arriving, the North remained ~homogenous, and nearly completely White.  This only changed with waves of immigration that began in the early to mid 1800s.  Irish and Germans started arriving, and then the Chinese.  I mention nationalities instead of races here because society was so homogeneous at that point that even European/White people of different nationalities experienced extreme prejudice and, for lack of a better term, racism.  It's only in the last ~100-200 years that you can really claim that *American* society had begun to incorporate multiple races, and even that would apply only to the South for the first few centuries.  &lt;i&gt;Where one race subjected the other to slavery until they were forced to do otherwise.&lt;/i&gt;  Great example of a multiracial society.  

As I said, ""*large-scale mixing of truly different populations generally only occurred in times of significant turmoil.*""  Generally, the result was genocide or slavery.  

&gt;""Not to mention that generally speaking society at large has consisted of many different races, going all the way back to Rome.""

3) As I said, ""*large-scale mixing of truly different populations generally only occurred in times of significant turmoil.*""  You're holding up an example of one of the largest and most successful empires in the Old World as an example of racial mixing.  There's just one problem.  Rome is one of the **only** historical examples of warfare and mass migration that occurred on a large enough scale to actually mix populations of different races.  As an example, it ~proves my point.  The Roman Empire is possibly the only well-known example of a mutli-racial society that existed more than ~200-300 years ago.  And, again, it involved warfare, massive turmoil, and wide-scale slavery.  

&gt;There were black men in Rome, there were Latins, there were germanic white men, there were middle easterners.

FYI, Latin is a language, not a race.  ""Germanic"" isn't a race; it's a historical ethno-linguistic group.  Blacks were an extremely small minority in Rome, and nearly all were imported as slaves.  ""Middle Easterners"" is simply an ignorant term that refers a number of ethno-linguistic groups from a geographic area, and not a ""race.""  The vast majority of Roman society was comprised of ~White, Mediterranean peoples.  They had cultural difference, but were all the same race, per modern opinion.  

&gt; London stretching back to the 9th century has had a plethora of different races.

Just plain false.  You'd be looking for a racial minority population &lt;1%.  You're talking about the historical period dating back to the ""dark ages.""  There was little or no immigration/migration between the British Isles and the mainland for at least ~5-6 centuries after the arbitrary date you just set.  

&gt;A microcosm means, to paraphrase, a scale representation of society or a community as a whole.  The lack of blacks, mexicans, asians, and any other kind of minorities makes burning man representative of, at best, urban communities in the wealthy hillcountry. 

You're insinuating that Burning Man has to represent the demographics of American society as a whole, in order to be a viable microcosm.  This is just a false assertion that has nothing to do with the definition of ""microcosm"" you just stated.  By definition, the people attending BM are a subset of the culture who wants to go.  They are, by definition, a microcosm.  

&gt;But that's not what he said. He said it was representative of all society, which is fucking dumb, because it's not, because they're all well off and white.

It is and isn't representative of all of society.  I saw Elon Musk at BM last year, and also spoke to plenty of people who saved up all year in order to go.  I think you're getting a little held up on terminology.  Sure, some minorities are under-represented, but you took it one step further when you said that a viable microcosm needed to accurately reflect the demographics of American society as a whole.  

Its racial make-up has no bearing on whether or not it a microcosm reflects a subset of a viable culture or society.  A microcosm does not need to have 6% Asians, 13% Blacks, etc.  That is a false assertion.  Even if OP was wrong, too.

False,t5_2ys9x,0,"Those both seem like extraordinary claims. It doesn't seem to be the case (although I can't cite any studies here) that working-class people are ""overwhelmingly right-wing,"" and certainly most socialists are not rich/educated/white, since working-class (not-rich, and likely less-educated in many cases) people are indeed a main focus of socialist concerns.

It doesn't take too broad of a survey of history to see that rich white people haven't exactly been the primary frontier of socialist movements and thought. However, we might note that there is a bit of a bias here (in terms of racial composition), since although European regions had old regimes and peasantry often well into the 20^th century, European regions at the same time were first exposed to proletarianizing influences (however strong) and were as such not as entrenched in pre- or non- capitalist modes of production as other (now poorer) regions of the world. So we would expect to see more white people in the history for this reason.

Regardless, it still might seem puzzling that some working-class people *are* in fact right-wing in many of their beliefs. Part of this is often explained by superstructural concerns (cultural hegemony, &amp;c.), but

&gt;However, the [worker's] movement faced internal limits as well: only a portion of the proletariat ever identified with the programme of the workers’ movement. That was because many proletarians affirmed their non-class identities — organised primarily around race and nation, but secondarily around gender, skill and trade — above their class identity.

[...]

&gt;Such segregation may appear inefficient, for employers, since it restricts the pool of potential workers for any given post. But as long as the relevant populations are large enough, employers are able to segment the labour market and drive down wages.

- Endnotes 4: *History of Separation*, Part III (2015)

&gt;This is especially true for proletarians, whose very survival depends on competing with other proletarians, and who therefore face the most barriers to collective organisation (as we have argued elsewhere, it is not the eventual decline of working class identity, but rather its emergence despite these barriers, which needs to be explained). 

- Endnotes 4: *History of Separation*, Afterword (2015)

--

In addition, to attempt to answer why some people might think that socialists are rich white folks:

&gt;[Worker's] organisation requires an affirmable identity, an image of working class respectability and dignity.

[...]

&gt;Yet the predicates of the dignified worker (male, disciplined, atheist, expressing a thirst for scientific knowledge and political education, etc.) were often drawn by analogy to the values of bourgeois society.

- Endnotes 4: *History of Separation*, Part III (2015)

Some more relevant quotes if you like:

&gt;""[W]orkers are not only collective producers with a common interest in taking collective control over social production. They are also individual sellers of labor power in conflict with each other over jobs, promotions, etc."" As Kim Moody put it, capitalism ""pushes together and pulls apart"" the working class. As competing sellers of labor power, workers are open to the appeal of politics that pit them against other workers - especially workers in a weaker social position

[...]

&gt;...when reformism proves incapable of realistically defending workers' interests - as it has since the early 1970s - workers embrace individualist and sectoralist perspectives as the only realistic strategy.

False,t5_2qh13,0,"THERE IS NO FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR ON MAINLAND EUROPE AND NEVER WILL BE.

Hollande Junker and his EU cronies are a bunch of hypocritical frauds.  They have engineered this situation over a number of years.  They have refused to discuss ""free movement of labour""  knowing fullwell the UK would eventually not take anymore.  Free movement of labour was the key issue and they have self-rightiously stood there and said the UK must accept this even if it destabalised the country.
  
They have done this smug in the knowledge that free movement of labour only applies to the UK.  It's only a theory in France, Italy, Spain Poland etc.  It can never be a reality.
It's allowed but it's miniscule in extent.  Germany was being depopulated until desparate Syrians appeared.

The European policy is fatally flawed because it is absolutely the case that it requires a common language, the only common language is English.  People only move when the English language facilitates it.  This is because English is by far the easiest language in Europe to get to a functional level.  With not even the full Basic English vocabulary you can be up and running in weeks.  Six to eight hundred words and a smattering of grammar, plus English speakers are tollerant of mistakes, understand Yoda we do.  Try that with French or German. Ain't happening. 

For the UK it's had great benefits but at the cost of a failing NHS which has had an effective 10% cut as a result, overflowing schools and rocketing house prices as millions have arrived with the prospect of millions more in the next 10 years.  You can't have a policy like this that is only a reality for a small part of Europe.  It hasn't helped that at the same time the main part of Europe has turned into an economic death zone as France, Italy, Spain, Portugal  and Belgium slowly go broke.

So there they sit bleating ""free movement""  knowing it's meaningless to them except as a tool to get rid of English.  If they were commited to this they'd have to accept a common language ... English.  I can hear Hollande spitting out his fois gras at that. French is a quaint language but it's stupidly difficult.

TLDR. Free movement of labour needs a common language. Hollande etc. know this so it's a half baked policy, they couldn't accept a proper free movement of labour policy and are happy to see the UK be destabilised as millions of people flood one country.  They wanted this all along. If they agree to give up national languages and all speak English it can happen.

I'm sorry, but the blame for this does not lie solely with 'the left'. All sides of politics have, for the past 30 or 40 years, closed their eyes to these issues. Problems around globalisation and migration aren't just something that cropped up yesterday. The current 'refugee crisis' in Europe has been at least 20 years in the making, and both governments from the left and right all over Europe didn't give a shit until it was too late. Globalisation is driven by the economic right as much if not more as it is driven by the left. 

If you accuse the left of ignoring these issues and demonising the right, then you have to also accuse the right of presenting the wrong solutions and demonising the left., because that's exactly what's happening. If there's anything the current nationalist movements are completely and utterly incapable of (and have always been), it's rational debate. They don't have solutions, only populism.

&gt; A much better way than screaming how racist Brexit is and how everyone who supported it is evil, is to give tangible coherent solutions to the issues that caused the Brexit vote to happen in the very first place.

The Leave campaign was partially built on racism and xenophobia, only for its leaders to immediately admit that some of their arguments were fallacies and lies. That has to be called out. You think the reason Britain is in the state it's in is the fault of the left? I'd beg to differ. There is no single side that is to blame for all of it, the blame is shared equally. For generations, politicians of all colours have abused power, broken promises, lied to their voters and been outright corrupt. Political debate is dead. You want solutions? Those who want to present them, are immediately shouted down and screamed over by their opponents, no matter how sensible their suggestions may be. In the world we live in, before you can actually present and work on solutions for the deep trouble the planet is in, there's a lot more to fix than just 'the left'.

False,t5_39usd,0,"IF THE rest of the world were allowed to vote in American presidential elections, on current numbers Donald Trump would be facing a 50-state landslide loss. A [survey of global attitudes](http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/06/29/as-obama-years-draw-to-close-president-and-u-s-seen-favorably-in-europe-and-asia/) towards America released on June 29th by the Pew Research Centre shows a derisory 9% of foreign respondents expressing confidence in the presumptive Republican nominee’s ability to handle foreign affairs. Some 85% are actively sceptical.

Some may argue that such worldwide polling is not that significant. For one thing, if the world had a vote, Barack Obama would probably be heading for a third term—he enjoys 77% confidence in the new Pew poll, outstripping his would-be Democratic successor, Hillary Clinton, whose number stands at 59%. That is not where the mood is in America, where Mr Obama’s overall approval ratings are ticking up a bit at the moment, but remain bad on foreign policy and on keeping an anxious public safe from Islamic terrorism and other threats.

As a broader point, foreigners tend to like American presidents who seem willing to take their interests into account—and much of Mr Trump’s success in the Republican primaries is based on declarations that he will put America first. It is also the case that foreigners often misunderstand American leaders, caricaturing their views or reducing them to cartoonish heroes or villains.

But global attitudes are not irrelevant. Even the most brilliant deal-maker in the world needs someone on the other side of the table with whom to shake hands and agree. Though Trumpian threats and swagger sometimes work, America may need foreigners to offer their consent willingly, not least when those same foreigners are being asked to endure some political or financial pain, or risk a backlash from their own publics. And—to use Trump language—the price of doing business with others rises if America’s leader is seen as a thug.

So should the Pew poll offer one more reason for Americans, and especially thoughtful Republicans, to fear their nominee as a disaster waiting to happen? Lexington was asked to speak at the [launch of the Pew survey](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/events/webcasts/america-s-role-in-the-world-how-others-view-us) at the Atlantic Council, a think-tank, and based on nearly 20 years of reporting as a foreign correspondent, seven of them in Washington, DC, but the rest observing America from abroad, I said yes.

To simplify, foreign views of America are shaped by a a couple of big things. First, America is (still) the most powerful country on earth. That makes adversaries seethe, promotes conspiracy theories and obliges even allies to swallow their pride and rationalise their relative impotence. Second, America traditionally claims to be a force for good. Thus when America does act, foreigners do not merely have to decide whether they approve or disapprove. They must also weigh whether they think America is being hypocritical.

And here is a sign of trouble for Mr Trump. For when I watched the presidency of George W. Bush from successive postings in Beijing, Washington, DC and Brussels, I heard foreign critics levelling the following charges against him. To sketch out the caricature, Mr Bush was called a hypocritical, proudly ignorant, America-first, unilateralist bully pursuing a sectarian crusade against the Muslim world. His claims to be invading the Middle East to help liberate the Iraqi people and promote democracy were scorned, as European politicians and placard-wielding protestors alike asserted that he was bent on selfishly grabbing Arab oil. His willingness to use torture on terrorist suspects was not seen as a reluctant act of self-defence. Instead many in Europe, certainly, saw the revelations about enhanced interrogations and secret prisons as proof that America is a violent renegade power. When Mr Bush expressed sorrow about the collateral killing of innocent civilians during the war on terror, he was called a lying war criminal. The list could go on.

Here is the thing: many items on that charge-list against Mr Bush were either unfair or exaggerated. Yet every one of those Bush-era charges is one of Mr Trump’s boasts. To the extent that the property developer should be taken at face value, he tells supporters that he is an America-first unilateralist willing to ban Muslims from entry into the country because there is so much “incredible hate” in the Muslim world, and so many Muslims are “bad people”—even if he has recently sought to finesse that sectarian ban into a policy of excluding arrivals from terrorist-blighted countries.

Mr Trump derides the idea of nation-building overseas and explicitly says that America should “bomb the shit” out of enemies in the Middle East and grab their oil, spending the proceeds on American military veterans and their families. He brags that he would reintroduce waterboarding and worse, sometimes tells rallies that even if torture does not work it is in any case what terrorists deserve. As for collateral casualties, he is proud to say that he would target the families of terrorists—a war crime. In short, the caricature of America that so much of the world hated from 2001 to 2008 is Mr Trump’s pitch.

A brief thought on Mrs Clinton’s numbers. Pew uncovered an interesting generation gap, with older respondents in Europe and Asia more likely to have confidence in her foreign policy, by double-digit margins. My hunch is that this is more a name-recognition effect than a detailed assessment of her record as secretary of state or her foreign policy platform. The public in some countries, such as Israel, probably do have firm views about Mrs Clinton as a foreign policy actor, because she loomed large in their own domestic news as America’s top diplomat. But if people in much of the world know one single thing about Mrs Clinton, it is that she is the wife of a former president, Bill Clinton. And that simply means more to those older people overseas who remember Mr Clinton in office.

A final observation from the Pew survey. One chart sets out foreign views of a range of political leaders, and it is striking how often the numbers for Mrs Clinton and President Vladimir Putin nearly mirror each other, so that 30% confidence in Mr Putin, say, goes hand in hand with 70% confidence in Mrs Clinton, and vice-versa. That makes sense. On a whole range of issues, from expressing concern about climate change to gay rights, Mrs Clinton could be called the anti-Putin.

The Brexit panic is already over. Could a “brexpansion” be in the works?

Global financial markets were caught off guard by Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and initially reacted by bidding down risky assets, while bidding up safer assets—including, ironically, debt issued by the U.K. government.

The sell-off in U.K. stocks, however, began to reverse itself on Tuesday—just two trading days after the Brexit vote. Even shares of British real-estate companies and British banks, sectors many expect to be hard hit by a post-Brexit downturn, rose on Tuesday and Wednesday. Shares of Great Portland Estates are up 12.6% over the past two trading sessions, while shares of Lloyds Banking Group rose 8.1%.

Part of the reason the sell-off may be more shorter and less drastic than some of the more dire forecasters predict is that the much dreaded “uncertainty” might not be a drag on the British economy.  It may actually have the opposite effect—boosting business investment, consumer confidence and economic growth.

That’s certainly not the view of most market watchers right now. Many expect a slowdown or even outright economic contraction in the near term, as businesses and consumers anticipate less economic growth amid uncertainty about Britain’s access to global markets outside of the European Union. The Economist Intelligence Unit has revised down its expectations for the U.K.’s gross domestic product next to a meager 1%.

Keep in mind that no immediate shifts in Britain’s economy follow from Brexit.  It will likely remain in the European Union for years, and in the meantime  it will continue to enjoy access to the European market. Despite many predictions that the borrowing costs of the British government would rise, yields on U.K. gilts have fallen since the vote. All other things being equal, falling interest rates should be economically stimulative.

Yet many are convinced that the economy could be dragged down by uncertainty itself. This idea was put forth in a 1975 paper by then graduate student Ben Bernanke. The young Mr. Bernanke argued that when businesses face uncertainty, they tend to hold off on investment spending and hiring until they receive more information.  Since then, a large body of economic research has supported the negative link between uncertainty and investment.

There is evidence, however, that in highly competitive environments uncertainty increases investment and economic output. That’s because businesses in competitive industries or economies can’t always afford to wait for more information when waiting risks allowing rivals to capture investment opportunities or hire the best workers.  Several recent economic papers have shown this expansionary uncertainty in various markets.

A new paper by Raja Patnaik, a PhD candidate in finance at the London Business School, looked at how U.S. companies reacted to unpredictable weather around El Nino cycles. Mr. Patnaik found that in highly competitive industries businesses, on average, increase spending in the face of higher uncertainty.  This is true particularly when businesses  have a high degree of operational flexibility—that is, the ability to lay off workers in the event that demand collapses—and for more labor intensive businesses.

Imagine that weather forecasters are in conflict about what the future holds. Some say a blizzard will hit your town, others say the storm will pass to your north. If you run a shop that sells snow shovels, you have the choice to order more from the town’s shovel factory now or wait until you get more certainty about the weather. If you are the only shop in town selling shovels, you can afford to wait. If there are several other shovel shops, however, by holding off you risk having to stock up during a potential run on shovels. So you have an incentive to buy now. That’s expansionary uncertainty at work.

The kind of effects Mr. Bernanke found are confined to highly concentrated businesses where competition is minimal, according to Mr. Patnaik and others who have studied this.  In these spending on R&amp;D, advertising and hiring drops off in the face of uncertainty, while uncertainty has no effect on these in competitive industries. In other areas, such as hiring workers, businesses in competitive environments step up hiring.

The British economy is, overall, a very competitive place—especially compared with some of its European neighbors with far less flexible labor markets.  From construction to computer science, the U.K. has a number of industries that are highly competitive and not dominated by big players, according to government studies.  Studies on uncertainty in competitive environments suggest that it’s likely that many of these will not take a wait and see attitude toward the post-Brexit world but instead invest and hire in order to take advantage of opportunities that may arise when Britain is no longer shackled to Europe.

One exception to this is banking. The British banking sector is so highly concentrated that many would describe it as an oligopoly. Perhaps international competition will mediate this somewhat but with so many European banks also struggling, this effect may be muted. Uncertainty, then may very well lead to British banks deciding to batten down the hatches—just as Mr. Bernanke described. Small wonder that so many London residents opposed Brexit.

Uncertainty is the watchword of the day, to be sure. But it may result in far more growth in Britain than pessimists expect thanks to the competitiveness of the British economy.

False,t5_2qhqb,0,"&gt; First, in most jurisdictions major constitutional change requires a supermajority or two-thirds majority to effect them

The only referendum where the UK has used anything other than a straight majority was the infamous ""40% rule"" in the [1979 Scottish Devolution referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_devolution_referendum,_1979#Scotland_Act_1978).

So whatever they do in ""most jurisdictions"" it does not appear to be what we do here in the UK.

&gt; Second, a referendum is in essence a decision by crowd acclamation. You will of course well understand that there is an excellent reason why most advanced and mature polities do not have systems of ‘direct democracy’ but instead have systems of representative democracy, in which legislators are not delegates sent by their constituents but agents tasked and empowered to investigate, debate and decide on behalf of their constituents. This reason is that rule by crowd acclamation is a very poor method of government.
&gt;
&gt; Consider: suppose that every item of proposed legislation were decided by referendums, which would therefore occur very frequently.

That is not a [strong argument](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/30/Appeal_to_Extremes). That a referendum is a bad tool for determining when Professor Grayling needs to fill up his car does not make it a bad tool for every decision Professor Grayling needs to make in his life.

&gt; Referendums are snapshots of sentiment at a given point in time. Government by referendum is government by crowd acclamation: not democracy, but ochlocracy. That is exactly why we have representative democracy.

Representative democracy is also a snapshot of a sentiment at a given point in time. And while ""daily government by referendum"" might be a bad idea, it doesn't follow that ""significant and infrequent decisions by referendum"" are.

&gt; If referendums would be a poor way to decide on health and safety, air traffic control, or education, they are an exceedingly poor way to decide a matter as momentous as membership of the EU.

One could ask if there is anything a referendum would be a good way to decide on?

&gt; Moreover: the circumstances of the campaigns and the consequences of the vote itself must be considered. There was a great deal of misinformation, distortion, and false promises, much of it quickly revealed in the immediate aftermath of the vote, and resiled upon even by those who had made those claims and promises. Tabloid urgings for Brexit were followed, in the very same tabloids, immediately after the vote by information on its consequences which shocked readers. We have seen much reported about the post-vote regrets of people who had voted for ‘Brexit,’ – including some high-profile individuals who before the vote had been urging it in their newspapers.

This is, unfortunately, one of the worst things about this referendum. Yes, some information was either deliberately false or constructed in such a way as to be misleading.

However you saw exactly the same during the Scottish independence referendum and you see exactly the same at a General Election. Since 1945 around [20% of election promises are routinely broken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_promise#Broken_promises) (this study was mostly in the US but there's absolutely no reason to think other western democracies are immune).

For example [Gordon Brown, in 2014](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/gordon-brown-backs-federalism-in-event-of-no-vote-1-3511291), said ""We’re going to be, within a year or two, as close to a federal state as you can be in a country where one nation is 85 per cent of the population"". Are we now, two years, on, as close to a federal state as we can be?

Ed Davey (energy secretary) claimed that a carbon capture plant at Peterhead would be at risk after a Yes vote and secure after No. One year later the UK [cancelled a £1bn grant](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-34357804) and closed it.

George Osborne claimed that corporation tax couldn't be devolved or it would create a ""race to the bottom"". After the referendum he promptly devolved it to Northern Ireland.

There are dozens of similar examples and I'm sure you can find equivalents on the Yes side. Yet, despite these, nobody called for the 2014 result to be disregarded.

&gt; There is a formal online petition requesting a second referendum. If this petition is genuine and not the result of fraudulent computer hacking, it is the most extraordinary phenomenon: as I write these words it stands, only a few days after the vote itself, at over four million signatures.

The petition is not genuine. [4chan bots](https://heatst.com/uk/exclusive-brexit-2nd-referendum-petition-a-4-chan-prank-bbc-report-it-as-real/) randomly populated it with plausible names and UK postcodes, as well as the obviously spurious results like Vatican City.

One million people marched through London in 15th February 2003 to protest the Iraq war. London voted heavily for Remain, yet one million people are not marching in protest over this.

&gt; You might think that Parliament’s discretion not to trigger the Article 50 procedure would leave matters hanging in the air, with continued uncertainty and the instability and political upheaval that it would bring.
&gt;
&gt;Not so.

Absolutely so. The rest of the EU are absolutely furious that we have managed to create an utter catastrofuck out of thin air.

Every EU country is now waiting for the other shoe to drop, knowing that if this referendum is disregarded by Parliament then the 2020 election is likely to become a rematch.

By the time 52% of the country are voting for something you can happily let 5% change their mind (and for the sake of argument let's unrealistically assume that 0% go the other way) and you *still* have a higher percentage that voted for Scottish independence - something that most people now see as inevitable.

Nullifying this referendum will result in this becoming the theme of UK politics throughout the 2020s. The working assumption across the EU is that it's now a matter of *when* not *if*.

Cameron has bought us a little breathing space until a new PM is selected. In theory A50 is entirely under our control, in practice we are about to come under sustained pressure from the rest of the EU to activate it. It is manifestly in their self-interest that this be resolved sooner rather than later to remove the uncertainty we have just conjured up.

&gt; The EU is flawed and has problems. But as a powerful member of one of the three great blocs in the world, the UK can do much to help it get better, and to work within it to help all its members realize the great ideals of peace, prosperity and co-operation for which the EU exists.

I absolutely agree, which is why I voted Remain.

But the referendum campaign ran for several months, the vote was well run and fairly conducted, and we have absolutely no reason to believe the final tally was fraudulent.

Disregarding a plebiscite due to concerns over the *result*, rather than concerns over the *process*, is the very definition of undemocratic.

If there was any reason to think voters were coerced on the day, or that ballot boxes were tampered with, then, yes, a re-vote might be justifiable. There is nothing to support either of those scenarios.

I am supremely disappointed in this result, and I do think the UK will be worse off as a result. But the result is the result.

That my vote didn't align with the rest of the country is painful, and I felt exactly the same in 2014. But the result is the result.

Consider this:

* We run the vote again and it's 52% Leave. Do we run it again?
* We run the vote again and it's 52% Remain. Should an eloquent letter from a pro-Leave figure be able to convince Parliament to disregard it?

If you allow governments to disregard the result of a vote then you are closing the door on democracy. Should the Conservatives be allowed to disregard a narrow victory for Labour in 2020 ""for the good of the country""? Should Labour?

That argument has been made before and it never ends well. At some point the shoe is on the other foot and ""your side"" is the one being railroaded.

The painful lesson in Scotland from 2014 was that Yes failed because it didn't convince enough people. If you want to succeed next time then you need to understand who you didn't convince, and why.

If you don't like the result then you need to decide what you do want. Full EU status again?

So for what I see, what looks [like the new posture on travel restrictions](http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-back-pedals-on-banning-muslims-from-u-s-1467058774) would be just a slight enforcement on what's already in place, which as I said in other comments would not have much effect: there are also safe countries with terrorists (see EU, and inside the US) and actually most (IIRC, all of them but I'm not sure) of the terrorists attacks in Europe and US have been perpretrated by EU or US-born terrorists.

&gt; I think his Nazi analogy is apt and demonstrates how Islam ideology knows only one gear and the further you move away from its dogma, the closer you get to 21st century western values and and compatibility to NA and EU civilization.

So in this example, the Nazi party is being compared to Islam. Nazism is the government of a country of less than 70,000,000 people. There are over 1,600,000,000 Muslims in the world. That means there are almost 23 times as many Muslims (spread in a much more geographically diverse way) than there were Nazis. And the Nazi party existed for barely a decade, whereas the Islamic faith dates back some 1400 years.

So we're already off to a very, very shaky start. A very shaky start. How can you even begin to compare these two things? Oftentimes when people are trying to compare something to Nazi Germany, they are stretching to find the worst, most abhorrent comparison possible without any thought for intellectual suicide in the process.

What am I supposed to think about a person talking about a very heated, relevant topic in global politics in today's world when they're stretching so hard to draw this kind of comparison?

Also, we didn't have trouble labeling Nazi Germany as an enemy because **Germany is a country**. This is another leading blunder that so many on the right (and Sam Harris) can't seem to understand.

""We need to label the enemy as Islamic extremism, then we can begin to fight them!""

What do you mean, ""begin to fight them""? Is there a country on the map called ""Islamoterrosimistan""? Is there some place we can march an army up to ""defeat terrorism""? All of these concepts are childish and show a severe naivety when it comes to understanding global politics. It's doubly insulting because [we have fired off so many bombs against ISIS and in record numbers that we are literally running out of them](http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/04/politics/air-force-20000-bombs-missiles-isis/). What is the implication here, that the US just ""hasn't done anything against ISIS?""

False,t5_2sfmf,0,"Thanks. I agree; it shouldn't be like this but this is how most doctors work. There really isn't a good way to ensure doctors know everything, aside from forcing them to go home and spend hours getting caught up on the literature. They're people like you and me and have lives.

As for your comment re: Dr. Novella, no doctor prescribes medicine he doesn't know first-hand and/or have researched. That's incredibly irresponsible as there are lots of things doctors need to know about: drug-drug interactions, food-drug interactions, recommended dosage, side effects, etc. The pamphlets pharma reps hand out are not replacements for that process; it's more to make doctors aware of new drugs and then for docs to look into. Plus they also offer free drug samples for docs to try out/answer questions in person.

You argued docs should prescribe drugs based on efficacy. However, that's only one of many reasons why specific drugs are prescribed. Here's two case studies. One is a patient with Hepatitis C. He could get Sovaldi and pay out 100,000 for 3 months of medication and have a 93% cure rate, or pay significantly less for one that has a 80% cure rate. Moreover, Sovaldi might not even be covered by his insurance plan, so the doc might lean towards using the older medicine. Another is tradition. If you have the Merck Manual, just open it up and you see many possible treatments for each disease. Which does the doctor prescribe? Usually it's based on what the doctor trusts/has previously used. 

Side note: combination pills are actually very useful. Some of the combo pills exist to reduce side effects. Strong opiates cause diarrhea and stomach cramps because it affects the nerves in the digestive track, so it is now often combined with an anti-diarrheal agent. In the past it used to be given separately, but people complained mainly because they weren't taking their medication properly. Also, medication compliance decreases dramatically as number of pills increase esp among older people. There are entire companies built around the idea of polypills - in Europe, there's a drug that combines a statin, beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor, which is commonly prescribed separately in the US to patients after having heart attacks.

&gt; Deep down, I think this explains why so many people in the United States and in Europe are desperate to keep Uncle Sam fully engaged in Europe. It’s not so much the fear of a declining but assertive Russia; it’s their fear of Europe itself. Liberals want Europe to remain peaceful, tolerant, democratic and embedded within the EU framework, and they’d like to pull countries like Georgia or Ukraine more fully into Europe’s democratic circle eventually. But deep down, they just don’t trust the Europeans to manage this situation, and they fear it will all go south if the “American pacifier” is removed. For all of liberalism’s supposed virtues, at the end of the day its defenders cannot shake the suspicion that its European version is so delicate that it requires indefinite American support. Who knows? Maybe they’re right. But unless you think the United States has infinite resources and a limitless willingness to subsidize other wealthy states’ defenses, then the question is: what other global priorities are liberals prepared to sacrifice in order to preserve what’s left of the European order?

　私は内心、思う。欧米にアメリカ政府の欧州への関与を必死でつなぎ止めようとする人が非常に多いのはこのためではないか。強硬なロシアが怖いというより、ヨーロッパ自身を恐れているのではないか。自由主義者の願いは、平和で寛容で民主的なヨーロッパがEUの枠に収まっていてくれることだ。最終的には、旧ソ連のジョージア（グルジアから呼称を変更）やウクライナもヨーロッパの民主主義圏に引き込みたいと夢見ている。

　同時に彼らはヨーロッパに今の状況を収拾できるとは思っておらず、アメリカという安定剤がなくなればすべてが瓦解すると思っている。ヨーロッパ版の自由な社会は繊細過ぎて、永遠にアメリカから乳離れできないと。

　彼らが正しいのかもしれない。だがアメリカの資源は無限ではないし、永遠に裕福な国々の防衛を支援することなどあり得ない。だとすれば、ヨーロッパにかろうじて残った自由な秩序を守り続けるには世界のどこか別の場所を犠牲にしなければならない。自由主義者にその用意はあるのだろうか。

&gt;* The Canadian soldiers will be part of a 4,000-strong NATO force that will be deployed to the Baltic States and Poland in order to deter what is claimed to be Russian threats.

&gt;* NATO plans to expand its military presence in Eastern Europe amid the conflict in Ukraine and has held numerous war games recently.

&gt;* NATO has stepped up its military build-up near Russia's borders since it suspended all ties with Moscow in April 2014 after the Black Sea Crimean Peninsula re-integrated into the Russian Federation following a referendum.

False,t5_2qh4r,0,"There is a longer history.

During the 1930s, Japan supplied 90% of hard drugs world wide. They had a puppet state in China to produce opiates, where they controlled society by having everyone addicted.

To combat the communists in WW2 we made deals with Meyer Lansky in New York and the Corsican mob. They were to guard the ports against communsits and the US turned a blind eye to heroin shipments. Think French Connection.

This also brings us to Vietnam and the rest of the Golden Triangle, where Opium was produced and we fought a very unpopular war to keep the heroin flowing.

Turkey in the late 1960s was famous as a narco-state and a opium transport hub. It would then go to Marseille to be produced into heroin. Again the French Connection. We made a deal with Turkey to allow them to move away from a narco-economy. We lost Vietnam. We took down the French Connection.

The Golden Triangle moved to the Golden Crescent, around Afghanistan and Pakistan.

There was also a fair amount of issues with Cocaine and South America. During the crack epidemic of the 1980s, there were two main suppliers of cocaine in America. In California, Right wing Nicaraguans selling Cocaine to fund a civil war against a left wing government back home (see Iran-Contra). In Florida, Left Wing Jamaicans selling Cocaine to fund a ivil war against right wingers back home.

Seeing the shift to the Golden Crescent, we ramped up Oxycontin in the states. Starting a silent addiction through doctors.

The Taliban basically shuts down Opium production (or possibly just export in order to drive up prices.) We invade and take that over. Most of that goes to Russia, Europe, and to Iran (usually as Opium via Baluchistan due to regional preferences). Excellent for destabilizing regimes, making money for black ops, and just fixing trade imbalances in general.

With Afghansitan under control we shutdown oxycontin. Afghan stuff goes to the regions mentioned before. We give Mexican cartels the opportunity to make a ton of money supplying heroin, and also put the state in trouble. NAFTA allows for easy transport of these drugs, but it's also the reason we need to damage their economy by creating this narco war there.

Mexican heroin is black tar (though they are experimenting with better stuff these days), and that goes to the west coast. Being visibly different, it's very easy to allow for people to watch at a high level and make sure the gangs stay to their turf.

Then there is the east coast and chicago as your other main hubs: East Coast Powder, China White. This comes in usually from Asian gangs via canada and south american gangs via east coast ports. I think a lot of that has to do with fixing trade imbalances with China. I think we are trying to shut out the south americans to some degree, but they still have cocaine on lock down.

There's a lot more to it, but drugs are bit and a big part of history.

False,t5_2ssp3,0,"**Part III: The Thorniness of Continuity** 

One of the paradoxes of modern German history is that despite these lines of continuity, Germany evolved into a state that is very much the antithesis of illiberal Third Reich. Calls for a restoration of the old order swiftly became consigned to the margins of FRG society and the far right parties like the FRP seldom managed to become a major political force within FRG politics. The Bundeswehr's de facto embrace of the Clean Wehrmacht myth did not prevent embarrassments like the 1976 ""Rudel Affair"" in which Luftwaffe Generals praised the veteran and SRP figure Hans-Ulrich Rudel during his visit to Bremgarten Air Force Base, but the FRG military did respond with an internal house-cleaning in light of the bad press. Even in the GDR, popular protests against the regime were not so much ideologically-based, but rather predicated on the inability of the SED to provide resources and necessities to the wider public.

The rising prosperity and standard of living certainly helped buy the FRG a legitimacy that its predecessor had desperately sought, but never achieved. The Third Reich often promised Germans that shortages and sacrifices were temporary necessities for them to achieve the good life of material comfort and high-quality goods. But the promises of cars, refrigerators, and electronics often went unfulfilled. In contrast, the export-fueled economic boom gave West Germans unprecedented access to these material comforts. Motorization and automobile ownership soared in the decade after the establishment of the FRG; there were 821000 registered vehicles in 1952 to 6.6 million in 1963. Although sales of the VW Beetle skewed heavily to the middle class until the mid-1960s, private-car ownership was increasingly becoming the norm in the FRG rather than the exception and the Beetle became an icon of FRG's economic recovery. This prosperity helped buy legitimacy for both democracy and the Bonn government. 

But prosperity was not the only factor that reinforced the postwar status quo. The political culture and structures of the state simultaneously discouraged any resurrection of the old regime. For all of their faults, the military governments were quite mindful of vetting the leadership when licensing the postwar political parties, many of whom had connections to the Weimar political parties. While the mixed electoral system of the FRG channels politics down somewhat boring consensus politics, especially in the post-*Wende* milieu, the 5% threshold for representation has proven to be a useful firewall against illiberal parties on the far right. Not only does the threshold hold these parties back, it provides a useful barometer both at home and abroad about the status of German neo-nazism. When the FRP managed to accrue approximately 10% of the votes in local elections in Lower Saxony and Bremen in 1952,the American and FRG press was quite alarmed and helped kickstart the process that saw the SRP banned as a political party inimical to Basic Law. 

This makes the issue of continuity in programs and practices quite difficult to parse out and analyze as their use inside postwar Germany is under very different circumstances. For example, one Third Reich-era law still on the books in 2008 forbids any the use of the title ""Doktor"" on official correspondence like business cards unless the individual earned it from a German institution. Within the context of the Third Reich, such a law reflected chauvinist precepts that asserted German intellectual superiority over other nations, but in 2008, enforcing these laws have a different meaning, reflecting legal inertia and  the somewhat silly cultural attitude some Germans have towards titles. The criminal investigation of several US researchers for title abuse in 2008 prompted a number of critiques in the German media and government about this silly law, something that would have been quite unlikely in the climate of 1933-45. 

Environmentalism in the Third Reich and FRG provides a useful contrast between the two contexts and illustrates that issues of continuity are seldom really straight forward.  The Third Reich passed *Reichsnaturschutzgesetz* in 1935 which provided for environmental protections in relations to economic development. The RNG proved the basis for a number of other laws for the protection of the environment and the basis for visions of a ""greening"" of the newly-captured Eastern territories. But the state proved to be at best a reluctant partner in environmental protection and the RNG's provisions were seldom enforced. The Third Reich seemed more interested in prosecution of violations of laws in animal welfare when it connected up antisemitic principles such as the closure of kosher butchers. German environmental activists found that they gained more traction when they could align their work with racialist ideas. Therefore, landscape planners like Hans Klose (one of the authors of the RNG)  and started to conceptualize erosion and other aspects environmental degradation as racial problem created by a Slavic ""steppe-culture"" or Jewish rapacity. The lush, verdant landscapes imagined by the architects of *Generalplan Ost* were presented as a restoration of the land to its original Germanic character. Environmental protection merged with a type of environmental imperialism that projected a purportedly Germanic environmental landscape across the steppes of Eastern Europe. 

Although Klose and his landscape planning compatriots in *Generalplan Ost* largely came through denazification unscathed and resumed positions within the FRG universities, they had little direct connection to the postwar environmentalist movement in the FRG. This movement, which coalesced into the Greens, evolved out a different social milieu of the student activism of the 1960s, the antinuclear movement, and the global counterculture. While the authors of the RNG came from strongholds of the conservative Germans establishment such as research institutes and universities, the Greens emerged out of a largely anti-establishment climate like the West Berlin communes and was influenced by international ideas like Carson's *Silent Spring*. Additionally, the Greens also pushed a holistic vision of nature that is fundamentally at odds with the Nazi's view of nature that stressed it was a resource for the consumption of a privileged racial elite. Although the RNG had largely been superseded by federal law, its precedent provided a gateway for Green-inspired legislation once they were able to break the 5% threshold regularly in national elections. 

One of the issues that clouds the issue of the persistence or survival of National Socialist programs or mentalities postwar is that the reality of the Third Reich never matched its image of a well-oiled totalitarian machine ubiquitous in its propaganda. This allowed German postwar to portray Nazi innovations or developments as something that was separate from the regime because in many cases they did evolve without significant state interference. But this did not mean they were completely devoid of National Socialist concepts or ideology.  The failures of denazification efforts meant that there were intact social networks that allowed for cohorts like career diplomats or German professors to resume their professional careers despite significant evidence of their collusion with the Third Reich. However the state structures in the FRG and even the GDR were decidedly different milieus than the Third Reich and made resuscitation of the old order quite difficult, and the remnants tended to either transform or atrophy in this new climate.

They can, but it's impossible to know which ideas will be left behind and which will not.

&gt; Blanket bans are based not only on assumptions the person will bring that idea into that space, but in my experience are often based on misconceptions about the ideas themselves.

It has less to do with assumptions about what the person and more with lacking the resources to discern individual motivations apart.

They may disagree, as is their right, but if I could be barred from any community at any time because of a few people's assumptions, I'd like to know.

It'll take almost that long for the Party Leadership contests to happen, and there'll be a need for plenty of grandstanding from the Conservatives and Labour to try and cling to their anti-immigrant base without fucking the economy.

If the Conservative leader is smart about it, they'll say that under no circumstances will they accept free movement of people, then after 2+ years of economic uncertainty and tedious negotiations will come back with a hard won deal that limits immigration in a completely meaningless way that the EU are fine with.

&gt;If the EU decides to go hardball on the UK, that would do a LOT more damage than giving the UK a firm but fair deal.

No one in the EU seems to think so and its their job to be good at this kind of thing. They think that forcing the UK to choose either between free movement or a shit deal is the best way of disempowering nationalist separatists. They have no political incentive to be wrong about this.

&gt;Trying to 'punish' the UK feeds right into the right-wing narrative that the Brussels administration is no better than a Soviet strongman

&gt;This year is the 150th anniversary of Jack Daniel’s, and the distillery, home to one of the world’s best-selling whiskeys, is using the occasion to tell a different, more complicated tale. Daniel, the company now says, didn’t learn distilling from Dan Call, but from a man named Nearis Green — one of Call’s slaves.

&gt;This version of the story was never a secret, but it is one that the distillery has only recently begun to embrace, tentatively, in some of its tours, and in a social media and marketing campaign this summer.

&gt;“It’s taken something like the anniversary for us to start to talk about ourselves,” said Nelson Eddy, Jack Daniel’s in-house historian.

&gt;**Frontier history is a gauzy and unreliable pursuit, and Nearis Green’s story — built on oral history and the thinnest of archival trails — may never be definitively proved. Still, the decision to tell it resonates far beyond this small city**.

&gt;For years, the prevailing history of American whiskey has been framed as a lily-white affair, centered on German and Scots-Irish settlers who distilled their surplus grains into whiskey and sent it to far-off markets, eventually creating a $2.9 billion industry and a product equally beloved by Kentucky colonels and Brooklyn hipsters.

&gt;Left out of that account were men like Nearis Green. Slavery and whiskey, far from being two separate strands of Southern history, were inextricably entwined. Enslaved men not only made up the bulk of the distilling labor force, but they often played crucial skilled roles in the whiskey-making process. In the same way that white cookbook authors often appropriated recipes from their black cooks, white distillery owners took credit for the whiskey.


(The last paragraph makes possible assumptions and of course slave labor playing crucial roles in the distilling process for larger scale operations mean they were making the whiskey. Distilling = making)


To this...


&gt;No story is more truly and deeply American than the story of Jack Daniels whiskey and the Brown family. By truly and deeply I mean that the company, a century-and-a-half after its founding, is now publicly admitting that the down-home story they've always told about George Garvin Brown learning how to make the whiskey from an old white preacher named Dan Call is a lie.


&gt;George Garvin Brown learned to make whiskey from a black man named Nearis Green. Nearis Green, a highly skilled distiller, was also an enslaved American owned by Dan Call.
&gt;So, please allow me to reframe the story of Jack Daniels whiskey a bit.
&gt;A white Christian preacher in Lynchburg, Tenn., ""owned"" people. One of those people he ""owned"" was Nearis Green, a black man who was a skilled distiller of liquor. **That black man, a slave, taught George Garvin Brown how to make whiskey. The recipe and methods were deeply African**.

&gt;Even as late as last year, Jack Daniels was distributing carefully crafted infographics on the founding of the company — that never mention a single word about Nearis Green. Hundreds of thousands of people per year have been touring the Jack Daniels museum without a single mention of Nearis Green — not because his contribution was only recently discovered, but because the reality and truth of the company is far more complex and messy than they've ever really wanted to admit.
&gt;That, ladies and gentlemen, is the United States of America in a nutshell. How this country was founded, how wealth was made, and how it all has been maintained for centuries is not beautiful, but ugly and often malicious.

Is beyond me. Dan Call gave Jack Daniels an apprenticeship in the whiskey making trade. I assume Dan Call was using his own recipe that could have been influenced by Mr. Green and other slaves with West African Roots, along with the purification process, but Jack Daniels (based on what I just read because I've never looked into it before) bought a piece of land with a limestone cave and fresh spring used to make his whiskey. The spring water can make a difference and we know he did his own thing after leading the trade. Does anyone know if he used Dan Call's recipe which may have been influenced by Mr Green? No. I would assume he had his own twists. We do know he stayed on top of methods and perfected his own aged blend. We know that people from Europe and West Africa both brought traditions/a long standing culture of making alcohol with them. One whiskey/moonshine and the other a corn beer rand some fruit beverages. You can't say the culture of making whiskey was appropriated from slaves and no one knows anything about how Dan Call or Mr Greens recipe differed from Jack Daniels final product. They were two different individuals. There were parts of the oral history missing.

[Their money was worthless.](https://iconicphotos.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/img_0142.png?w=700&amp;h=568) The country was in a spiritual depression as well. Becoming a world leader would warp his mind, though. Blaming the Jews for Germany's problem is the same patter we see going on now, but it was just about blaming and segregating them until the war heated up and Germany was no longer an uncontested conquerer. Then the true atrocities, beyond simply the war and conquering, began. My point being a naturally desperate man created a bubble of idealism and became more desperate as it collapsed, and it's hard not to find blame to Hitler for all of our current problems because he did this.  

The genocide against the Jews and the Gays was terrible, but the effects on the world powers have caused far more reaching damage. The Jews needed to go somewhere after being rescued from Germany during or after the war. Putting so many in Israel would become the catalyst for the constant power struggles in the middle east.  

The United States was even changed in ridiculous ways. The nuclear bomb eventually led to the Cold War, and the massive propaganda and espionage race from that and WWII would spur the US to absurd levels of patriotism (""In God we Trust"" wasn't added to their money 'till the Cold War, after Russia's Communistic ideals caused them to reject religion from their state structure and the US tried to turn it on them.) and pride leading them from being rather self-effacing (they avoided WWII for a while, at least, though not for modesty) to becoming the bastards playing world police.

&gt; Paris has banned old cars from its streets in a war on air pollution that environmentalists hope will also drive dirty vehicles from the centres of other European cities.

&gt; From Friday, any car registered before 1 January 1997 will be banned from the city&amp;#039;s streets from Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm. Some owners protested by parking their vehicles near the National Assembly and Champs Elysees avenue to denounce a ban they said would hurt poor people most and slash the resale value of their vehicles.

&gt; Upwards of half a million owners in and around Paris will be hit by the ban, according to a driver defence group, 40 million d&amp;#039;Automobilistes, which is taking legal action to seek financial compensation for drops in the value of now-banned vehicles.

False,t5_2z8be,0,"ARTICLE 2 : How To MAXIMIZE Your Profits, Minimize Your EUR-USD Risks euroforexstrategies
Technical trading refers to the use of technical indicators on 
your Forex platform, to try to predict price movement of a 
currency pair.

Fundamental trading involves the use of economic news indicators 
as determinants of the direction of the affected currency pairs.

On its own, technical analysis is not sufficient for a trader 
to be able to create a trading plan that will deliver profits 
consistently.

Market sentiment and market direction is a function of the 
economic and political news that hit the newswires. Any 
trading plan that does not factor in these economic indicators 
is doomed to fail from the outset.

Let’s take for example, that the ECB Chairman is giving his speech 
and is fanning the embers of inflation control, signalling 
rate hikes, which would send traders into a Euro buying frenzy.

The ECB Chairman and the financial institutions that constitute 
and control the flow of over 80% of the $4.2trillion/day forex 
liquidity will not care if the EURUSD just did a double top 
or a descending triangle (bearish signals).

As far as the ECB Chairman is concerned, his mandate is to 
protect the low-inflation policy of the European Central 
bank, and if he has to increase interest rates to do so, 
he will.

The institutional traders will simple buy Euros in response 
to gain from the immediate capital gain in the market and 
also to earn from the increased Euro interest rate against 
the US dollar.

The candles will respond by going northwards, blowing off 
any trade that went short on a double top technical strategy. 
That is how the market works.

This is why the hallmark of trading has always been:

“Trigger fundamentally, enter and exit technically”.

What makes fundamental trading so important in forex trading?

Macroeconomic news items are released by government agencies 
and vey important private authorities.

The news is transparent, cannot be manipulated (like company’s 
earnings which are susceptible to accounting fraud), and 
is available to ALL market participants.

The dates and times of release are made known to all 
currency market traders well in advance, and the news is 
delivered to channels accessible to all traders; usually 
their trading platforms via news feed services of Bloomberg, 
Reuters, Dow Jones News Wires and TV stations like CNNMoney 
and CNBC. Insider leaks are rare.

Look, if you are currently not getting the results you want 
from your trades or worse; if you are suffering loss after
loss after loss in your trades right now, you simply
CANNOT afford to put this off.

Nothing to be ashamed off I assure you, I’ve been there myself
… so I KNOW how shitty &amp; frustrating it can be!

Yes.. I know!

So again, believe me when I say that you simply CANNOT 
afford to put it off anymore because if you keep trading 
the way you’ve always been trading, it’ll just be a matter 
of time until your entire account gets wiped out for good!

You don’t want to get a Margin Call, really.

The good news however is you DON’T have to let that happen. You don’t 
have to keep getting stopped out, stopped out… and stopped
out again.

And you DON’T have to rely on expensive, useless robots &amp;
trading softwares to help you, either!

You CAN trade to win.

It’s quite simple, really.

You just have to know HOW.

False,t5_2qh1e,0,"""As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I’m most often asked is ‘How fast would that SR-71 fly?’ I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It’s an interesting question, given the aircraft’s proclivity for speed, but there really isn’t one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute.

Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed.. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual ‘high’ speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn’t previously seen.

So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, ‘What was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?’ This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and I relayed the following.

I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England, with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refuelling over the North Sea, we proceeded to find the small airfield.

Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field-yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn’t see it. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren’t really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane levelled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass.

Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn’t say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet’s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of ‘breathtaking’ very well that morning and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach.

As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn’t spoken a word since ‘the pass.’ Finally, Walter looked at me and said, ‘One hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?’ Trying to find my voice, I stammered, ‘One hundred fifty-two.’ We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, ‘Don’t ever do that to me again!’ And I never did.

A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer’s club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, ‘It was probably just a routine low approach; they’re pretty impressive in that plane.’

When you have more people per square mile you have a greater base to draw on for public transport within that mile, so it becomes more cost effective.

But a big part of it is just that Americans really love their cars. Also, our cities are newer, so they are designed to accommodate cars in ways cities like Paris and London were not (which in turn makes the cities less dense, which in turn lowers the cost-effectiveness of public transportation). 

But a lot of cities I've been to could be doing so much better with their bus systems (which are pretty cheap, especially compared to subways). It's distressing.

&gt; Why not? Hitler was elected chanceller of Germany and then he eventually passed laws to kill Jews. He did this by nullifying the Weimar Constitution (which gave protection of religious freedom) in the name of security and stability in the Enabling Act of 1933.

The German system at the time allowed Hitler to come to power despite not being popular with more than half the population. In the United States, while not necessary, it is unusual for someone to win the election without having won the popular vote. 

&gt; Yeah but you're forgetting one key detail: how did it pass the Reichstag in the first place?

You're also forgetting the political environment. The Great Depression was ongoing and Germany was drifting back into increasing totalitarian views. While it can be argued that the US may have shifted right wards or more authoritarian, there's an enormous section of the population (including the right) which will not tolerate an authoritarian's will, including politicians. 

&gt; This is exactly how the SS started by the way: (...)

To be fair, Hitler was the founder of his party and the NSDAP was very hierarchical with Hitler at the apex and near complete obedience. Trump doesn't have his own party and even if he was in charge of the RNC and GOP, the GOP has much debate. Additionally, I highly doubt Trump would even want that sort of role. 

&gt; So you're telling me the only thing stopping a fascist from performing a genocide of Muslims is the CIA refusing to obey Trump? The same CIA that tortures Muslims (some innocent and as young as 13) in black sites around the world? The same CIA that overthrew the democratic Iran government (and many more, I believe 14 governments total) and planted a Western puppet that tortured and abducted innocent people for the sake of their own interests? The same CIA that performed the MKULTRA program where they tortured and forced drugs onto innocent American citizens? The same CIA that has committed so many atrocities that they have a dedicated list outlining all their atrocities.

CIA doesn't care about Muslims. They care about the preservation of their organization and serving national interest. They are not prejudiced, they do what they have to. Trump attempting to make the US into a genocidal state would not serve national interest and Trump being a dictator would hurt the CIAs desire for self-preservation which they'd stop. 

&gt; What stops Trump from defining Islam as an ideology and not a religion and thus nullifying any freedoms of religion granted by the constitution?

Congress, SCOTUS, the general population? Or even just the semantics and work that would have to put in and pass a bill defining the difference between religion, ideology and why Islam is one and not the other. It'd be incredibly difficult to find a way to linguistically make Islam an ideology without also making Christianity and Judaism and the other major religions ideologies as well. 

&gt; Of course, none of what you said counters the possibility that Trump creates his own paramilitary force like Hitler did with the SS.

You think the country that has more guns than people and the strongest military and intelligence agencies in the world will fall to a weak paramilitary force run by Trump?

&gt; Humans are not 100% rational. Look at how Hitler willingly decided to go to war, wrecked his country and then committed suicide. Assuming right-wing nationalism continues to climb in Europe as it currently is, I'm not sure if it's justified to say there will be a lot of countries willing to go to war. Maybe they won't support the US but they'll just turn a blind eye.

The people won't, it's not a popular idea to hate Muslims. Look at Trump's approval and disapproval ratings. Sure a ton of people like him but look how many vehemently hate him. I think the general public and public servants have enough conscience to not follow through, even if Trump gave genocidal orders (which I doubt he would, even if he won).

If the EU doesn't punish the UK and offers access to the common market the British economy might actually flourish. That might lead other nations' electorate to question the EU's political powers and ambitions. The EU would have to undergo massive change, would have to slim its budget and focus on being a modest trade and customs union to avoid further exits.

Alternatively they could try to punish the Brits for their decision, but the consequences might be dire. Our economies are highly interconnected. Every blow to the British economy might fire back. If stocks like Volkswagen (can't afford to have &gt;6% of sales threatened after Dieselgate), Siemens (had massive plans for investing in UK and now has to wait and discard its strategies if Brexit-negotiations become ugly) or Airbus (importing its wings and engines from the UK) plummet, the banks might fall right back into crisis (Deutsche Bank and parts of Santander just failed the US-stress-test two days ago, being very likely to fail if the markets tremble). So hurting the British, just to make sure that the politicians in Brussels and Strasbourg can proceed and keep their comfy positions, is a massive gamble that could backfire spectacularly (esp. since the ECB is already doing all it can to stabilize the Eurozone, not much they can do if another crisis strikes).

Macron on his assessment, I would really prefer his conclusion to be that the EU needs fundamentally change to keep the trust of the peoples of Europe and not to blackmail them to stay by making an example of the UK and gamble with all of Europe’s economies.",False,1467433443,PoliticalVideo,,1,frog_faced_toad,0,,t3_4qverh,1471151943,1,t3_4qverh,,d4w9vsh

Keep an eye on your air force. Keep air superiority in Britain and the Channel with fighters but send all excess into Africa.

He should send all of his army into Africa with the majority of his infantry by Abyssinia (Italian Ethiopia) with the remainder by Libya. Once Abyssinia is British take over Libya and liberate French Africa from the Italians - Italy and the other Axis powers won't be able to send reinforcements due to your naval dominance. 

Once Africa is made a safe haven begin launching naval invasions into Italy, which as Churchill put it is the ""soft underbelly"" of Hitler's Europe. 

By this time either the Soviet Union or Germany have declared war on each other - usually - and the US joins on your side. Basically just keep fighting in Italy until they capitulate or the Germans are losing/so far into Russia it won't matter. Then just naval invade near north Germany and Germany will capitulate. If Italy capitulates then a two pronged attack is always good. If this fails you will be able to just wait out the Germans.

Just don't bother attacking France directly. You won't gain anything from it and its far better to let the AI kill themselves attacking France whilst you do the actually work in Africa.

I am deeply regretful if this comment causes the people in this sub anger at me but I am simply calling a spade a spade. This sub does not know how critically assess the claims of individual scientists and institutions who have a vested interested in GMO technology. It is very saddening for me to see such an important technology that is undoubtedly going to have a huge impact on the world being totally misunderstood by this sub.

So that answers you second question, What does /r/skeptic think about a risk based approach to the question of GMO safety. The sad truth is /r/skeptic will be quite happy to defame you if you dare step out of line and have an independent thought. The absolute safety of GMO has already been scientifically proven and to doubt the stem master race science gods is a mortal offence.

As to your first question, are GMOs as safe as people insist. It depends what you mean by safe and it depends what you mean by GMO. Their is reasonably strong evidence that the GMO products currently on the market do not represent an acute health risk. Their is only weak evidence that the current GMO on the market today do not represent a low level chronic health risk. The scientists involved in these things, at least the ones employed by regulators such as in the EU will admit that they do not know how to answer this question. They recommend continuing surveillance of health risks after GMO products have gone to market. Of course this kind of study has nothing like the power of a controlled trail so it is very possible for a product to go to market that has a non acute health risk and for that to not be picked up on for decades. Speaking out of both sides of their mouths EU regulators write GMO and non GMO cultivars carry the same risks but strangely no money is being sought for further studies into the risks of non GMO varieties after they go on the market. Two main types of GMO are available on the market today. Ones that offer herbicide resistance and once that produce an insecticide protein. The possible health risk for the first variety is from the herbicide that they are invariably grown with and the health risk from the second one is a link to the gut bacteria that may be effected by the insecticide protein. Scientists admit they do not know how to definitively asses the risks of these two possibilities, they admit their may be other possibilities they haven't considered. Anybody telling you their is a scientific consensus about the safety of GMO is either lying, not telling the whole truth, or is most likely parroting something they heard without understanding the true situation.

All of this says nothing about the future of GMOs which I am sure will be glorious and amazing. GMO technology represents a fantastic achievement of human intelligence and ingenuity. Many ambitious, wonderful and strange proposals are being worked on and more are in the pipeline. Scientists admit they only have a tenuous grasp on what kind of methodologies they might use to asses the health risk of future GMO varieties. One thing all of the science, reports, articles, and summaries I have read about the future of GMO do contain is that the adoption and development of GMO technology carries with it a risk. 

**If their is a scientific consensus around GMO it is not that GMO is safe, rather it is that GMO development  and deployment inevitably comes with a risk, and it is essential to have a well funded, independent, strong, and scientifically capable regulatory sector to double check the work of commercial, non-profit, government backed, or indeed any kind GMO venture, initiative or development.**",False,1467440553,skeptic,,-5,ObeyTheCowGod,0,,t3_4qub7f,1471153274,-5,t3_4qub7f,,d4wcpix

False,t5_2qh4r,0,"10 Reasons to Avoid GMOs
1. GMOs are unhealthy.
The American Academy of Environmental Medicine (AAEM) urges doctors to prescribe non-GMO diets for all patients. They cite animal studies showing organ damage, gastrointestinal and immune system disorders, accelerated aging, and infertility. Human studies show how genetically modified (GM) food can leave material behind inside us, possibly causing long-term problems. Genes inserted into GM soy, for example, can transfer into the DNA of bacteria living inside us, and that the toxic insecticide produced by GM corn was found in the blood of pregnant women and their unborn fetuses.

Numerous health problems increased after GMOs were introduced in 1996. The percentage of Americans with three or more chronic illnesses jumped from 7% to 13% in just 9 years; food allergies skyrocketed, and disorders such as autism, reproductive disorders, digestive problems, and others are on the rise. Although there is not sufficient research to confirm that GMOs are a contributing factor, doctors groups such as the AAEM tell us not to wait before we start protecting ourselves, and especially our children who are most at risk.

The American Public Health Association and American Nurses Association are among many medical groups that condemn the use of GM bovine growth hormone, because the milk from treated cows has more of the hormone IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1)―which is linked to cancer.

2. GMOs contaminate―forever.
GMOs cross pollinate and their seeds can travel. It is impossible to fully clean up our contaminated gene pool. Self-propagating GMO pollution will outlast the effects of global warming and nuclear waste. The potential impact is huge, threatening the health of future generations. GMO contamination has also caused economic losses for organic and non-GMO farmers who often struggle to keep their crops pure.

3. GMOs increase herbicide use.
Most GM crops are engineered to be “herbicide tolerant”―they deadly weed killer. Monsanto, for example, sells Roundup Ready crops, designed to survive applications of their Roundup herbicide.

Between 1996 and 2008, US farmers sprayed an extra 383 million pounds of herbicide on GMOs. Overuse of Roundup results in “superweeds,” resistant to the herbicide. This is causing farmers to use even more toxic herbicides every year. Not only does this create environmental harm, GM foods contain higher residues of toxic herbicides. Roundup, for example, is linked with sterility, hormone disruption, birth defects, and cancer.

4. Genetic engineering creates dangerous side effects.
By mixing genes from totally unrelated species, genetic engineering unleashes a host of unpredictable side effects. Moreover, irrespective of the type of genes that are inserted, the very process of creating a GM plant can result in massive collateral damage that produces new toxins, allergens, carcinogens, and nutritional deficiencies.

5. Government oversight is dangerously lax.
Most of the health and environmental risks of GMOs are ignored by governments’ superficial regulations and safety assessments. The reason for this tragedy is largely political. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for example, doesn’t require a single safety study, does not mandate labeling of GMOs, and allows companies to put their GM foods onto the market without even notifying the agency. Their justification was the claim that they had no information showing that GM foods were substantially different. But this was a lie. Secret agency memos made public by a lawsuit show that the overwhelming consensus even among the FDA’s own scientists was that GMOs can create unpredictable, hard-to-detect side effects. They urged long-term safety studies. But the White House had instructed the FDA to promote biotechnology, and the agency official in charge of policy was Michael Taylor, Monsanto’s former attorney, later their vice president. He’s now the US Food Safety Czar.

6. The biotech industry uses “tobacco science” to claim product safety.
Biotech companies like Monsanto told us that Agent Orange, PCBs, and DDT were safe. They are now using the same type of superficial, rigged research to try and convince us that GMOs are safe. Independent scientists, however, have caught the spin-masters red-handed, demonstrating without doubt how industry-funded research is designed to avoid finding problems, and how adverse findings are distorted or denied.

7. Independent research and reporting is attacked and suppressed. 
Scientists who discover problems with GMOs have been attacked, gagged, fired, threatened, and denied funding. The journal Nature acknowledged that a “large block of scientists . . . denigrate research by other legitimate scientists in a knee-jerk, partisan, emotional way that is not helpful in advancing knowledge.” Attempts by media to expose problems are also often censored.

8. GMOs harm the environment.
GM crops and their associated herbicides can harm birds, insects, amphibians, marine ecosystems, and soil organisms. They reduce bio-diversity, pollute water resources, and are unsustainable. For example, GM crops are eliminating habitat for monarch butterflies, whose populations are down 50% in the US. Roundup herbicide has been shown to cause birth defects in amphibians, embryonic deaths and endocrine disruptions, and organ damage in animals even at very low doses. GM canola has been found growing wild in North Dakota and California, threatening to pass on its herbicide tolerant genes on to weeds.

9. GMOs do not increase yields, and work against feeding a hungry world.
Whereas sustainable non-GMO agricultural methods used in developing countries have conclusively resulted in yield increases of 79% and higher, GMOs do not, on average, increase yields at all. This was evident in the Union of Concerned Scientists’ 2009 report Failure to Yield―the definitive study to date on GM crops and yield.

The International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) report, authored by more than 400 scientists and backed by 58 governments, stated that GM crop yields were “highly variable” and in some cases, “yields declined.” The report noted, “Assessment of the technology lags behind its development, information is anecdotal and contradictory, and uncertainty about possible benefits and damage is unavoidable.” They determined that the current GMOs have nothing to offer the goals of reducing hunger and poverty, improving nutrition, health and rural livelihoods, and facilitating social and environmental sustainability.
On the contrary, GMOs divert money and resources that would otherwise be spent on more safe, reliable, and appropriate technologies.

10. By avoiding GMOs, you contribute to the coming tipping point of consumer rejection, forcing them out of our food supply.
Because GMOs give no consumer benefits, if even a small percentage of us start rejecting brands that contain them, GM ingredients will become a marketing liability. Food companies will kick them out. In Europe, for example, the tipping point was achieved in 1999, just after a high profile GMO safety scandal hit the papers and alerted citizens to the potential dangers. In the US, a consumer rebellion against GM bovine growth hormone has also reached a tipping point, kicked the cow drug out of dairy products by Wal-Mart, Starbucks, Dannon, Yoplait, and most of America’s dairies.

NOTE: As an additional motivation to avoid GMOs, you may wish to take a lesson from the animals. Eyewitness reports from around the world describe several situations where animals, when given a choice, avoid genetically modified food. These include cows, pigs, geese, elk, deer, raccoons, mice, rats, squirrels, chicken, and buffalo. We’re pretty sure the animals didn’t read the above 10 reasons.
