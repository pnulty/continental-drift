also average length of czech government is 3 years and we have periodically repeating winners of the election - left/right with sligthly prevailing left wing - also its worth noting that there never was a party in czech parliament with more then 35% - which means that  parties never made one colored government /please correct me fellow czechs if i am wrong

0,"Yes, if lab-grown beef takes off and replaces the slaughter-based beef industry, then the global population of cattle will decrease. The same thing happened with horses. The global population of horses peaked just before the widespread adoption of automobiles and tractors. Now horses are only raised for sport or kept by hobbyists.

This is a good thing, though. The current state of the beef industry is a huge drain on land, water, and contributes to the accumulation of greenhouse gases through methane emissions. With fewer cows, these resources can be put to better use, and what cows that do remain will likely have a much higher quality of life, since they will still be kept by hobbyists and more subsistence-based communities.

There is also a growing interest in Pleistocene re-wilding. This is the idea that we should try to reverse the negative impacts that humans have had on ecosystems, including the long-term goal of re-introducing the megafauna that have gone extinct due to human activity, or at least close ecological equivalents. Many ecologists claim that many ecological communities do not function appropriately in the absence of megafauna, because much of the native flora and fauna evolved under the influence of large mammals. This would perhaps include breeding back the aurochs that domestic cattle were bred from, and reintroducing them to wilds of Eurasia and Northern Africa.

Here is a good picture that illustrates the stark difference of representative fauna of Central Europe between today and just a few thousand years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/Paleontology/comments/4nqg05/the_fauna_of_central_europe_in_the_pleistocene/

0,"Hi, I'm late to the party but i wanted to give you my opinion anyway. For reference, I'm a 20 year old student, studying Psychology with plans on working for the NHS.

Initially, I voted yes for a plethora of reasons, such as belief in Nuclear Weapons, privatization of the NHS, the social/political differences between Scotland the the rest of the UK and most importantly, I believed in securing more powers for my Government (which unlike Westminster seems to act in the peoples best interest).

Nicola Sturgeon (First Minister of Scotland) recently began preliminary negotiations with the EU regarding the status of Scotland (who had a majority remain vote) and about potentially joining the EU as an independent nation. As a result of these talks, both France and Spain have publicly stated that [if the UK leaves the EU, Scotland leaves too.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36656980). This creates far too much uncertainty about the future of an independent Scotland, and instead i think it would be better to both remain as a part of the EU and as part of the UK. We have a similar precedence from Greenland (1995) (A teritory of Denmark which voted to leave the EU, even though Denmark remained to stay), and similarly whilst the UK is part of the EU, part of the crown territories (Isles of Man for example) are not part of the EU.

With this, i think we'd be best pursuing EU membership as a devolved state, whilst remaining in the UK. With this, the UK doesn't lose it's 2nd largest economy and Scotland doesn't lose the UK or the EU. Further, it could create precedence for DevoMax, which i've always believed would be the best option in reference to Independence.

The powercreep was often extremely linear, even more so than pad, so it was pretty common for a unit or entire batch of units to be strictly outclassed by something released 1-2 months after it.  NA players would always be saying ""don't pull for x because x2 is coming in 2 months"" and then, ""don't pull for x2 because x3 makes it irrelevant"", etc.  Updated old units were so delayed that they were usually worthless by the time they reached NA. 

The EU server was even ~further~ behind, almost an entire year total behind JP.

So presumably as a ""solution"", the NA and EU devs started releasing completely batshit overpowered server exclusive units on par with or more powerful than whatever just got shat out of jp, that would obliterate whatever content just got localized, that was intended to challenge things released 4 months ago.

0,"To be honest, I think you're looking backwards. Post-Brexit, things are going to change a lot. The economy is going to falter, people are going to get poorer, the discontent are going to become more so.

A centrist position in a time of social discontent is a wasted position. Look at Greece. Look at Spain. People aren't interested in continuing the status quo. They are either going to go further to the right, or further to the left. People are saying UKIP are finished, but I think UKIP, or whatever they create after UKIP are going to be more important than ever.

So there's your right-wing protest vote. The Tories have been in power for 6 years and no-one's lot is going to improve under them, regardless of how this plays out, so they are going to lose votes if the next election isn't called this year before things start getting really shitty.

A centrist position, promising a little of this and a little of that isn't going to cut it any more. It's backward thinking. The voters are going to vote more radical in the future, so if you want to get support, it's better to be radical than to try and join the cluster in the middle. 

I know you don't think this is true, and it's not, not yet. But it will be, and elections across Europe prove that. Labour is better off setting up it's stall as a force for radical change now rather than trying to catch up in 5 years time.

0,"It's a mix of reasons for why they are leaving I imagine.  If their team was actually winning EU maybe they stick with it.  They don't look close to being able to do that, and there is no reason to believe there are other players available that could form a new roster that would have a significantly better chance to contend.

HOTS doesn't have a big enough audience to be worth carrying a mediocre team, and HOTS doesn't have enough financial incentive for top tier pros from other MOBA's to switch to HOTS whether they like the game more or not.  

I don't think the game is too casual though.  If you watched the Summer Championship between MVP_Black and Tempest, you can see that most current pro teams aren't close to that level of skill.  Certainly the average hero league player isn't.  If more pro games were played at that level of skill then I imagine the viewership and popularity would rise.  Getting players of that skill to play the game rather than something else that has more financial incentives is one of the challenge Blizzard faces as an e-sport.  

As a viewer experience their challenge is leveraging their shorter game lengths into tournaments with minimal delays and scheduling them when audiences can watch (not during work/school hours on a week day for example).  Short games with lots of action are great for short attention span viewers, but not if the delays in between games feel longer than the games are.

United need to clean out a lot of deadwood in their midfield, I also think Jose will take some time to settle because he will be trying to play more attacking football than he's used to. The reason I say this is because it was one of his ""promises"" prior to signing. 

City will be good but have to make a lot of changes to fit Peps style of play. I don't think any of their midfielders and few attackers fit his one touch tiki taka style. A tough transfer market will be our friend against them. 

Chelsea will need time as well to adjust to Conte. He demands hard work and sacrifice for the team and I just don't see anyone on Chelsea's squad embodying that ethic. A lack of European play like ourselves will help them though.

Arsenal will be good if they sign another striker and CB. We can almost rely on Wenger to miss an important signing though so we'll see.

Liverpool on the other hand need another midfielder. We have plenty of attacking options. I'm not worried about that. Also, depending on if Sakho is banned or not, we will need another CB if he is. A LB would be good as well, I'd love one like Chilwell and still think Moreno can develop into what we need. Lack of Europe will be beneficial as well.

0,"I'm going to try to address why white people wearing their hair in dreadlocks is considered offensive. Dreadlocks are a common, normal, traditional hairstyle for black people, and yet it is considered ""unprofessional"" and ""gangster"" when they actually wear their hair in that style. It's considered dirty and low class despite often being very clean and one of the only easy ways for some people to manage their hair. Many professional black women are pressured into paying huge sums of money for fake weaves or hair relaxers in order to get straight hair and abide by western beauty standards in order to get jobs they couldn't get if they wore their hair in dreadlocks. This is part of a common phenomenon where people pretend to be totally fine with black people as long as they don't embrace or celebrate black culture at all (god forbid they use ebonics) and instead act, for all intents and purposes, ""white"". See: Obama.

So now when white people go out and put their hair in dreadlocks they are allowed to because they come from a place of power and privilege and aren't discriminated against because of it in the same way. So now the same people that told black communities they were unprofessional for wearing their hair in dreadlocks have essentially stolen that aspect of their culture. 

Imagine if after we ""civilized"" native americans and destroyed their language a group of white people decided that they wanted to speak Cherokee because they thought it sounded cool, and they were allowed to because they were white so when they do it they aren't savages, but when natives do it they were.

Furthermore if we look at current pop stars the only top black female artists are ones that have essentially dropped their black culture and image. Rihanna and beyonce only became popular because once they conformed to western beauty standards. Rihanna only became famous after she got a nose job to change her traditionally wide, black nose into a European one. Beyonce straightens and dyes her hair blond and has only recently reached a point where she's reached fame untouchable enough to begin celebrating her identity as a black woman with ""Formation."" And she was still criticized for it.

image of Kesha and try to tell me that doesn't encourage negative stereotypes. I understand that that is an extreme example but she is using dreadlocks to create a ""gangster"" image. 

It is always going to be difficult to draw a line between cultural appropriation and regular cultural adaptation. But in cases where the original culture has been discriminated against for the thing being adopted it becomes offensive for the privileged culture to adopt it.

0,"Yeah they do have better mid late game RATINGS, but this isn't a good indicator of how good or bad TSM's mid/late game actually is. For one, TSM's game time is usually ~32 mins, the fastest in both leagues I believe. This means that there is an unusually small sample size for their lategame, so yeah, I'd expect their lategame rating to be a bit worse.

I disagree with your assessment of the players. Starting from mid, yeah Febi and Perkz have had their moments, but neither has shown us the crazy amount of pressure that Bjergsen and Jensen exert. 

You can't realistically make the argument that oh because trick and spirit outperform their counterparts more they are better when half of the EU junglers have no understanding of counterjungling. If TSM were to face off against either G2 or FNC the fact that Febi or Perkz would have their lane pushed in 85% of the time would mean Sven can get free reign to invade constantly. On top of that, you're forgetting the fact that what Sven sacrifices in his KDA, he makes up for being the role player of the team. Always distracting the enemy so TSM can grab an objective. Mechanically as well Sven is better than either of the Koreans here. And saying Trick+Perkz is better than Bjerg+Sven is just ignorant. Firstly, Bjerg and Sven have more history together as they played together on CW. Secondly, unlike Perkz+Trick, Bjerg and Sven are better coordinated when it comes to grabbing objectives and applying pressure around the map. Just look at enemy buffs stolen for proof. Advantage Sven, no question.

Botlane, yeah Mithy and Zven are straight up better than Biolift. However, Zven is only slightly better than Double when it comes to team fight positioning and I'd argue that they'd go even in lane. We've yet to see how Bio performs under pressure, but considering that he has the best KDA of any support in LCS that has played every game, I don't think G2 could grab an advantage botlane. I can see them going even, but that's about it. I love YS and Rekkles, but let's not kid ourselves, that's not a mechanically dominant botlane. In the case of G2, they have a slight advantage in the fact that Mithy's roams kinda make up for the fact that Perkz as very little pressure outside of midlane, but it's still only an A+ botlane vs an A botlane. From a mechanical point of view, you would be hard pressed to argue otherwise.

Lol Hauntzer would smash either toplaners face in, it wouldn't be close. The difference in skill and map awareness here is so large, I wouldn't be surprised if G2 or FNC just stuck their toplaners on tanks and just prayed that they wouldn't get destroyed.

0,"&gt;Tanks as an anti tank weapon is actually kind of a late WWII idea. Think about the american usage of the sherman in europe. There were crews who wouldn't fit the 76mm upgrade because the 75mm high explosive round was better. Tanks are also very useful for destroying emplacements and machinegun nests.

That's not entirely correct, tanks were always designed with the idea of taking out other tanks being one of their roles, but you're correct in that they do have multiple roles and the multi-purpose 75mm gun was preferred until very late in the war over the AT-specialized 76mm gun.

&gt;The argument though somewhat misses the point.

My point was that the number of rounds expended in an actual war is not going to be comparable to the number of rounds you see fired in a War Thunder game, by any means. War Thunder is limited to tank-on-tank battles, where accurate fire is necessary, and not saturation fire or, as you mention, demolition work. The statement about the accuracy being unrealistic is entirely false, since War Thunder limits tanks to filling such a specific role, one that was not seen nearly as often in real life.

Thus, because it's so heavily based on being able to put every round exactly where you want it, being the first to shoot is going to be a huge advantage, just like how having the superior climb rate is a huge advantage in air. And similar to how slower-climbing planes are going to have a more difficult time in air than faster-climbing ones, players that find themselves a little slow on the draw will have to find a way to fight around that disadvantage.

In RB, this is generally ambushing other tanks, since you can flank and conceal yourself much more easily with no nametags over players. Some of my best games in RB, I barely even moved, I find a well-covered spot against some rocks, with a background where I would be concealed and not silhouetting myself, overlooking a common route that players take, and I just waited for tanks to drive by. This is still shooting first, but guaranteeing myself a ""shoot first"" advantage by using a little strategy, like how climbing above the enemy in a plane guarantees that you will start on the offensive and force the enemy to defend against your dive.

Driving around aggressively without concern for sightlines would turn RB into a twitch shooter, and because of Soviet tanks' lack of gun depression forcing them to brawl, this is one reason Soviet tanks are disliked in RB so much. However, in AB you have nametags that spoil any concealment or movement you might be trying to make, so everyone ends up brawling around capture points, which is indeed very twitch-shooter-like.",False,False,t5_2uc6j,Warthunder,pretty much only any good at American planes,4,smittywjmj,0,1467340506,1471072600,4,us,t1_d4uu8sr,t3_4qoz1c,,d4uuqez

Needless to say, such a far out prediction is used more as indicators than exact figures. This is also why I don't tend to talk about long term predictions in my posts about Brexit. I simply state what the banks are more certain about and it's more an educated guess than a wild swing in the dark. 

2) Their assumptions are a bit stretched. They say post Nexit, within 6 months ~ 1 yr, GDP growth stabilize will be at 1% (doesn't even go negative) and after that, GDP growth will be at 2% for roughly 10 years before reaching their terminal growth rate.

Well, using those assumptions, literally any EU country would look good. From 1988 to 2016, Netherlands hasn't hit 2% GDP growth once. They peaked in the 1990s at like 1.7% i think so even if you assume that Nexit will help your GDP, you have to slowly ramp up from their 2015 GDP growth of roughly 0.1 or 0.2%. 

Overall, I believe that these guys are experts at what they do. I am not a macroeconomist so they clearly understand more than I do in that regard. They present valid economic data but it's in the assumptions they make that I think there's a few flaws. This also happens to be my strong suit as I do financial modeling for work.  This is also pretty normal considering they were commissioned to do this by a group that obviously wants these results. 

Lastly, I'm so disappointed in their sensitivity tests. It's like college freshman model level of sensitivity testing. They run it against 1 changed factor and use those 2 numbers as their range of 1.1~1.5b. Usually you run multiple factors that can change for at least 9 possible scenarios with your highs and lows as your range.

---

&gt; * The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that Britains shock vote to leave the European Union a week ago has created uncertainty that poses a major threat to the global economy.

&gt; * We see the uncertainty right now as probably the biggest risk to the global economy, said IMF spokesman Gerry Rice, calling on European leaders and other policymakers to take decisive actions that could lower the threat.

&gt; * British Prime Minister David Cameron, who resigned after the June 23 Brexit vote, has resisted pressure to immediately activate the Article 50 mechanism to leave the EU, saying he is leaving it to his successor, who will not be named until September 9.

&gt; * Brexit has created significant uncertainty and we believe this is likely to dampen growth in the near term, particularly in the UK but with repercussions also for Europe and for the world economy, said Mr Rice in a regularly scheduled IMF news conference.

Mas, em primeiro momento, lembre que não existe ""país paraíso"" nesse planeta. Falando da raça humana em traços gerais, *je suis* tudo farinha do mesmo saco. Em certo grau, em qualquer lugar do mundo, em todas as áreas de conhecimento e sobrevivência, todo ser humano é egoísta.

Boa parte dos problemas que você vê aqui (pra não falar em todos) são de origem cultural. Só que isso não é exclusivo do Brasil. Cada cultura extravasa seus defeitos de alguma maneira. Nós fazemos isso ""dano um jeitinho"" pra tudo.

Na democracia, tudo demora e muito se nivela por baixo até que as coisas engrenem para que a maioria aproveite seus benefícios. Isso é normal! Democracia anda com passos de tartaruga, mudanças importantes levam gerações para se consolidarem. Enquanto isso, vivemos ansiosos para ver dias melhores no nosso tempo.

Essa frustração não deixa de ser um defeito da cultura do ""jeitinho"". Estamos tão acostumados a ""dar um jeitinho"" para resolver as coisas logo e continuar com a vida que, quando nos deparamos com as consequências desse costume no âmbito nacional, sentimos raiva por não ter conseguido superá-lo. É como um cachorro correndo atrás do próprio rabo, sentindo raiva por que não queria ter nascido com rabo.

They've changed their tune that's all that matters. It just indicates that they will be relaxing some of the demands. If they are preparing the nation for a particular situation via press releases from the ones who lead the campaign it's a damn good indicator. Either way if the opposite is true that we are leaving EU entirely, then the markets shouldn't be bullish.

&gt;As for Remain backpedalling, did you watch Savid Javid on the Andrew Marr show on Sunday where he went back on every single thing he'd said during his campaigning for Remain? He also admitted the £30Bn punishment budget was a lie too.

I don't understand what Javid or Remain campaign has to do with it. They would be negotiating single market access no matter what. They are not going to suddenly change their mind and go ""Oh yeah we don't need europe. Sorry my mistake."" 

It's not about whose morally right or wrong. It's about what sort of returns markets expect which are directly linked with the negotiations. If the UK leaves the single market then everyone is going to be worse which would mean losses to investors.

I'm trying to figure out the explanation for what is happening but it sort of makes little sense to me.

* **Notail** the fucking flower, being a crowd favorite who seems to be one of the more passionate players of the game. He also has had a pretty colorful history as well in some good teams like Fnatic, C9, Secret and now OG

* **PLD** for being one of the best and most innovative support players in the game, regarded as the best in the world after MLG and makes for a good comeback story after getting back into Secret

**SEA:**

 - **Mushi** though he's declined as of late, he was THE Southeast Asian player in Dota *(ChuaN doesn't count since he's pretty much only played in Chinese teams)*, from leading Orange to their top 3 finish in TI3 *(and almost stopping Alliance vs Na'Vi grand finals)* to leading the DK dream team in TI4. He's also one of the oldest players being here since Dota 1 *(and I still remember the hype when he would visit our country and play in our net cafes)*
 - **iceiceice** probably one of the biggest faces in dota, and definitely the biggest troll in it *(though I guess Moon is trying to match him)*. His backstory can probably be something really crazy and it would be hilarious and a nice change of pace from the potential drama or seriousness in the others
 - **Febby** for being homeless BibleThump, plus he's got a lot of drama going on as well such as what happened to some of his older teams (and Blitz BibleThump). BibleThumps all around with him

**CN**

- **BurNing** because it's pretty hard to create a documentary without one of the greatest ""Old Guard"" players in China, well regarded by both east and west and being one of the most flexible carries in later years (though Hao, END and Aggressif have already surpassed him though)

- **xiao8** because... he's fucking xiao8, the Puppey of the east, consistently leading both old and new teams to TI and captaining some of the most impressive teams in the east

- **LanM** because he's got a massive dick, nuff said

It would really only work within one country and even then would be tricky. Russia has a team league but it's too big of a country to try offline. Germany or France may be able to support an offline team league but it would need to include other smaller teams since you are ignoring all NA and teams with players outside those countries (so you lose teams like ROOT, Cascade, mYinsanity, TeS, Flipside, and PSISTORM).

There are offline team leagues, Wardi runs the best one outside of China, and I'd love to see Blizzard boost the prize pool, but with foreign teams so spread out (even in Europe you'd lose about half the teams) it would just be impossible to have an offlline ProLeague.

&gt; Canada will deploy 1,000 soldiers in Latvia to one of four battalions Nato is assembling in eastern Europe in response to Russia&amp;#039;s annexation of Crimea, Canadian media reported Thursday.

&gt; Along with the US, Britain and Germany, Canada &amp;quot;Will establish and lead&amp;quot; a high-readiness brigade that will &amp;quot;Contribute to Nato&amp;#039;s enhanced forward presence in Eastern and Central Europe,&amp;quot; the defense ministry said in a statement, adding that more details would be provided at a Nato summit in Poland next month.

&gt; The announcement comes a day after the US president, Barack Obama, challenged Canada to do more to support Nato during a speech in the Canadian parliament.

0,"I wanna reply to the folk writing Chris about how to get out of the rat race and start and adventure. It's not that hard. Not saying I'm an expert nomad but I've been going for awhile. I think most people are over complicating things. Honestly being a normie is way harder than living in hostels, hitchhiking, working seasonally and chasing sex and adventure around the world. 

* If you live anywhere in the con. USA you're a few days hitchhike from a sunny beach in Mexico, when you get there you'll find the hippies that will tell you what to do next.

* There is always work on farms, picking fruit, trimming weed, driving a harvester, whatever. You can hitchhike to the farms.

* Once you've spent a night or two sleeping on the ground at a truck stop, you'll realise it's not a condition to fear, you might even start to like it. 

* Wanna sail to Europe for free? Take a sailing trip to the Bahamas? Now would be a good time to start walking the docks and asking people if they need extra crew. Or get on Crewseekers.com or other such website. I'm sure you can find a pdf of sailing for dummies to flick through before you cast off.

* Go stay in a Hostel. Even in your own city, ask people how they're doing what they're doing, they will tell you. 

* As for the wine thing, Chris keeps saying Vineyard but you want to be in the Winery! in Europe (and the USA) vineyards are peasant farmed, don't take their jobs. wineries typically double their staff around harvest time (July - December in Northern Hemisphere, Jan - May in Southern). It helps if you're into Wine; read a book about it or something. 

* HelpX and WWOOFING are a good idea but you could possibly just find a job that pays real money just as easily. 

* Depending on how old you are and what country you're a citizen of, look into Working Holiday VISAS. If you're a yank under 30 (I think?) you can come to Australia for a year and work any job you want (and there's plenty of them)!

The important point is just to go out there. Once you get on the road, you will meet people who will share their experiences and advice. They might even take you with them for a bit. You might even get to sleep with them if you play your cards right. 

Personally I've never left the house with more than a couple grand in the bank; sometimes closer to a couple hundred. Often I've come back wealthier than when I started. 

Don't be a weirdo. Don't ruin it for the rest of us. Don't endlessly research and email people asking for advice you'll never follow. Just get out there and do it!

I hope this helps some people. Have fun!

&gt; White man's burden was a cheap and poor attempt to justify imperialism.

It was used by some as an excuse. There's evidence that the original poem was satire.

&gt; It was wrong because it didn't make anybody's lives better.

But why didn't it? Europe had higher standards of living than any other part of the world, aside from maybe China, at the time. So why wouldn't imposing European standards result in a European-like outcome? 

Because it's a lot more complicated than that.

&gt; The fact that you think it's okay for other people to go out and colonize and enslave other people so long as it's not you doing it indicates to me that you don't actually care whether or not people get enslaved or colonized.

Oh look, the irrational leaps of logic have begun.

1) I never said that ""it's okay for other people to go out and colonize and enslave other people so long as it's not you doing it.""

2) Even if I did, it doesn't follow that I do not care.

&gt; Now, I don't think that's actually what you believe, but that's the conclusion you're pretty much lining me up for.

That is due to your own ridiculous moral reasoning and the massive gaps your logic.

&gt; Look at the consequences of what you're saying:

Literally none of your four points are ""consequences"" of what I'm saying.

&gt; Stopping the Nazis was wrong. You should have let them do the holocaust. It was actually the allies (any of whom which weren't attacked) who were in the wrong.

I never said, nor even *implied,* any of this. Further, it's historically inaccurate *since the holocaust was not widely known until 1944, or well after all major nations had gotten involved.*

I am simply saying that the innumerable nations that chose not to intervene are not evil -- which is your position.

&gt; It is morally permissible to watch somebody die when you could lift a finger to save them.

Yes. Insofar as you are not morally obligated to risk or sacrifice your life for another's.

&gt; I don't see how you can talk out of one side of your mouth claiming that intervention is bad but then say that lifting a finger to save somebody's life is good.

Really? I can. Because they aren't the same thing. At all.

1) I never claimed that intervention is bad. That is a blanket statement I didn't use.

2) A nation-state launching an intervention against another nation-state is basically nothing like ""lifting a finger to save somebody's life."" The scale, the scope, the potential downside. In no more than the most general, vapid sense are the two ideas related.

The above is true however this isn't all the EU did, thus generally it could be a net positive but I'm not going to say either way.  Ron Paul frequently issued state's rights arguments.   Libertarians don't believe in state's rights but can use this as an argument.  In theory it gets closer to individual, but isolated individuals can be more authoritarian bcause the state still holds over over some of people.

&gt;-Rights are God given and begin with private property and one's body. Individual sovereignty protected by the second amendment.

This is a classical liberal argument but not a very effective in modern times.  If god doesn't exist then suddenly rights don't either.

&gt;-Participation in the state is an extension of private property whereby the individual gives up a certain amount of individual sovereignty in exchange for certain public services and representation/voting. States keep this local.

This is actually ""real"" socialists claim.  Capitalism can only exist with a state blah blah blah. Private property doesn't need a state only property ""norms"".  This is a reason I describe ancapism as post-democracy.

&gt;The borders of the USA are, by extension, the borders of our private property as a nation and deserve to be defended.

This is reverse.  Private property can create borders.  But norms probably include easements anyway with possible exceptions of commnities like those on the border that have shown a desire to contain issues.

 &gt;-Larger state-like entities such as the EU tend to fail because people don't want to cede sovereignty to people living far away, from another culture, with totally different goal and priorities (see the attitude of Brexiters towards Belgium)

True.  Economically this was identified as the economic calculation problem.  Social standards are similar but likely won't make or break a state.  We have two (more or less) large cultural differences in the US and it leads to pissed off people but not the state collapsing.

&gt;Really mass immigration is just another government program. Mass immigration is very engine by which ""big government"" is created. The democrats import millions of third worlders thus providing a false ""boost"" to GDP and tax revenues 

Increasing economic activity is not a failure of capitalism (classical US libertarian goal).  It isn't a bug, but as feature.  This is why we support it.

Britain’s 850,000 Polish citizens face backlash after Brexit vote


June 28 

The English town of Boston, dubbed ""the most Eastern European town in Britain"" by British tabloids, has long attracted Poles to the regional agriculture industry. (Reuters)

Britain's vote to leave the European Union last week led to a near-immediate spike in reports of racist incidents. But while there is no shortage of British racism towards familiar scapegoats such as Muslims and nonwhite immigrants, two of the most notable post-Brexit events focused instead on immigrants from a predominantly white and Christian European country: Poland.

""Go home"" were the words written on the Polish Social and Cultural Association's building in West London. Meanwhile in Cambridgeshire, laminated cards were distributed with the message “Leave the EU/No more Polish vermin,” written in not only English but also Polish. These two instances of anti-Polish sentiment have prompted a high-level official response from British authorities, with Prime Minister David Cameron suggesting that such behavior ""must be stamped out"" during a speech at Parliament on Monday. The Polish embassy in London also responded, releasing a statement that said it was ""shocked and deeply concerned"" by the reports.

Anti-Polish sentiment is far from new to Britain. According to figures obtained by the Guardian, in 2013, British police officers arrested at least 585 people for hate crimes against Polish people – a figure that may be a large understatement, as the newspaper was only able to get numbers from 26 of the country's 46 police forces. A survey from 2014 found that 81 percent of Polish people living in Britain had been subjected to verbal or physical abuse or knew another Polish person who had who had.

These incidents appear to have become more common as Britian's Polish population grew. There has long been a Polish community in Britain – some Polish insurgents against the Russian Empire relocated to Britain after the November Uprising of 1831, for example. Polish troops were also important allies for Britain during World War II, and after that war many were allowed to live in Britain through the Polish Resettlement Act of 1947.

But things really changed in 2004. Poland was one of 10 countries to join the E.U. that year, and Britain was one of just three member states to allow these new European citizens to work immediately in the country. Polish citizens were now part of the European principle of freedom of movement. Prompted by high unemployment and low wages at home, many young Polish citizens opted to be a part of it: About 2 million Poles have left the country since 2004. While significant numbers of the Polish citizens headed to Germany and Ireland, Britain was the intended destination for many: With an estimated headcount of 850,000, Polish citizens are the largest group of foreign citizens in the country.

A negative stereotype quickly developed in Europe of the ""Polish plumber"" – a foreign tradesman willing to undercut the prices of local workers. In Britain, newspapers and politicians helped spread the stereotype: The Sun once claimed that most of the population of one Polish city had moved to Britain (which prompted a threat of legal action from the city itself, angered by its negative description of the city). The United Kingdom Independence Party ran advertisements that read, ""British workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labor,"" thoughthey were criticized when it turned out that the actor in the ad was an Irish immigrant.

It'd be hard to deny that there was some truth to the stereotype. There really did seem to be plenty of Polish plumbers, builders and other tradesmen in Britain not long after 2004, and they were soon followed by Romanians, Bulgarians and other new Europeans. Politicians were later forced to admit that they never predicted the huge numbers of immigrants from Eastern Europe who would travel to Britain, nor the effect that would have on some British citizens.

However, it was always a simplification. Even early on, experts argued that the arrival of Poles and other nationalities had been a boon to Britain's economy. ""This influx has benefited a wide swathe of regions and industries … by increasing the flexibility of the economy and spreading the burden on housing and local services,"" professor Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the Item Club, told the Telegraph in 2006. Another study from 2014found that migrants contributed $7 billion more to the British economy than they cost in welfare.

And as more and more Polish people lived in Britain, cultures inevitably became intertwined. British people would shop at Polish stores, eat at Polish restaurants, perhaps even marry a Polish person. Many went on vacations to places like Krakow and Warsaw. Some even chose to live in Poland: In one unusual reversal of stereotypes, there was even a British citizen living in Poland who claimed state benefits. A survey of British attitudes toward Polish immigrants from 2014 found that negative feelings were not in the majority, with 55 percent saying Poles worked hard and 52 percent saying they contributed to Britain.

Right now, it's unclear what sort of immigration relationship will continue between the two nations. While much of the rhetoric ahead of Britain's referendum on E.U. membership had hinged on immigration, ""leave"" campaign leaders have already begun admitting that they may not push a hard line. ""We can control our own borders in a way that is not discriminatory but fair and balanced, and take the wind out of the sails of the extremists and those who would play politics with immigration,"" Boris Johnsonsaid Friday.

0,"&gt; But they did, that is what history shows.

No, it definitely does not show that. You are sloppily picking and choosing different points in time to back up your argument without any context. 

&gt; People left the farms and moved to the cities and took factory jobs. No one forced this on them. 

In which country? Also, just because they voluntarily left the farms to go to cities for higher paying factory jobs does not mean they had the option of owning and controlling their own factories. Think about how those factories came to be. Who borrowed money and/or invested to finance the creation of those factories? Where did that money come from? Capital had already become privately owned by a small group of people by that time. 

&gt; That exact thing happens today in the 3rd world as they increase industrialization, in places where historic farming communities suddenly have the option of factory work, and they love factory work

Again, just because they voluntarily left the farms to go to cities for higher paying factory jobs does not mean they had the option of owning and controlling their own factories. Think about how those factories came to be. Who borrowed money and/or invested to finance the creation of those factories? Where did that money come from? Capital had already become privately owned by a small group of people by that time. 

&gt; China industrialized significantly in our lifetime, doing this exact thing. Their income has gone from $300 / year on average as poor peasant farmers, to $10,000 / year as capitalist workers.

You are making the argument that the people of China are better off today as a result of industrialization and working in factories than they were when they were working in farms, I'm not disagreeing with you. But none of this addresses my point. In order to successfully argue that capitalism came about as a choice that people made centuries ago, you need to show evidence that capitalism originated because the majority of people chose wage labor over ownership and control of land despite having both options available to them. This is the only way that you can draw a legitimate parallel between the transition to capitalism from feudalism and the transition to agrarian society from hunter-gathering. Otherwise, that comparison is nonsense. 

&gt; That they actual prefer poverty in farming? How about poverty in hunter-gathering?

Now you're just engaging in straw man arguments. And not even very creative ones. 

&gt;  I don't even need to resort to that, as China and India, an the rest of the world are not Britain or Europe, yet all chose capitalism all the same, and without being forced.

Hold on there. Not so fast. Capitalism originated in Britain in the 14th century. That's where your argument should be focused. By focusing on China or India, you cannot make an effective argument for people choosing wage labor over worker-ownership and control, because capitalism spread to India and China from the west. You cannot say that people in India ""chose capitalism"" just because it ended up there - in China, for example, the factories that started being built and jobs that started being created as a result of liberalization were a result of capitalists starting to invest in China. The Chinese and Indians never had the option of choosing worker-ownership and control over wage labor, since all the job opportunities that were created were a result of capitalists investing in those countries. It's not as though the capitalism in China or India is a homegrown capitalism that came as a result of the Chinese and Indians choosing wage labor over being worker-owners. 

&gt; In China they were all individual land owners. The farming was too hard to be done for an absentee landowner, so they've always had a long tradition of individual farm ownership. They didn't have wheat and other crops that could be planted by A and harvested by B as serfs. Farming rice requires a truly diligent worker, and the harvest can be greatly magnified by additional attention and work.
Yet they became capitalist. Because it's more productive than agriculture, and they chose it. 

I am not disagreeing with you that income from working in a factory is higher than income from working in agriculture.

Actually, they started importing western capitalism in the form of investment by opening up their economy to foreign capitalists. They imported western capitalism itself, not simply the ""norms and ways"". 

&gt; It's not a moral argument at all, it's a historic one. I say if you're looking for someone to blame because of the fact that you can't easily become a hunter gatherer or farmer anymore, you should blame the people that actually did have that choice and chose the way you no longer seem to like, not the people who continue to choose it today.

You have yet to prove the accuracy of that parallel between the transition from HG to agrarianism and the transition to capitalism. The only way you can do so is by making an argument about what happened in 14th century Britain. 

&gt; Here you go, it's a study out of Stanford. And it's not 12%, it's 14% lower. My bad..

That study analyzed the wage gap over an 8 year period (1984 to 1992) in Italy and it did indeed show that the worker cooperatives paid 14% lower than the capitalist firms. However, that doesn't mean worker cooperatives have a general tendency to pay less than capitalist firms. For example, [another study in Uruguay (see page 523)](http://disjointedthinking.jeffhughes.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Burdin-Dean-2009.-New-evidence-on-wages-and-employment-in-worker-cooperatives-compared-with-capitalist-firms.pdf) shows that between 1996 and 2002, worker cooperatives paid 5-15% more than capitalist firms. 

&gt; No, it's because the people who invest capital want to maximize their return, and thus aren't going to invest in a coop that produces inferior returns to a capitalist structure.

You've just reworded what I said. No capitalist will not invest in cooperatives, because cooperatives by their design put dividends in the control of workers rather than paying them out to capitalists. Therefore, it is not as profitable for a capitalist to invest in a cooperative. 

&gt;  Profits come after paying wages. 

I am aware. 

&gt;  Profits come after paying wages. And workers in the US often the same shareholders you're talking about. There's no law that workers cannot own shares, and with profit-sharing and stock-buy-in agreements, lots of workers own stock, most people are invested in the market at some level. What now.

""What now"" lol. As if you've just scored a touchdown or something. Let me bring you back down to reality with the fact that 1% of the population owns over 60% of all business equity in America. And less than half of Americans own any stock at all. 

&gt; If you didn't have a ""surplus"" to give the capitalists a return on their investment in the capital, the capital would not be available to workers, who would then be extremely poor.

No. If workers had retained ownership/control over the surplus, then they could invest that themselves to expand production. There was never any utility in having a group of owners separate from the workers. 

&gt; It's easy. By working for a capitalist who owns a machine, you get to use the machine, your productivity goes up and thus your wage is higher, even with the capitalist taking some off the top, than if you tried to work with no machine.

That's a false dichotomy. 

&gt; In short, a man working with a $2 billion chip-fab can make a lot more chips at far higher quality and earn a much higher income than if he were trying to lay circuits with the tools he has in his own garage.

That's a false dichotomy. 

&gt; If you can't understand that, there is no hope for you. 

If you can't simply argue your points without making snide comments in the middle, then ""there's no hope for you.""

&gt; By definition, all capital is unconsumed wages that were saved to buy capital.

All capital comes from the investment of funds that came from profit. Profit is surplus income withheld from workers. The point is that there is no utility in having a separate group of owners who own and control that surplus. That surplus can be saved and invested on behalf of the workers themselves. 

&gt; Workers can save and buy capital too, if they just lower their consumption to under their earnings. 

Yes, they can, but that is beside the point. They shouldn't have to buy capital from savings from their wages in order to have capital ownership in the first place.

Again, why would you want to invest any kind of capital into the UK when you're not sure what their trade agreements will be with other nations. Sure, Europe isn't the only country on Earth.

One reason why people would want to set up capital in the UK is for the benefit of: 1) being in the UK 2) having access to the rest of the EU. Whatever one country gets, ***the rest offer*** in terms of trade agreements. So if you have set up a trade agreement with Germany, you can trade with every single one of the other countries in the EU as they all have the same trade rules, regulations and laws. That's the benefit of the trade bloc. 

If you make a TV in the UK, it already has all the regulations and laws to go to the rest of the EU. 

Now that they UK is ***out*** of the EU, it is now completely uncertain what those rules and regulations will be in regards to the rest of the EU. 

Therefore ***new*** capital is afraid of investing in the UK and who can blame them. It's really quite simple. Why invest in the UK when you can just go to Germany and get a better deal, especially if you were to build a factory. 

&gt; Hmm, I'm more inclined to say that Southern Europe will not enter an economic boom for the next 12 years at least so leaving the eu it isn't much of a loss.

Except for the crashing pound for starters. The longer they take on separating from the EU, the worse it's going to be. Absolutely no trade negotiations with the EU will happen until Article 50 is invoked and the UK has made good on their move from the EU. Only then will negotiations for trade even start. Which means no one is going to want to invest capital into the UK until then. Major companies have already said that.

The regulations the UK tried to get out of will likely ***still*** be imposed. They will ***not*** get complete control of their boarders because of the terms the EU puts on being able to tap into their trade bloc. The UK will ***still*** have to pay the EU a fee for being part of trade bloc too. You know what the best part about all of this is?

Now they do not have a say ***at all*** in what the EU does. Not to mention all the major players that wanted to leave the EU are now fucking backing out and running away. Boris Johnson, the poster child for the Brexit campaign? He's fucking gone lol. He's not taking control and he was so excited the day before the vote! Enough to suggest it's the UK's independence day lololololololol.

Do you really think they were fighting to remain rather than fighting fascists and racists that were organizing and trying to grow their political power? 

Almost all the anarchists and leftists I know hate the EU, just like we hate things like the TPP and NAFTA. We want to see the power of these international neo-liberal financial institutions destroyed. But if the act which seemingly does so means empowering authoritarians, fascists and racists, then we're not going to support that act. 

For instance, I live in the south. If my state decided to secede, it wouldn't make me or mine more powerful. No, it would make the right wing racist christian conservatives and the crony business that support them more powerful. So, as much as I hate the neo-liberal U.S., and as much secession would hurt it, I wouldn't support it because it would weaken the power of individuals and communities that I am a part of. So of course I would fight it -- but not in the name of the U.S., but in the name of fighting people who see me and mine as an inherent threat that needs to be weakened and attacked.

0,"By the end of the 19th century, the US conquered the West and there were no place to expand power.  Also, there was a problem with financing imperialist wars.  There was no federal income tax and there was no central bank to print up money and buy up government bonds. All the federal government had was some customs taxes and ability to borrow from the market competing with businesses that needed credit. If they borrowed heavily, for example for a war the interest rates would go up and crash the economy immediately. Thus the US had a tiny army.

In 1913 the Fed was created and the federal income tax was established.

This gave the ability to finance the US government to build up an army and enter the WW1. There was a big opposition to US entering a war between European powers but that could be massaged away wth propaganda.  The real issue was money.

So with this new tools of financing the US enters the war, which at that point was a stale mate, and tips the balance to the favor the allies.  This causes the lopsided treaty of Versailles. The Fed also caused and prolonged the Great Depreassion and this, coupled with reparations of Versailles treaty, created economic havoc in Germany with hyperinflation.

This caused the rise of the National Socialists and Hitler.

The creation of the Fed caused the second world war and the rise of Hitler. Among many other things.

I listed several non-White empires. And I can sit here all day and list tons more.

&gt;How many former Mongolian subjects speak Mongolian?

This is about all of latin america - Brazil speaking Spanish isn't it. Most of them are partially descened from Europeans.

&gt;much wider and much more effective

You keep bringing up the Mongol empire, but its just one on a super long list. How about the early Muslim conquests? These people spread from a single area in the middle east to the entire middle east and north africa. They killed all who refused to convert. They destroyed history and made everyone speak Arabic. To get all pissed over western empires doing the same and not about all these other empires is undeniably hypocritical. Do you think the Muslim conquest of the middle east, north africa, central asia and asia minor is not wide and effective?

&gt;Also, out of 1.6 billion Muslims, only 100,000 at most are involved with ISIS. And let's say, a million or so Muslims are ISIS sympathizers.

https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/articles/opinion-polls.aspx

Also regarding the 100,000 statistic, where do you think ISIS gets all of its money, weapons, resources, etc? From other muslims who support the shit they're doing, but won't do it themselves to keep their ""moderate"" image, primarliy Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other rich gulf states, and probably Israel too, considering that ISIS says god tells them not to fight Jews.

&gt;That's right, ""we're claiming this land and civilizing these savages in the name of God!""

While religion was definately a factor in the Spanish empire, so too were politics and economics. Muslims exanded because their religion told them to. Also the crusades were fought in retaliation to Muslims attempting to invade Europe.

&gt;KKK:

The KKK doesn't exist anymore. Anybody who claims they're the KKK is likely some FBI plant or Jew trying to stir shit. Even that storm roof kid said it himself, there is no real KKK anymore. And even assuming that the KKK does exist, can it's modern inception in America be compared to the horrific crimes of ISIS in the middle east? To say 'not all muslims' regarding ISIS (especially when the statistic prove otherwise) but demonize christians regarding the fucking KKK shows a massive hole in your logic, exposing it's bias against anything and everything European.

&gt;Implying the Ottoman Empire is evil.

That you think the Ottoman Empire is not evil shows a reasonable view of history as a whole. In history, humans build empires. All humans. But to think that it is somehow different (that it is evil) when and only when Europeans do it (and not always very well, Portugals empire was shit, they mainly had only trading ports, and Brazil, but they didn't keep it for long, their strength was navigation not empire building), once again, shows a bias towards western civilization. If you truly think that building empires is bad, and you think that it is horrible what Europeans did in the New World, then you would also think the same of Ottomans or any other empires, and clearly you do not.

&gt;And don't give me that whole, ""everyone else would have done the same thing if they were in Europe's position"" excuse. China could have very easily colonized South Asia, Southeast Asia, parts of Central Asia, and even parts of Africa in the early 1400's... but they chose not to and decided that trading with neighbors was better than destroying your neighbors and making up phony excuses.

Almost any people would have done the same thing had they been in Europe's position of an extremely advanced culture and economic abundance. To use China as a single example out of tons of other non-White empires is to neglect these empires' existence. Look at some groups that DID have the strong culture and economic abundancy that the Europeans had, such as the early Islamic caliphates. They were in the same position, or arguably even a better position, and they exploited it to the best of their abilities. In fact, ANY empire, would need to be in a position similar to or better than that of Europe's to even build an empire in the first place. Armies require a sound economy and a effective flow of resources, managing colonies/territories requires a sound government.

&gt;trading with neighbors was better than destroying your neighbors

0,"&gt; First question, just to get this out of the way, is there any idea on the agreed upon height range for Nords - males and females both? For instance, would the shortest height for a Nord be 5'9"" to 5'10"" or something that typically isn't considered short such as 6'0"" or 6'1""? Also, would a Nord that's in the first range lists - the 5'9 - 5'10"" range be seen as out of place among the Nords who are typically the tallest of the races of Men, only towered over by the Altmer and Orsimer - the Altmer moreso of course?

Nords are as varied in height as, say, any typical population of Northern Europeans. Look at the height range in Sweden or Denmark and that's what you can expect. They're taller on average than the other TES Humans, but not always towering. 

&gt; For the next few questions, I'm curious about some aspects of Nordic culture in their home province. I know that Julianos was/is called Jhunal - the Nordic Rune God and god of hermetic orders - to the Nordic Pantheon, however, he's said to have fallen out of favor of most, if not all, Nords. Are there any Nords who still respect, revere, or worship Jhunal or Julianos (whichever name they prefer) anywhere? I imagine any Nord that's part of the Mages Guild (before its dissolution) or College of Winterhold (especially before the Great Collapse and Thalmor's rise) would probably do so if they're the religious sort. 

Julianos and all the Imperial gods got really popular after the events of TES IV: Oblivion. Talos had always been popular [(source)](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Reflections_on_Cult_Worship) but the apotheosis of Martin meant that even gods like Jhunal who had died out long ago got some new devotees. In fact, Julianos shrines exist in both Windhelm and Solitude. 


&gt; Speaking of which, what about Nords in Skyrim who aren't particularly religious? Say a Son of Skyrim who doesn't really care about the banning of Talos or the idea of earning glory in Shor's name. Would there be a stigma against them in the eyes of other Nords? 

Agnosticism isn't really much of an option in Tamriel. Even Nords who aren't particularly devout make minor invocations to Shor and Kyne, casually, during hardship.

&gt; In addition, from what I've observed in ESO at least, Nords can either have a very faint accent, non-existent, very heavy accent that seems almost Russian in tone, to the typical accent one hears from such Nords as Ralof in TES V: Skyrim. By any chance are accents in Skyrim regional, or would it just be a matter of who they're raised alongside and a matter of the individual if an accent sticks or just what manner of accent they develop wherever they live?

Probably meant to be regional, but poorly implemented so far, especially in *Skyrim*. 

&gt; Now for something a bit more fun, question-wise. Magic related topics... As is the trend among the Nords of the Fourth Era, magic is frowned upon and loathed greatly thanks to a combination of the Oblivion Crisis, Thalmor, Great Collapse (especially for anyone living in Winterhold), and because many associate magic with Elves in general - yet magic is still respected, studied, and used. However, are there any notes in the lore or any theories as to just how prominent or developed magic was before Shalidor's efforts hindered the production of many future mages due to his beliefs that were the opposite of Galerion's regarding who should be able to learn and use it? How about before the Oblivion Crisis and Thalmor's rise? 

Mages must have been very common among the ancient Nords. Look at all the Draugr who cast frost spells, and the Dragon Priests. The Forbidden Legend questline in *Skyrim* is all about the family of a powerful Archmage from early on in the nation's history. It's safe to say magic used to be widespread and commonly taught. 

&gt; Finally, we come to a question or two about the legendary Shalidor - one of the greatest magic users to have existed in Tamriel, and arguably the greatest HUMAN wizard to have graced the land. Some argue about a couple of his accomplishments, namely the idea of him stealing the 'secret of life' from Akatosh - but just how powerful is the man? In addition, we know through ESO that he was very obsessed with his research, and that he seemed to have vast knowledge on just about any magic-related subject. But... this is something I've been curious about - is there a chance Shalidor had knowledge pertaining to necromancy?

He was clearly powerful enough to keep his personal identity many years after his physical demise, so that's something. He may have understood the mechanics of Necromancy spells, but I doubt he practiced Necromancy. That was a taboo even during his day.

I would argue that the current events with Brexit and Trump running for president are another example of us merging with a parallel universe. In this universe, the EU doesn't exist. The reason we don't see something happening all of the sudden with no real explanation is where my theory really comes in; rather than being a complete, sudden change it is slow and drawn out. The universe gradually compensates for the shift in realities by creating actual memorable events to explain things. Brexit is the first step in dissolving the EU, and when Trump becomes president he will aggravate this further with his push for more nationalism, conservatism, and xenophobia. This brings me to my next point. Perhaps, the merge has already happened and we are all living in the past.

I didn't see a single high-profile debate where voters were called racist. I saw reasonable arguments for and against and then the Boris-Gove brigade of meme-powered votes #ProjectFear #TakeBackControl.

Having said that, it's clear a lot of people weren't voting about the EU, they were voting for a halt on immigration. From listing to QT extra last night, I do believe a lot of these people are actually racist. They don't want non 'ethnically British' people in the country. They want lebenspraum and privileged opportunities for ethnically British people. Without their votes, the EU vote may have gone a different way. This is part of the reason brexiteers are so defensive now - not because they individually are racist, but because the campaign they voted for leveraged the racist vote to win. Not a club most people want to be in. 

Finally, as with most politicians, academics, economists and business owners leaving the EU is bad for all of us. So even with the referendum lost that doesn't mean the campaigning and discussion stops. We don't just roll over and let the right wing of the tory party chart the country's future for the next half century - we push back. We provide debate, we examine what the future relationship should be like.

In the end its all about how certain players handle the pressure and there is no real advantadge about shooting first.

Since the change of format and name from European Cup to Champions League there has been 7 finals decided by penalties.

1. 1996 - Juve won shooting SECOND against Ajax.
2. 2001 - Bayern Munich won shooting FIRST against Valencia.
3. 2003 - AC Milan won shooting SECOND against Juve.
4. 2005 - Liverpool won shooting SECOND against AC Milan
5. 2008 - Man United won shooting FIRST against Chelsea.
6. 2012 - Chelsea won shooting SECOND against Bayern Munich.
7. 2016 - Real Madrid won shooting FIRST against Atlético.

So its 4-3 in favour of shooting last.

In World Cup finals there has been only 2 decided by penalties:

1. 1994 - Brazil won shooting SECOND against Italy.
2. 2006 - Italy won shooting FIRST against France.

In this case its 50/50.

In Euros, there has been only 1 final decided by penaltis:

1. 1976 - Czechoslovakia won shooting FIRST against Germany.

And in Copa America Chile has won shooting first but if I remember correctly Brazil won in 2004 against Argentina shooting last.

In the Europa League, Sevilla has won 2 of their titles from the penalti shootout, one shooting last against Benfica and one shooting first against Espanyol.

Sorry, one bollock, you are wrong. The vote would go up, if anything as the democrat remainers switched sides.

They'd have voted to leave. Its really simple - like you say they voted on the basis of reducing immigration and cutting ties. So that now must happen.

0,"You can never totally eliminate lag, as it is the manifestation of the time it takes the data you send to reach a server (and possibly for the server to send a reply). To ""totally eliminate it"" you would need to be able to instantaneously transfer information from one point to another, which would mean breaking the speed of light and most physics as we know it. 

Instead, you can minimize it in several ways. Large scale stock market traders will often move as close to the server as they physically can get, since less distance = less travel time. This probably isn't an option for you. For most consumers, the best you can do is look for an ISP that offers high upload/download speeds. Play using Ethernet rather than WiFi when possible, as WiFi slows you down a but further. Also, make sure you choose the server closest to you when playing a game if possible. If I live in Europe, I'm not going to choose a server in Australia, as then I'd have to send information all the way across the world and back which will take a long time and create lots of lag. Instead I'll choose a European server - preferably one in my country. 

When you get jumpiness or unresponsiveness in games, what's happening (in a very simplified way) is this: there are two parts. The client (you) and the server (some big computer owned by blizzard or valve or whoever runs the game you're playing). The server maintains the world of the game, and sends info to the client (you and other players) about what it looks like. It refreshes this information at a very fast rate. Now let's say you want to take an action and move. You press a key, and your client shows you starting to move. At the same time, the client sends information to the server saying ""this person is now moving."" The server then updates your position and it then sends out the new information with your updated position back to the clients. 

The trouble arises when the signal you send is really slow (bad connection, poor upload speeds, a server across the world, etc will all cause this). Let's say it takes two seconds for a signal your client sends to reach the server (a really long time as signal travel time is typically measured in milliseconds - literally a thousandth of a second). You press a button to move. On your screen, your client shows you starting to move. But then, since your signal is still travelling to the server, the server sends out an update on where it thinks your position is, that is, in your starting position. Server information typically overrides client information to prevent abuse and certain kinds of hacking in game, so your client reupdates your position to be back at your starting point, causing the snapback or ""rubber banding"" people typically see as lag. Then your signal saying you moved reaches the server, and it either decides that the signal is junk (he can't have moved as far as the client says he has, he's still at his start point beginning to move) and throws it out (causing repeated rubber banding as your client sends more signals of movement) **or** it accepts your client's message that you've started moving, makes you start to move, and sends that signal back to you (resulting in situations where you press a key, wait several seconds, and then your character starts to move).",1467361151,False,t5_2rjo5,IWantToLearn,,2,Charadin,0,1467360154,1471131671,2,,t3_4qpzcr,t3_4qpzcr,,d4v3mvf

Why exactly? 

Also, there hasn't been years of ""printing at zero interest rate"". Money supply  isn't created AT a specific interest rate. It INFLUENCES the interest rate. Not the same thing. 

***

&gt;  In my middling understanding of things, the interest rate is a mechanism to gauge risk, and keeping it artificially at zero tampers that mechanism.

Not exactly. That's what the [risk premium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_premium) is. 

&gt;  it seems like this is setting us up for long term stagflation.

Why? 

Stagflation is caused by a supply-side sock (so, [cost-push effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-push_inflation)), it hasn't got much to do with what's going on today with the current economic cycle (which is a demand-side shock). 

So how is it exactly that a demand-side shock will SOMEHOW give rise to a supply-side shock? 

***

&gt; Why shouldnt we be worried at least a little?

The economic and financial worlds have indeed spent a great deal of time worrying that the demand-side shock would get more and more profound.

There are 7 classes of ADHD medications, 6 of them do not cause liver damage.

One of the classes of ADHD medications **can cause liver damage** but it very rarely does, and it is a freak occurrence (literally a 1 in a million occurrence most likely but if we were to take the least likely number it would be 1 in several hundrend thousand see numbers below).  If you show any signs of elevated liver enzymes while on this medication, you stop the medication, and your liver will heal itself within a 6 week period due to how livers work.  All of these patients who showed liver issues on that 1 medicine showed signs of the liver problems prior to doing blood tests, the blood tests confirm the liver issues, and when they discontinue the medicine they got better.

------

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Technical doctor stuff about that one type of ADHD medication, called Strattera (Atomoxetine) in regards to Liver Injury.

Severe Liver Injury

&gt;Postmarketing reports indicate that STRATTERA can cause severe liver injury. **Although no evidence of liver injury was detected in clinical trials of about 6000 patients**, there have been rare cases of clinically significant liver injury that were considered probably or possibly related to STRATTERA use in postmarketing experience. Rare cases of liver failure have also been reported, including a case that resulted in a liver transplant. Because of probable underreporting, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate of the true incidence of these reactions. Reported cases of liver injury occurred within 120 days of initiation of atomoxetine in the majority of cases and some patients presented with markedly elevated liver enzymes [ &gt; 20 X upper limit of normal (ULN)], and jaundice with significantly elevated bilirubin levels ( &gt; 2 X ULN), **followed by recovery upon atomoxetine discontinuation. In one patient**, liver injury, manifested by elevated hepatic enzymes up to 40 X ULN and jaundice with bilirubin up to 12 X ULN, recurred upon rechallenge, **and was followed by recovery upon drug discontinuation**, providing evidence that STRATTERA likely caused the liver injury. Such reactions may occur several months after therapy is started, but laboratory abnormalities may continue to worsen for several weeks after drug is stopped. **The patient described above recovered from his liver injury, and did not require a liver transplant.**

&gt;STRATTERA should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or laboratory evidence of liver injury, and should not be restarted. Laboratory testing to determine liver enzyme levels should be done upon the first symptom or sign of liver dysfunction (e.g., pruritus, dark urine, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, or unexplained “flu like” symptoms) [see Laboratory Tests; PATIENT INFORMATION].

http://www.rxlist.com/strattera-drug/warnings-precautions.htm

Now those case of liver damage were only occurred when they did 4.3 million patients over a 4 year period.  Hepatic means liver problems see the quoted area

&gt;In the manufacturer's database, atomoxetine was a ""probable cause"" of three hepatic adverse events (AEs) (all reversible hepatitis), and 133 hepatic AEs had possible confounding factors and were ""possibly related"" to atomoxetine, during 4 years when atomoxetine exposure had reached about 4.3 million patients. Rare cases of severe liver injury are described in the US label and European SPC; a case requiring liver transplantation is described in the US label.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27290715

So put another way, out of 4 million cases, liver damage only occurred in 3 cases out of the 4 million caused by Strattera.  Now there were another 133 cases where Atomoxetine / Strattera may have been a contributing factor but there was some other medication or some form of liver injury (alcohol, certain viruses, etc) that is also partly responsible or the main factor in the liver issues.",False,False,t5_2qnwb,ADHD,,9,roland00,0,1467362252,1471131976,9,,t1_d4v3dt8,t3_4qqglq,,d4v4a3g

Divine Right wasn't absolute and ""watery tarts hurling scimitars"" was no basis for a form of government.  In fact, Europeans had to literally sail an ocean away before the idea ever really took root outside of Denmark.

0,"&gt; the very visible clusters

Appearance has nothing to do with total variation. The physical insides of our bodies do happen to be a bit larger than our surface characteristics. The genes that determine the skin colour of people are countable on two hands, compared to the 24000 genes in total, quite irrelevant. In the total genome there are no clusters which could be called ""races"" (there are some clusters but unless you are willing to accept Euro-African, yes both continents, and North Indian and Dravian as ""races"" you may have problems accepting those).

Haplogroups prove that races don't exist. In fact if we were to classify humanity according to haplogroups (which is quite possible and scientifically valid) we end up with about 56 different groups. To date I still have to meet someone who on first hearing of those 56 groups thinks ""race"", but if you want to define that for yourself as ""races"" and confuse every human you talk to, I can't stop you.

The idea that certain regions of the world have groups of people more inclined to education or crime is laughable and signifies that you know absolutely squat about evolutionary biology. The human species is a sexually reproducing species which means that beneficial adaptations (in the sense of reproduction of course) will always rise to saturation (100% presence) in the population. Regions with stupid people would have been invaded by smarter people and stupid people would have been bred out of existence. You cannot claim that that is what happened in the colonial period because cross continental migration already happened for thousands of years. Any intelligence difference would have long since disappeared. Europeans just happened to have more natural start up capital, the societies flourished faster and rich people can conquer. In addition the Europeans just happened to live on the continent that is the furthest from the equator which is why they developed lighter skin. When conquering skin colour proved to be a useful shorthand for discriminating between Europeans and subordinate peoples and this was merely formalized in the Frankenstein like concept of ""race"".

This is the EU's raison d'être. It will never, ever, ever compromise on that.

I find it stunning that Leavers accuse Remainers of being elitist while they want to restrict movement for those without an education. The middle class will always be able to move abroad.

Also while the media has had a role in the whole discussion, blaming immigrants for a thing or two ain't all that untrue. The fact is that in all EU countries that provide a surplus to the EU have had issues with immigration. For the simple reason that they don't do anything to limit the amount of people coming from within and outside EU borders. Various workers from Poland are taking jobs from people that are then going to rely on government payouts. And since the Polish are then not paying as much tax as they do it for less, you cut the income and increase the amount you need to spend. As a nation you cannot do anything about that because the EU forced countries to implement certain laws and to sign certain laws to never get around this. It sounded fine as a law in the 80's but now seems terrible. 

And what your government did is not much different from what my government did, but that doesn't mean that the EU has simply nothing to blame. If they got their act together, my government wouldn't have had to cut anything. But its also about the government not supporting all of its citizens that made it this way and (especially in your winner-takes-all system you have) there isn't really something you can do about it. There's a big gap between politicians and the people they represent. And the gap is bigger in the EU.

Now about the 350 million a week, technically one leave-campaign didn't say it exactly. They only said that instead of paying the EU 350 million, we should finance NHS. Not finance NHS with 350 million. And like many others claim that everything leave claimed has been denied or twisted after the vote is simply false. Multiple leave-campaigns and different statements get switched around making people believe that they are taking it back.
And if you would use the same amount of effort for discrediting the leave-camp to the remain-camp you will see that neither side played it nice and things can be said about either. Like the black-Friday they predicted and the immediate financial meltdown hasn't happend yet. Many models they used for predicting how it will end are already wrong. And how about you ignoring the way the EU now wants to circumvent national parliaments for the CETA treaty to prevent the Dutch and others to have any say or referendum about it.

To be honest, the left has dropped the ball and ignored them as well. People have had concerns and rather than addressing them, rather than listening to them the left has concentrated on language policing and demonising the working class as bigots and ""brain dead idiots"".

The EU obviously isn't working for ordinary people and there needs to be some big discussions about reform, but throwing the baby out with the bathwater is not good for Britain.

[Open Letter to FT](http://www.economistsforbrexit.co.uk/open-letter-to-ft)

Summary of views:

- Brexit will result in a better economic outcome than remaining in the EU.

- Economic forecasts (based on proven financial modelling by Patrick Minford) show that on leaving the EU:

- Output grows 2%

- Competitiveness rises 5%

- Real disposable wages up 1.5%

- Exchange rate falls 6%

- Inflation and interest rates rise to 2-3% range

- Current account improves to -1.5% of GDP

- Unemployment reduced by 0.2% (75,000 on benefit count)

The UK does not need to do a trade deal to trade. It already trades extensively with many countries across the globe under the rules of the WTO and can continue to do so with EU countries in the future (in the same way that the US, Japan and China does). Leaving the EU will decrease prices and boost GDP.

**The City of London will retain its role as the world’s leading financial centre outside of the EU.**

The UK is a net contributor to the EU budget and those funds could be utilised far more efficiently elsewhere.

Champions must scale a [multi tiered waterfall](http://imgur.com/2fJ1Nfj) deep within the Amazon Rainforest. 

#####*Objective*  
Starting at the base of the falls, each champion is to escort a [*Hitodama*](http://imgur.com/mjbCE1k)^† to its lantern placed at the top of the waterfall. Champions are to retrieve the lanterns which are inscribed with a map pertaining to the proceeding task--which cannot be read unless illuminated by the [Hitodama's light](http://cdn.trendhunterstatic.com/thumbs/shadow-lamps.jpeg).

&gt;^† Hitodama are wispy, glowing creatures that resemble a floating ball of flame. Native to Japan, these creatures are related to the European Hinkypunk and the Irish Will-o-the-wisp; albeit with notable differences. Rather than carrying a lantern to lure unsuspecting travelers, Hitodama elect to make their dwelling *inside* paper lanterns--most commonly memorial lanterns set out to honor the deceased. Due to this behavior, non-magical Japanese folk associate Hitodama sightings with death. It is claimed by many non-magical people that the ghostly lights are ""[souls of the dead that have separated from their bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitodama)."" As their physical forms are nebulous, they are *extremely labile to water*...

#####*Obstacles*  
Champions are allowed a wand, but are not allowed to Summon anything from outside the arena. 
Aside from the physical challenges presented by protecting a living fireball while ascending a four-tiered waterfall, the falls themselves have been enchanted. If a champion fails to protect their Hitodama from the crashing water or obstacle, he or she will be washed all the way down to the base of the falls to retrieve another Hitodama and resume their task. The arena is also bewitched to prevent champions from skipping tiers via aided flight (broom, carpet, or enchantment), transfigurative flight (enchantment or animagus), and apparition.  Each of the tiers will be riddled with flora and fauna both native and and imported. Champions may expect to encounter both terrestrial and aquatic as the waterfall's tier-pools are varied in depth. Possible combatants may include [Kappas](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Kappa), [Snargaluffs](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Snargaluff), [Venomous Tentaculae](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Venomous_Tentacula), Devil's Snare, [Tengu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengu), [Inkanyamba Cryptids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkanyamba), and Castelobruxo's own fleet of [Caipora](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Caipora). 


#####*Scoring*  
Judges will initially score based on time; the first champion to return their hitodama to its lantern will receive 10 points, the second receives 7, and the third receives 5. Point deductions will be made for every time they are forced to restart. Furthermore, additional points may be awarded for exemplary exhibitions of physical or magical skill.

Das schränkt die Auswahl natürlich deutlich ein bzw. erfordert Kompromisse, aber es ist *nicht hoffnungslos* (siehe unten).

Why on earth would you expect the Lib Dems to stop campaigning for Europe because Leave won?

We live in a multi-party democracy where political parties offer a policy platform to the electorate. It is vital to the health of that democracy that a variety of views and positions are presented to give the voters a choice. It is absolutely absurd to suggest that no party should now campaign for Europe when we know that at least 16 million people are in favour of EU membership.

&gt;Even Kelly, who has just finished a training session on a brand new football pitch, backtracks slightly after asking that question. “Well, I know … they built all this,” he says, and motions his head at the impressive facilities that are all around us. “But we put in more money than we get out, don’t we?”
&gt;We’re standing on the site of the old steelworks, a toxic industrial wasteland left rotting when the plant, once the biggest in Europe, finally closed in 2002. It’s now “The Works” – a flagship £350m regeneration project funded by the EU redevelopment fund and home to the £33.5m Coleg Gwent, where some of the 29,000 Welsh apprenticeships the European Social Fund pays for help young people learn a trade.

0,"The UK is very short on experienced negotiators of for international trade deals. Experienced negotiators are absolutely necessary to avoid negotiating bad deals. The UK does not have the capability to negotiate 10 different trade deals at once.
When the UK actually begins the process to exit the EU, the UK will first be busy negotiating the EU exit itself, and then be busy for several more years negotiating new trade deal with the EU itself (Germany, the Netherlands, and France are UK export countries number 2, 3, and 5), with Switzerland (#4 UK export country), and with the US (#1 UK export country). I'd expect that getting those three negotiated, but not even signed, will take at least 5-10 years. And those alone will require more than the UK's current capacity for negotiating international trade deals.

I'd have a few dozen horror stories available where German cities and towns made their own deals with banks or with international investors, but did not have the necessary experience at hand. Some of those towns went bankrupt or almost bankrupt simply because they signed horribly bad deals.

0,"**Name:** Benjamin Roe.

**Alignment:** Tweener, mostly leans toward Heel.

**Billed From:** London, England.

**Height:** 6'0"".

**Weight:** 230lbs.

**Character Description:** A very solitary hot head. Roe has always been a bit of recluse and a loner, growing up never having many friends. In school, and even after school, Roe floated around and never accomplished much. Mostly held back by his short temper and being prone to getting into fights. Roe was considered a burnout loser by those who knew him, until one day in 2013, he got into a fight with a veteran of the wrestling industry. After the altercation, the vet saw potential in the then 22 year old Benjamin Roe and told him to come train to be a wrestler.

After being fired from yet another job, Roe took all the money he had and decided to take the man he met up on his offer and began training to be a pro wrestler. Roe quickly discovered that he was meant for this industry and set himself a new goal. To be the very best. Now that he has signed with WiR after three years of setting the European Independent Wrestling scene on fire with his trademark hard hitting style, Roe is closer than ever to accomplishing that goal.

**Appearance:** Short messy black hair, scruffy facial hair, steely blue eyes. Well built with little muscle definition. Light body hair. White wrist tape. Black trunks, black kneepads, and boots with dark silver kickpads.

**Style:** Hard Hitting, Strong Style influenced offense.

* *Evil Death Roll* - Northern Lights Suplex rolled through into a Deadlift Bridging Northern Lights.

* *Dinard* - Roe connects with a Falcon Arrow, and then lifts his opponent into a seated position. Roe then darts off into the ropes and comes back with a Sliding Forearm to his opponent's face.

**Entrance Music:** [""People Vultures"" by King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard.
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f78_Tf4Tdk)

**Entrance Description:** At the 0:28 second mark, Benjamin Roe steps out onto the entrance stage. He looks around, taking in the reaction and getting a feel for the crowd. Roe pays no mind to the crowd as he marches down toward the ring. He climbs up the steel steps and gets into the ring. He walks over into the corner and stands there, warming up, waiting for the match to start.

**Taunts:** Roe isn't a showman. Every so often, he will get in his opponents face, hurling insults and harsh words.

**Game of Thrones Fan?:** Big fan of Game of Thrones. Jon Snow, Ramsay Bolton and The Hound are the best.

**Other:** Multi time champion in various European independent promotions. Despite being a angry cynical person he rarely lets his emotions get the better of him in a match.

There have been cultural differences, though; from what ive seen (and I admit to not spending much time in America) black Americans self segregate, whereas black British integrate.

From what I've seen of Trump, isn't he one such danger? Sarah Palin scared the life out of me with her...very poor reasoning.

I would argue against that. Your patriotism has led to one or two incidents already, such as the internment of Japanese Americans. Historically, Europe has had nationalism rear its ugly head every century or so. America simply hasn't been around long enough, and perhaps not learnt many lessons from its parent continent, over the dangers of teaching your kids that you are the greatest nation on the planet.

Every country that has ever made that claim has done so with evidence to back it up. The British had the natural superiority of the British Man through his thought and education. Germany made that claim due to their genetic purity. It really depends upon the ideals of the time.

I would argue that America, being the size it is, has little need for expansion. Well, I think the native Americans might have something to say for you taking over that country. I also think the Iraqi people have something to say for what both my and your country did to them (we have an inquiry report coming out soon that may charge our PM at the time with war crimes, and I'm pretty sure it'll reference the American intelligence community as well) 

Indeed, America does have quite a few black marks against it. The use of enhanced information techniques, the My lai massacre, the use of drones and poor intel leading to the deaths of many civilians. I recall watching a video taken from an American helicopter that began firing a minigun at what it assumed were insurgents. It was a van full of children. During this time, ""Fuck yeah! America!"" And other such nationalistic cries could be heard. 

We dont have many cultural differences. or rather, cultural differences are barely noticeable compared to differences between American states. Nationalism is still looked down upon here and will be for as long as people remember the camps, the millions dead, the suffering wrought from others.

&gt;* Flight operations of aircraft 54-01 and 54-02 - the first two received in December 2014 and December 2015 - have been temporarily suspended after inspections found heavy engine wear after only 365 and 189 hours of operations respectively, Der Spiegel reported, adding that engine wear on the third aircraft, 54-03, had also been identified.

&gt;* This issue is likely to be connected to problems that were identified with the EuroProp International (EPI) TP400-D6 engine earlier this year.

_Buy high, sell low._ Waiting for the dusk to settle can be a dangerous phrase. Many people in the 2008/2009 crisis bought at the highs in 2007/2008. Sold at or near the bottom in 2008/2009. But then sat out waiting for the dust to settle while the stock market was returning 25+% per year.

&gt; How will a burst of a bubble in a major Canadian city affect the Canadian dollar?

50% of the population in Canada lives in its 10 largest metropolitan areas. Therefore, if a bubble pops in one or two of Canada's largest cities, it should rock the boat pretty heavily just because we are talking about an event that will bring uncertainty to 10% or more of our entire population (the value of a dollar is mostly based on an aggregate of confidence).

&gt;  Would my money be safer in USD, EUR or RMB? Please give me more information as I'm a newbie to this.

*The key would be to not overly invest in Canada.* Canada is 2% of the world economy. Similar proportion in the world stock market. A model portfolio therefore can have the following shape: 10% in low-volatility bonds or GICs, 2% in Canada, 44% in USA equities, and 44% in European equities.

If the Canadian stock market crashes by 50%, when you rebalance you sell about one hundredth of your USA and European equities. If Europe does, the stocks 'effectively' go on sale for you and when you rebalance, you sell some USA equities to buy the European ones on the cheap. Similar if the USA has a slip.

If you lack the money to split your money four ways (example):

- 10% low-risk assets (Bonds, etc...)
- 3% Canada 
- 87% USA (the USA market is 29x Canada)

If you lack the money to split three ways (example):

- 3% Canada
- 97% USA

If you lack the money to split two ways, for example you put 400$ into the market monthly (example):

- Buy some Canadian equity (recommended an index fund)
- For the next three years only buy USA equities every month (ex. Canadian-listed index funds for the USA)

0,"Haha, sure. 

I guess to start with there'd been some growing racial tension in the UK for the last 10+ years due to immigration, just like in the US. The UK Independence Party started getting more support based on its opposition to immigration and the EU (which they blamed the immigration on) just like Trump is. Although UKIP would never win, their growing support and the fact they were leeching votes from the much bigger Conservative and Labour parties was a concern. So back in 2013 the Prime Minister David Cameron, when running for re-election, promised to hold a public Leave/Remain vote if we voted for him. He won, and so he was obligated to keep that promise and a referendum was planned for 23rd of June. 

Various politicians and celebrities of all sorts of backgrounds declared their support for either Leave or Remain. Remain had the backing of most major politicians and financial experts etc, but Leave had some very loud and animated individuals who tapped into the public's frustration with modern politics and the feeling of isolation from government. Against all expectations, Leave won the vote. Analysis of the votes showed that mostly older and less wealthy voters chose to Leave, while younger and more affluent voters chose Remain. 

Following the vote, David Cameron (who had backed Remain all along) felt he had to resign as he'd spectacularly failed in this whole 'vote for me, and I'll let you vote on the EU, but I hope you vote Remain like I want you to' plan of his. Crucially, he resigned **before** signing the documents you need to actually leave the EU. He basically quit and said ""whoever takes over can be the one to actually deal with the paperwork"". This has caused a total and utter stalemate, as nobody wants to be the person who takes over and starts that process! Boris Johnson, one of the primary campaigners for Leave and the previous favourite to take over from David Cameron announced yesterday that he doesn't want the job anymore and won't be running for election after all. Several other key Conservative politicians have done the same. There are growing calls to hold an entirely new General Election (which isn't currently scheduled until 2020, so would have to be brought forward significantly) just to sort this weird power vaccuum out and we're currently not sure what will happen. 

I guess the US equivalent (assuming you're american) would be if Trump promised that, if elected, he'd hold a public referendum on whether to split America into North and South or East and West halves or something, and the public voted him in, so he held that referendum, and the public against all expectations agreed to it, and then shocked at what he'd actually just done Trump suddenly resigned without doing it and left other people to take over and work out whether they go through with it or not.

&gt; The ramshackle house, which has survived a century of wear and tear and a devastating earthquake in 1934, retains little of its old architectural charm. The large battered wood panels jutting from the tiled roof, a small family well and a house number etched on the wall are the few mark the crumbling edifice.     

&gt; Orwell, né Eric Blair, was the second child of Ida and Richard Walmesley Blair, who worked as sub-deputy agent in the Opium Department of the Indian Civil Service. A massive opium warehouse faces the house, where Orwell spent just one year. Two photographs exist: one of him in his mother’s arms [and another in his ayah’s](http://i.imgur.com/l9UBF57.jpg).  Besides that nothing is known about the family’s life in the district that borders Nepal. “Of all the biographies and articles written about my father, little has been said in relation to his birthplace. This is simply because he left at the age of one. Nevertheless Motihari is a significant part of his story; everything written about him starts at Motihari,” says Richard Blair, Orwell’s son, via e-mail.


His father's 'opium' connection is interesting as well because Motihari is part of East Champaran district, a region from where in 1917 Mahatma Gandhi launched the civil disobedience movement that ultimately resulted, 30 years later, in the departure of the British from India. Gandhi had been moved by the plight of cultivators in Bihar who were being forced to produce opium and indigo for the lucrative markets of China and Europe respectively.

&gt; The house would have turned to rubble were it not for a campaign by a Motihari businessman, Debapriya Mookherjee, to convert it to a memorial.

&gt; ""The people of Motihari do not realise that even if Orwell was an Englishman, he was anti-imperialist and wrote against colonial exploitation,"" said Bishwajeet Mookherjee. ""I made the film to educate Biharis about Orwell, to tell them that a great writer was born in my home town. It's only right that we should honour his memory.""

Unfortunately since you have substrate you're going to be a bit higher than what the calculator predicts.  I figured you were going to let it run for 24 hours before dosing so i didn't go over the fine detail.  Also, a lot of water municipalities in Europe use chloramine for their antimicrobial which essentially is more ammonia.  Don't be surprised if when you test you're over 5ppm if you have chloramine in your water, probably close to 4ppm regardless.

&gt;I'm not sure if I need to add dechlorinator right away or if this should be done later in the process (or maybe with water changes only?)

Dechlorination should always be the first step.  Chlorine and Chloramine are added to the water to keep stuff like your bacteria from growing in it.  My recommendation would be either Seachem Prime or Amquel +.  Both of these products work fast on both chlorine and chloramine, however, both will essentially convert your ammonia to ammonium temporarily, which would protect fish from ammonia poisoning and only very slightly slow down the cycle.  However, don't sweat it too much now.  You haven't added any seed bacteria so having ammonia in it won't hurt or hinder anything, so don't worry that you did things slightly out of order initially.

I'm a Prime guy personally, it's a little more expensive per bottle, but each bottle treats more gallons than Amquel +, so it ends up being cheaper over time as it treats something like 3 times the water per same volume of dechlorinator.

I'm not so sure it's as hard as you make out. Sure, there are a buttload of Europeans who can speak multiple languages, but most of them stay in Europe. Bi-lingualism to a level of fluency is remarkably rare in the UK and Ireland, definitely less than 5%, and the major point was that in those countries, as opposed to on the continent, you don't need a diploma in office management to get a filing and copying job. Languages + an degree + a persuasive cover letter and a strong interview is more than enough to land an entry level job at one of the multi-nationals.

0,"A friend of mine pointed out to me the *brilliant* political manoeuvre that David Cameron has played by making the PM job a poisoned chalice for his opponents.

There is only 3 ways that they can go from here:

* Leave campaigners step up to run and ruin their political career as the UK goes through an incredible recession after invoking Article 50, showing that Remain was right all along.

* Leave campaigners ruin their political career by stepping up to run for PM and NOT invoking Article 50, thereby showing that all their Leave campaigning was Machiavellism at its finest.

* Leave campaigners DON'T step up to run and ruin their political careers (same reason as above).

When you think about it, no one is talking about the promise that Cameron made before this started, where he pledged to lead the country through the negotiations. He broke that promise (by resigning) but no one cares, because *he's already resigned* and there are more important things to worry about. He's essentially untouchable now, because he's gone on record opposing Leave. He has washed his hands of the situation; political capital means nothing to him now because he's a lame duck, and he's already rich enough that it doesn't matter anymore.

On the Conservative Party side, Theresa May, the Home Secretary, is considered to be the frontrunner to be the Tory party leader. She may have campaigned for Remain, but to me, she's a Leave politician in all but name; she wants to remove the European Declaration for Human Rights (for some reason) and has a vision on immigration that is too similar to Nigel Farage's for my liking (last I heard she wants to expel **ALL 'FOREIGNERS'** from the UK, even British citizens who aren't white).

Michael Gove...well...it's Michael Gove. Enough said. The man thinks that just because he has a strong opinion on the matter is more than enough for him to tackle the problem. And he made a complete hash of it during his time as the Education Secretary.

Boris Johnson certainly didn't believe in Leave; he only joined Leave because he thought it was his best chance of being Prime Minister (I can't imagine that he would've wanted to be the most public face of Leave if he didn't have support), but that political career is (temporarily) over because Michael Gove stabbed him in the back, so he pulled out to salvage what remained of his career and perhaps try again later in a few years.

Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is in trouble because he supported Leave indirectly (at odds but the rest of his primarily pro-EU party). I've seen a few articles mention 'mismanagement of Remain', but very few seem to realise that he was personally for Leave, so he assumed that Remain would win without him needing to do anything, allowing him to attempt to sway Leave voters with anti-EU rhetoric in the upcoming general election. However, Leave won, and so his perceived lack of effort in doing anything is being highlighted with a magnifying glass.

What is it other than your fears which inform your certainty of this outcome?

It is very likely that EU residents already residing here will be granted permanent leave to remain. EU nationals make up about ~6% of the workforce. Nobody will take a disastrous approach to uproot this. Not only is it in nobodies interest or the national interest, it would be unaffordable to implement even if we ignore the economic lose it would incur... and this is generally speaking.

Look I don't want to get into an argument I just want to understand your point of view. A lot of ballax was being spewed out by both campaigns and none of them had any sort of solid idea on what they were doing.

So my point of view as an educated voter was: leaving the EU would cause economic instability, poas a threat to current and future jobs including my own and make it more difficult for me to travel to the EU, and potentially plunge us into a recession. Hence why I voted the way I voted.

&gt; Britain's high commissioner is open to signing a free trade deal with Canada ... former Conservative cabinet minister Pierre Poilievre said Friday the Liberal government should ""immediately conclude"" a trade deal with Britain, but that would be a difficult task given the country remains a member of the EU for the foreseeable future — at least two years — as it hammers out an exit strategy.

""that would be a difficult task"" is politics speak for ""unlikely to happen"".

0,"Me he registrado tan solo para escribir lo que sigue, porque **me duele en el alma ver como trolean a la buena gente**, tal como han hecho tantas veces en la historia de la llamada ""transición"".

Todas las actitudes y comportamientos ""extraños"" tienen una causa que produce ese efecto, y la actitud de las ""cúpulas"", cuando no son claras, lógicas y entendibles por las personas dotadas de sentido común y CI normal obedecen a algún tipo de causa oculta.

Para empezar, la pregunta correcta sería ¿cuando no ha habido pucherazo/trampas en este país? Acabaríamos antes.

Hay que tener en cuenta que antes de la era informática, ¡¡¡los muertos votaban!!! Si, se ha sabido, se ha publicado, y no ha pasado nada. ¿No lo saben los licenciados en ciencias políticas? ¿No saben que el procedimiento marcado por la ley electoral se lleva incumpliendo sistemáticamente desde hace ni se sabe? No se trata de la Ley de Hont, sino de agujeros de seguridad acojonantes que aunque los de a pie no veamos, los expertos en política SI deben saber y ver, y en consecuencia denunciar.

Ahora vamos a retroceder un poco atrás en el tiempo, hasta las últimas elecciones europeas, si, las que significaron el pelotazo de PODEMOS.

En esas fechas estaba en el centro del huracán el tema de Bankia, Blesa, las preferentes y el juez Elpidio Silva, que no paraba de salir en los debates dando caña y poniendo el foco con bastante solvencia y contundencia donde realmente era necesario. Fundó el partido RED y se presentó a las elecciones. 

En esos días Podemos no salía en ningún medio porque se acababa de fundar, a nivel nacional se conocía a Pablo Iglesias como tertuliano habitual del debate de La Sexta, pero nada más. El que realmente era un problema era el juez ...

**Ese juez**, aparte de los simpatizantes que obtuviera por sus actuaciones y programa electoral, **tenía el apoyo a muerte de todos los afectados por la estafa de las preferentes, más de 800.000**. Pero llega el día del escrutinio y **solo consigue 130.000 votos ¿?**, que se tradujo en CERO ESCAÑOS. Y que casualidad, Podemos, obtuvo CINCO ESCAÑOS!!! Los medios ignoraron al juez y se volcaron con Podemos y su relación con el 15M como razón para su espectacular subidón. **Pero, ¿fue eso lo que realmente ocurrió?**

**¿Donde fueron los votos de los afectados por las preferentes?** ¿al PPSOE, que no movieron un dedo por su causa? ¿Quizá se olvidaron de tomar la medicación y decidieron no votar ese día y dar la espalda a la persona que decían apoyar a muerte y que se jugó su trabajo por la causa? ... 

O lo que pudo presuntamente ocurrir fue sencillamente un pucherazo destinado a desactivar al juez, que era el problema grave que tenía el régimen en ese momento (y no tanto por el tema Bankia/preferentes, sino el tema Banco Miami). Le quitamos los votos a RED y se los damos a los nuevos de Podemos. Ya habrá tiempo de desactivarlos más adelante ...

Al día siguiente y en lo sucesivo, los medios ya no hablaban del juez (que fue olvidado de la noche a la mañana), sino del ""impresionante"" resultado de Podemos, y así hasta ahora. Los votantes del partido RED se olieron algo raro, pero como inmediatamente los medios empezaron a dar la matraca con Podemos, supongo que valoraron que lo importante al fin y al cabo era una opción que acabara con el bipartidismo, y Podemos parecía que cumplía el papel. 

La jugada maestra sería presuntamente enmascarar los indicios del pucherazo contra RED con el pelotazo de Podemos, y al mismo tiempo, tener a Podemos cogidos por los huevos, al entrar en el juego en base a una ilegalidad. Para eso, los medios debían dar cancha a Podemos, tal como sucedió. Así si se puede entender la paradoja de que unos medios propiedad de la casta estuviesen aupando una nueva esperanza para dejar atrás a dicha casta (jajaja ... ilusos).

Teniendo esto en cuenta, **¿Que puede pasar cuando más tarde a Podemos les hagan supuestamente lo mismo, y la cúpula vaya a quejarse al maestro armero?** El maestro armero les diría: -chicos, si lo miramos todo y tiramos de la manta, saldrá la acojonante historia del pucherazo que os dio a vosotros la relevancia de la que os habéis aprovechado todo este tiempo, **¿podréis resistirlo?**-

Respuesta: las elecciones han sido perfectas, ejemplares, no hay pucherazo, todo ha sido limpio, la culpa es nuestra por la alianza con IU, el votante de Podemos se ha asustado del gobierno de Podemos (insulto a la inteligencia por parte del ""amado lider""), o por lo que se quiera escoger del repertorio que los ""analistas"" están dando estos días. **Troleo máximo** al más puro estilo R78.

Elaboration would be welcome.  Why is Le Pen applauding Brexit if the two movements are so different?  With the prospect of Nexit, Frexit, Grexit etc., and the Central EU states' similar xenophobia to the UK making them sympathetic to one of the arguments for Brexit, it seems there must be some tension in finding a common Brussels negotiating position satisfying all players and Germany.  I assume Germany needs to protect the Euro at all costs.

Let's just assume for a second that a vote means the result actually goes the way of the vote.

Meaning, a remain vote means we remain, and allows for leave to continue campaigning, as they have years to gain support and work towards another referendum.

A leave vote however, means we leave the EU. This doesn't allow remain to continue campaigning, because we will be leaving. 

You could campaign to rejoin once we've left, but to campaign to stay means leave does not get the same treatment as remain.

0,"Yes - in the EU, chargebacks are essentially only permitted in law by:

* in case of non-authorised use of the card
* goods and services not delivered or in breach of contract
* in the event of insolvency and the business cannot make a valid refund - in the UK this is only on credit cards under s.75 of the CCA.

Additionally, there are other voluntary provisions under the card scheme rules which banks sign up to.

In your case, the bank is claiming that the contract was validly executed by the gaming company - you paid to deposit a balance with the company in order to have the *capacity* to make future bets: you didn't pay for a bet directly with the cash.

Thus, at the time, the transaction was completely valid and there is no recourse to chargeback as the company fulfilled its contractual obligations - the balance was available to bet at the time, yes?

At the moment, what you want to do is withdraw money from your account - but as the company is in insolvency and your balance is deemed part of the company's assets, all you have now is an unsecured creditor's claim, rather than either a proprietary claim on your balance or recourse under s.75 of the CCA as you used a debit card.",False,False,t5_2wkka,UKPersonalFinance,,2,pflurklurk,0,1467375323,1471133918,2,,t1_d4v7zzr,t3_4qmmp4,,d4v8cvq

that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se
more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.*

0,"It is important to remember that for all the deliberate falsification of history for propaganda reasons by Russian government today it isn't as obvious and clear-cut as it was the case with Germany which was defeated, occupied by foreign powers and had its leaders tried for war crimes.

First of all the propaganda spanned *generations*. The Soviet regime which instigated the occupation in 1939 was one of the victors of the war and carried on to 1953 when Stalin died using the myth of the ""Great Patriotic War"" as a nation-building tool. It proved successful enough that it carried on throughout the entirety of the Cold War as an unifying strategy for a country that until 1941 had to use brutal force to stay together. After 50 years of this propaganda you have at least two generations who never knew anything else. This is similar to suggesting ""America brought 9/11 on itself"" in America. It goes against the national spirit in Russia and a government that advocates a critical approach will be considered to be treasonous by many who grew up learning the mythology. The pushback against any placement of the Soviet Union alongside Germany rather than its victim is going to be very strong and come from the people directly.  You have to remember that the USSR lost countless people in the war and the survivors and veterans have the mythology of being defenders of the ""good guys"" as the only true valuable thing in life. By painting the Soviet Union in its entirety as no different from Germany you are depraving these people and their children of their entire self-worth. There has been little else for them to have in a poor and oppressed society that Soviet Union allowed.


Secondly there are two important *practical* factors behind the mythology being so resilient aside from the propaganda:

---- 

One has to do with how the Soviet-German treaty was executed.  Despite having a secret clause Stalin did not immediately attack Poland and waited to when the war was decided and Germany moved already *behind* the agreed demarcation line. Thus the invasion of Poland was [concluded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland#/media/File:Poland2.jpg) even before any Soviet troops invaded because there were barely any forces left able to resist the Red Army. As a result of this the actual partition of Poland was [different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ribbentrop-Molotov.svg) from the agreed upon in the treaty and Germany took more territory. While Stalin excused his delay with the war against Japan I would think it was entirely deliberate. He *tricked* Germany into attacking Poland with the expectation of Soviets doing the same and then made Germany look as the only aggressor. Also you have to remember that Germany remembered that their relationship with the USSR was purely practical and that Stalin formally offered to intervene against Germany with the western powers on at least two occasions - in 1934 when Nazis took over and in 1938 before the Munich agreement. They wanted to guarantee Soviet neutrality by offering them some of strategically valuable territory. You should never consider the Ribbentropp-Molotov pact to be an expression of true friendship or even unity of purpose (destruction of Poland). *It was pure political expediency in the shortest of terms*.   As for Stalin's excuses the war against Japan was already won from the practical standpoint by the end of August 1939 with Japanese forces totally destroyed in the battles of [Khalkin-Gol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Khalkhin_Gol) and at the same time the USSR didn't begin to mobilize its European troops until 3rd or 5th of September! 

The other was the official pretense of entering Poland and also Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia ""in defense of Russian population in the territory"". There indeed *were* Russian, Belarussian and Ukrainian minorities in those countries and the portions of Poland inhabited by Belarussians and Ukrainians were acquired in a Polish-Soviet war after the collapse of Ukrainian and Belarussian independence movements after WW1. There were people, and not just insignificant minorities, who welcomed the Red Army as liberators from Poland the same way Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia welcomed Germany two years later. As if to further drive the point Polish military did not fight the Red Army in 1939 *by explicit order of the high command*. That order came as the result of the Polish-British alliance which was valid against Germany but would be [voided](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Polish_military_alliance#Analysis) immediately should Poland find itself in a state of war against the Soviet Union. Therefore Polish authorities sacrificed the futile and rather symbolic gesture of resistance (the war was already over with Germany disposing of the entirety of Polish army on their own) to preserve the alliance with Britain (however useless it turned out to be). Both Poles and Soviets knew however that it was a practical measure and USSR instituted mass repressions against Poles and murdered thousands of military officers in [Katyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre) as a deliberate measure to weaken any potential insurgency. Still the territory which Soviets invaded had only a *minority* of Poles (except Lithuania, which was a point of contention between Poland and the Republic of Lithuania created in 1918) and as history showed [later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia_and_Eastern_Galicia) the majority of Ukrainians didn't really consider the Poles to be legitimate authority as the Polish government claimed. While mass murder is always mass murder there must be causes already in place for such violent event to occur to begin with.

So it is natural that Russia has an overwhelmingly hostile  attitude towards any potential recrimination against Soviet Union in WW2 as an aggressor not only because of the long-lasting propaganda but also because of the actual  nature of how the aggression occurred. People want to be the ""good guys"" and will cling to all and any evidence to support it.

Think American Civil War and the issues of legality of secession and the slavery in the South. Could you imagine the opinion that it was an aggression from the North, secession was legal and that the war wasn't about slavery directly at all ever becoming popular enough in the mainstream that it would be openly discussed? You get bans for stating those opinions on reddit for example and they are perfectly reasonable ones. Far more than any suggestion that USSR was on the ""good"" side in WW2.

So just keep this in mind. There's more than blatant propaganda of Putin's regime at work here. Germany had a brief episode of Nazism and there were many people who accepted Hitler the same way you accept that your party lost the election but the government is the government and Nazi Germany did some truly outrageous things. Hitler had to ban and persecute both Communist and Social-Democratic parties in Germany which put together had the majority of votes in the previous elections. Russia - while they did many comparable atrocities - didn't also have a ""brief episode"". The ruthless regime in Russia was the *norm* since at least 1914 (excluding the 1905 revolution and the authoritarian nature of Tsarist regime in general) and the Soviets didn't invent new methods of oppression as much as just cranked up what already existed like [katorga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katorga) to the proverbial eleven. For most Russians it'd been always like that *and then it got worse*... Complaining that people were sent to camps or killed if they resisted is like complaining that it's cold in winter.

And finally as far as the Baltic states and Poland go denying the responsibility is an useful tool for inflaming the relations whenever Russia wants it as all those countries have a significant degree of ""Russo-phobic"" sentiment which plays right into the hands of Kremlin. Consider the diplomatic mess that ensued after the 2010 [crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Polish_Air_Force_Tu-154_crash) in Smolensk which killed the Polish president and numerous other important public figures. Why go out of your way to honour the past for a country which you like to present to your population as an ungrateful troublemaker at best?

However I don't think that any change in Polish-Russian and Baltic-Russian relationship is possible without admitting those facts. Which is to say it's unlikely to ever happen...",1467377636,False,t5_2qh4j,europe,,7,kmar81,1,1467375667,1471133992,7,,t3_4qr66h,t3_4qr66h,,d4v8if3

Needless to say, it was at the pick of the bubble so there were plenty of jobs waiting for me, however, I only managed to work through agencies (4 different jobs in 18 months vs 2 jobs in England in 4 years) and after 18 months a company offered me to stay permanent.

0,"Yeah, following subsequent research, I definitely was off about some stuff in there, and it turns out that a lot of the Tiger sightings that I found there ended up being King Tigers, and going back to the Zaloga interview he did say that the Americans ran into King Tigers way more often than Tiger Is on the *Western Front*. 

Zaloga also describes one of his ""three times"" as ""And then there was a single Tiger company up in the Bulge that was involved in some fighting."" which could lead to multiple encounters. He even said ""It definitely could have happened, there are certainly lots of gaps in the historical record both on the German side and the US side. I think the idea that the US encountered a lot of Tigers during WW2 is simply due to the tendency of the US troops to call all German tanks Tigers."" 

I have to defend Zaloga, because I think he has said nothing wrong. He's basically saying ""Tiger I encounters with American troops were actually very rare, I've only been able to find 3 separate instances where they were definitely in the same area of operations and reports are 100% confirmable. There were probably a few more, but not many"" That's an accurate, nuanced way of looking at it. 

Moran parroted this, but in a way to sound entertaining and interesting to people who aren't necessarily interested in the nitty gritty of doing history. He said, ""In *northwest Europe* between D-Day and the Fall of Germany, American *tankers* saw Tiger Is only 3 times."" Moran has taken Zalogas open-ended, trend-focused statement, and turned it into a more absolute statement. I don't like absolute statements in History, but at least he still qualified *tankers,* *Tiger Is* and *northwest Europe.*

Unfortunately, Moran was talking to a bunch of WT and WoT players, who have no idea what nuance is, so that whole thing quickly becomes ""*US soldiers of all types only saw Tiger Is or Tiger IIs three times ever through the entire war*"" like Italy and North Africa don't exist.

Il faut bien que la France soit ""plus compétitive"" au sens des dirigeants européistes non-élus pour qu'elle puisse continuer à ""sauver"" la zone euro, de la même manière qu'on garde en vie un comateux. 

Si la France se retrouvait en difficulté, ça serait à l'Allemagne de voler à son secours, comme elle a dû le faire pour l'Irlande, la Grèce, le Portugal, l'Espagne, un peu l'Italie. Sauf qu'elle ne peut pas sauver des gros pays comme l'Italie ou la France, cela signifierait donc la fin de la zone euro.

Ca n'est que donc cohérent, même indispensable au maintien.

If that's what you define as a ""sinking ship"", then you are definitely going to beat us to the bottom of the ocean.

Except that the first is irrelevant, the second is debatable, the third is already not quite true and will definitely not be true once the finance sector flees London. The UK's place in NATO and the UNSC is another irrelevance, and as for Nuclear power in case you haven't noticed Scotland considers that one a negative and has been wanting to stop spending money on Trident for decades.

Oh, and London is an alpha +++ city right now. It certainly won't be in a year or two unless the Brexit gets cancelled.

A ship being big and shiny doesn't stop it from sinking. The titanic looked great up until it sunk.

&gt;In exchange for cutting off the dead weight of those English bastards, you'll be moving your highest lawmaking body from the infamous 'Westminster', to Brussels, where you will have even less representation, and even less appeal. 

&gt;You'll be gaining independence from the Devils in Westminster (where we've had Scottish prime ministers, and Scotland's problems need to be addressed as they make up a 10% of the British population, not saying Scotland is brilliantly represented in Westminster, but to suggest they're totally ignored is a farce), and handing it straight over to Brussels, where they do not care about your people, your culture your personal international interests, nothing. 

Any problem that Scotland and England disagrees on, is ruled in favour of England. That's is the core problem here and it's one you completely fail to grasp.

So we'll have less representation in the EU? So what? That's already the case for us. The difference really isn't that great.

More importantly, the advantage of the EU is that there's many more parties involved. Which means while some voices dominate, unlike the UK there isn't a single voice dominating all others. 

&gt;In terms of short term economics, which is where the ""sinking ship"" rhetoric is seeming to come from, I'm not sure there is an argument for who will be worse off. If Scotland decides to go for ""independence"" AND join Europe, under the Maastricht treaty you will have to join the Euro.

No, the loss of London's finance sector over the next few years is where it comes from. 1 in every 5 tax pounds in the UK comes from London, and it's about to be gutted.

Which in turn is why all the stuff about the deficit is irrelevant as well. We're already looking at austerity and cuts. There's simply no avoiding it. So why hang around waiting for the next bright idea that England will force onto the rest of us?

&gt;I will always believe in the union between our two great nations. The SNP to me are no different to UKIP, they preach divisiveness and vitriol and pounce on any vulnerability and exploit it.

Then you're ignorant. I'm sorry but it's really that simple. If you honestly think of the relationship between the UK and Scotland this way then you don't understand Scotland's side of this. The SNP may look that way to you, but that really just means you haven't studied the two parties, because as much as I disliked the SNP up until all of this, I'd never have seriously compared them to UKIP.

&gt;I hope that we can find a way to progress towards greatness together, rather than fade away into darkness and obscurity. I'm sorry if that upsets you.

Cut the shit. What you hope is that Scotland hangs around and absorbs some of the pain that England and Wales just voted for. Getting angry at someone for refusing to be your meat shield is ridiculous.

There's no progressing towards greatness on the path Leave has hurled us onto. There's a nasty drop into darkness and you're advocating for dragging the country you claim that you'd fight for off that ledge along with your own. That's not allegiance, it's servitude.

0,"Reminds me of this patriotic flyover in England. 

&gt; As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I'm most often asked is ""How fast would that SR-71 fly?"" I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual “high” speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn’t previously seen.

&gt; So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, “what was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?” This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following.

&gt; I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England , with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield.

&gt; Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing.

&gt; Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field—yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast.

&gt; Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it.. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower.

&gt; Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes.

&gt; After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet’s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of “breathtaking” very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach.

&gt; As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn't spoken a word since “the pass.” Finally, Walter looked at me and said, “One hundred fifty-six knots.
What did you see?” Trying to find my voice, I stammered, “One hundred fifty-two.” We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, “Don’t ever do that to me again!” And I never did.

&gt; A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer’s club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, “It was probably just a routine low approach; they're pretty impressive in that plane.” Impressive indeed.

&gt;Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. It’s ironic that people are interested in how slow the world’s fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed, however, it’s always a good idea to keep that cross-check up…and keep your Mach up, too.

He had made it to the round alongside Freedom Party candidate Norbert Hofer, who campaigned to protect Austria from mass migration and Islamification.

&gt; Given that the election was carried by just 30,863 votes, and up to 740,000 postal votes are in question the Constitutional court has now ruled the vote should be re-run, although the date for this has not yet been announced.

&gt; Hofer, who initially told press his party would not be contesting the elections despite the close vote before the serious voting problems became apparent, campaigned on his Euroscepticism and opposition to mass migration to Austria.

Pretty sure if he got 100% of privileged people that would be nearly just 100% of people. Almost everyone is privileged in some way. There aren't a lot of disabled gay black autistic Muslim poor trans women out there. Part of being a good person, imo, is recognizing your privilege and not getting defensive about it. Recognizing for example that as a white person you have certain advantages that black people don't have. What you *should* do is keep that in mind and be aware that when you speak about race you are speaking from a position of privilege, and when people try to end white privilege, that is not an attack on you personally, it's an attack on the way society is set up. However I foresee a lot of people responding to the social progress that we have made by trying to lash out against progressive movements.

&gt; White people were pissed off that black people defeated segregation in the South and attained the right to vote in 1965, but we still were a liberal country, and liberal people (yes, Nixon was a liberal by both our standards and the standards in 1968) continued to be elected. White, conservative people are always pissed about something--it's what they do--and it never really changes anything substantially. Even the reactionary candidates Goldwater and Wallace were defeated by more moderate, reasonable candidates despite Vietnam and integration.

This is actually a very, very good point. I still think this year might be the exception but I am a very pessimistic person so you very well may be right.

&gt; 
Then what was the Tea Party movement? I think the right-wing movement has come and gone. What we're seeing now is more of a reactionary ""thing"" by a very vocal minority of Americans on the right. I think people are fed up with the whining and bitching of folks on the right on totally ridiculous causes, especially our generation. Who, in our generation, truly gives a shit about who can marry who? Who gives a shit about who can use what restroom?

I mean, I'm seeing a lot of right-wing stuff. For example the whole Trump movement, I think he's more of a reactionary candidate than Bush Jr or McCain or Romney was. Brexit happened too, right-wing groups are winning elections in Europe... It seems like it's still growing in strength. And you're right that our generation doesn't really support a lot of the silly right-wing shit (banning gay marriage, bathroom bans) but not only our generation can vote.

&gt; The data does not substantiate this claim. Women are elected to office all the time, and Hillary leads in every poll.

Les projets gouvernementaux sont plutôt en hausse que ce soit en Afrique, en Amérique du Nord, dans le reste de l'Europe ou même en Asie. Mais ces projets se font principalement (proportionnellement) depuis la France ou vers la France (par exemple http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20160701-cameroun-france-contrat-developpement-c2d)... en observant les activités des pays membres de l'OIF on se rend compte que c'est encore assez centralisé en ce qui concerne la promotion de l'usage la langue française, dans ce domaine la France et le Québec sont en pointe. Il reste encore à voir de réelles prises en charges massives et gouvernementales de la diffusion du français entre d'autres membres de la Francophonie. 

La France en particulier est aussi prise dans un étau post-colonialiste, surtout vis à vis des NU, qui l'empêche d'adopter des positions trop ""familières"" avec des pays qui sont sortis du ventre des colonies françaises et belges au siècle dernier.

Bien sûr les grandes entreprises francophones participent aussi à cette diffusion linguistique et géopolitique, mais là encore proportionnellement aux PIB des états de la francophonie, les choses sont encore très centrées vers l'Europe de l'ouest et l'Est du Canada. Donc je dirais que les moyens gouvernementaux et la volonté sont là (85M €/an pour l'OIF, ça peut paraître petit à première vue mais à cela s'ajoutent les budgets des grands réseaux médiatiques avec le fameux congloméra géant ""France Médias Monde"" au CA de 250M€/an, plus l'AUF (Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie) au budget de 37M€ et toutes les actions et plans gouvernementaux nationaux et organisations locales francophones dont on ne sait pas évaluer précisément l'impact financier et humain...) mais que les choses doivent s'équilibrer et que l'on doit se soucier, après une certaine indépendance politique des états du sud, de les aider aussi à acquérir une indépendance culturelle dans la francophonie. Ca veut dire encourager les programmes d'éducations, d'échanges, d'aide à l'entreprenariat, de micro crédit etc. Et cela, si l'OIF est la seule à le faire, ça va mettre beaucoup plus de temps qu'il n'en faudrait si des volontés politiques et des moyens entre de nombreux états étaient mises en commun sur la durée.",1467380860,False,t5_2qhjz,france,Francophonie,3,wisi_eu,0,1467379010,1471134764,3,ZAFrancophonie,t1_d4v98vf,t3_4qqwfb,,d4va5jy

Also, my friends living in The Netherlands and their Dutch friends agree with your sentiment regarding the difference in the languages, they just didn't put it so quite so nicely.

Regarding the cultural similarities, aside from the love of farming, I think the Afrikaners have distanced themselves from The Netherlands/Belgium/France way way more than English South Africans have and I wanted to bounce that off an actual Dutchman.  I also asked because the more conservative members of my wife's family know who Geert Wilders is and they're big fans.  That surprised me because until then, I thought Afrikaners the most myopic culture in a country that almost celebrates it, so either the conservative youth are looking more to Europe for their political views or virtually every Afrikaner I've spoken with has done a brilliant job of playing dumb when it comes to international relations.

Getting facts is difficult and takes hours of wading through statistics and still one can not always be certain. Not being able to trust politicians statements is a big thing IMO.

We need a system where politicians make a statement of the facts they're relying on - eg the £350 million figure: Johnson could say I represent that based on sources X, Y and Z this figure is true under penalty of perjury. That statement then could be challenged in court and if found clearly false he would be evicted from Parliament and fined a sum equal to his last 5 years of income (or something else appropriate).

I wasn't doubting your figure of £8 billion, I had that number in mind too.

By ""red herring"" I meant people like Farage and certain papers played up its importance - because there is no doubt that the trade agreements could completely dwarf an £8 billion shortfall. I can't be arsed googling it (we've all googled so much of this stuff recently!) but in 2015 the UK imported about £300 billion a year from the EU in goods and services, with a trade deficit of about £70 billion.

Merkel and others have been very clear in the last few days that there will be no entry to the single market without free movement, which was an enormous (maybe the biggest) part of the exit campaign.

You're right, it's possible. But it would mean completely reneging on the very platform on which Brexit was sold, which is obviously very unappealing for the Tories.

As a Host, we require guests to have fully verified ID's with the green badge, especially if there are no prior reviews.  Most guests will get it if prompted by me.  There also needs to be a decent Profile pic of you for ID when you arrive at the listing.

From my experience, you can get the Verified ID a number of different ways, you might try something else.  I think most people use their DL.  BTW, in Europe, most hotels will want to take your passport and give it back to you later, I think it is the law in some places.  Having Airbnb keep your ID data securely and privately without having the Hosts see it is much more secure.  In my mind, you are already giving Airbnb your CC# which seems like a more important piece of private data than your SSN.

We save up all our pocket money and buy a giant scissors. Like one at least 2 km long.

We take our scissors on the ferry over to Scotland as a gift for Nicola Sturgeon.

Nicola, on the sly, starts severing the English/Scottish border with the scissors.

If the English notice and start kicking up a fuss we send in some craic squads of Irish football fans to distract them with cans and a sing-song.

We attach the now free-floating Scotland to Paul O’Connell, who has been patiently waiting off the west coast of Scotland.

Paul tows Scotland to the top of our island and we swap it with the North (remember: we still have the scissors).

We glue Scotland to the top of Ireland while Paul tows the North up past Buncrana towards Sligo, where we use more glue to attach it there.

We *maybe* repeat the whole process with Wales, still on the fence about this one, might have to take a vote.

0,"It's really difficult to explain, because UEFA haven't released the figures regarding how much they sold the rights for last season (or they didn't last time I checked). But I'll try to explain. 

For 15/16, the overall prize pot for the market pool was around £400m. That's divided between the countries represented in the draw depending on how much they sell TV rights for. 

Say for example the rights to show the CL across Europe pockets UEFA €2bn, and the rights in England were sold to BT for €500m (a quarter of the total) the English clubs would get 25% of the market pool. This doesn't depend on how many teams qualify, so say if United lost to Gent in the qualifiers last year, it'd have been 25% shared 3 ways not 4. 

In 14-15, English clubs got 19% of the market pool, but that's to change because the 3-yearly sale of TV rights took effect for the 15-16 season and as explained, last I checked, the figures relating to it hasn't been released. However we can estimate.

Sky and ITV previously paid £400m for the CL rights to be aired in the UK, BT paid £900m for this season and the two to come. 

If that £400m previously represented 19% of the rights sold, you can work out that the collective rights sold pocketed UEFA £2.1bn. For estimations sake, let's assume every other countries TV deal increased by 25%, that makes the total a round £3bn, to which England contributed £900m, or 30%.

As the market pool is £400m, the English clubs would therefore share £120m(30%). The market pool is split into two equal pots, so in the case for the English clubs, two pots of £60m. 

One pot is based on where you finished in the previous domestic season. 40% goes to the champions, 30% to the runners up, 20% to third and 10% to fourth. City would therefore get 30% of £60m, which is £18m, and United would get 10%, only £6m. 

The other half of the Market Pool is split on the basis of the number of games played by each English club as a proportion of the total played by all those clubs in the group stage and beyond. To illustrate how this works, United got knocked out in the group stage and therefore only played six qualifying games. We played 12 games, and Chelsea/Arsenal played 8 each. That makes 34 games altogether. That means we get 12/34ths of that second pot of £60m or just over £21m. 


Adding the two pots together gives £39m, plus the £30m or so from the stage payments. United would only get around £30m in total if you work it out.

This is all based on estimation, I can't work out how much of the TV rights BT makes up, but it could quite easily be more than 30% which would make us even more and create further disparity betwene us and United. 30% is about bare minimum given the nature of the sum that BT paid. You can adjust the figures accordingly if it makes up 40% or 50%, whatever it may be.

Il est venu à mon bureau et m'a demandé si j'aimais lire.

Encore une fois, j'ai dit oui, pourquoi pas. Même si je n'étais pas particulièrement à l'aise d'aborder le thème de la religion en milieu de travail.

Alors il est retourné à son bureau et m'a ramené un Coran. Un beau livre avec une couverture solide, pas une version bon marché.

Est-ce que le Coran a été écrit par Mohammed ? Non, Mohammed était analphabète. Mais il avait une excellente mémoire et à transmis son savoir à des érudits.

N'y a-t-il pas plusieurs version de ce qu'il faut faire dans un cas précis selon certains textes, et que seul un expert (scholar) peut se prononcer sur quelle est la version qui a préséance sur une autre ? Oui, mais ça c'est les hadith, pas le Coran.

And what we have here was 1000x more complex - the problem with the EU ref was quite something else. It's that people weren't actually voting as a reflection of their will or interest, but on what they *perceived* the vote to be about.

Essentially a lot of people thought it was about immigration when it wasn't at all. And other things between, too.

Now see the obvious problem here?

Democracy is not just a system where you tally up what a bunch of peoples ticks on cards and then do what it says. I mean ideally it would work that way, because ideally the things people tick would be educated and informed and actually reflect their will.

However in this case it's abundantly clear that the majority don't even *want* this - we *know* that to be the case, we know that the things that will happen if we leave are not even the will of the majority.

And this causes a problem - which choice is really democratic when you actually know this? Following the official tally act acting against the true will of the people? Or ignoring a national referendum and acting in the majority and best interest of the people?

The problem isn't a referendum or where you set the winning margin, but actually ensuring the result matches the will of the people who vote in it. If everyone is not properly informed then the referendum result is not democratic anyway... which is really just the argument ""we shouldn't have put it to a referendum"" cos we clearly aren't in a system where we can get a result that is a true reflection of will.",False,False,t5_2qhqb,unitedkingdom,Bradford,11,Snoron,0,1467382130,1471135651,11,cnty-england,t1_d4vbn4h,t3_4qqzyb,,d4vc1a8

Insane as it fucking is, it was amazingly effective. Are you familiar with the Ottoman empire back in the 16th century?

They had an elite standing force known as the Janissaries. Kinda like Cossack participation in the world wars, and how they served the Germans. Except, a little bit more insane on the Turk's side. Janissaries were originally Christian men that served the interests of the West, either as soldiers, farmers, inhabitants or whatnot. Janissary ranks were also filled with Christian-born children from time to time.

Because there was a fear of Janissaries going about Ottoman villages and raping the women of pure Turkmen families, they had each Janissary castrated when they were young so as to avoid any rape incidents. This also kept the Janissaries humilated and loyal to their Sultan and commanders. In addition to the indoctrination they suffered.

The Turks were a major proponent of the Arabic slave trade after they took Konstantiniyye and made it Istanbul.

Much of professional accounting work involves estimates, analysis, and professional judgment.  It's why F/S aren't done on the cash method.  

Much of those estimates and analyses are much more complex than it used to be due to globalization and technology.  So a mid-sized manufacturing company in Ohio can have sales offices in Europe, plants in Latin America, and financing from Asian firms.

They may seek to acquire software firms that supplies its business and then spin off or sell parts of those business unrelated to its business.  It may have to convert IFRS F/S to GAAP ones.

0,"My view is this:

When you have a move in a stock like ABX that is up 189% YTD (or AG up 315%), I'm not interested in buying from the standpoint of I feel like buying is chasing a move and being very much late to the party.  This is heightened when it comes to something like miners, which are basically more or less a leveraged play on metals and if it turned the other way, that could result in real problems. Miners have absolutely been the place to be this year, but look at most of them over the past few - when gold wasn't doing well, miners were doing abysmally badly. My other issue with miners is the idea that all manner of things can come out of left field and cause problems with miners during otherwise fine times for gold; this is especially true when you are dealing with smaller companies.

So, to summarize: 

1. I personally look at a stock up nearly 200% or 300+% in a manner of 7 months as having missed the move and I don't want to chase that. I may wind up being wrong, but I'm okay with that.

2. If the Brexit situation gets worse and/or you have problems in Europe, then you may have another push higher in gold and another push higher in miners.

3. The market is already nearly back to where it was pre-Brexit. If volatility and distress over the implications of the situation cool further, you could get a pullback in gold and a material pullback in miners that have already soared this year.

Personally, I have no desire to chase miners and really am looking for things that I can feel more comfortable about for the long-term rather than miners that can absolutely soar one year and be in the toilet in the next. If you are buying miners here, you have to believe that there is going to be further political and economic distress in the near-term. That very well may be the case, but I'm not willing to make that bet. Good luck to you if you do.

My band has gotten some great support on this fantastic subreddit so I wanted to post our latest release!  It's a split 7"" with some friends from Virginia called DIE FASTER.  

As with most of our releases, we wanted to come up with some cool artwork to pair with the vinyl.  We ordered a ream of paper, hand cut and folded it into an origami pocket, and then block printed 3 different images onto the fronts of the pocket to create the artwork.

As for the record itself, each side has 3 songs and all 500 copies are on orange vinyl.  

You can check the imgur link ( http://imgur.com/a/vknfp ) for a few close up shots of the release and I've posted a time lapse (with a song from our side!) if you'd like to see the process we went through to create every single copy of this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbWy8Kz4kFw&amp;feature=youtu.be

0,"&gt; European unity is a good thing (agreed upon rules and regulations between countries that in some cases supersedes local sovereignty), but add a few more countries to the mix and it becomes a ploy by corporations to exploit the poor working class (this sounds familiar)

To be fair this phenomenon has been discussed as of late, with the decline of the political (centre) left support for free trade has fallen. 

Basically this is because the whole internationalist drive separates society into two groups, the poor/middle class who are put in a society where its free for all (declining social security, increasing taxes, open labour markets, massive global immigration of the worlds poor etc.) where as the top is safely protected to keep their wealth. Large corporations are protected by diverging regulation, foreign large corporations are held at bay, and if large corporations go bankrupt they'll be saved with tax payers money.

The political left always pretended that the people thrown in the fighting pit (the labourers) will be compensated, but instead the people in the top were (bail-outs and all that). 

This is what has made people turn so anti-globalist, a double measure, use protectionism and borders to protect the wealth of the few, but open all flood gates to the poor/middle class/the many (where having borders and protection are racist and fascist, and unprogressive/outdated)

Don't get me wrong, I'm for free trade, I'm also convinced TTIP could be a good thing , but I'm for equality first and foremost, meaning we must open the flood gates and lower our guard for the top just as we did for the rest. 

Ironically TTIP actually is actually that to some extent, even though people blame it to be the opposit.

0,"&gt; Ok, well if you clump all immigration together then yea it is positive

I wasn't clumping all immigration together. I was specifically talking ONLY about EU immigration.

Immigrants from outside the EU don't tend to be as qualified and so tend to be a net drain on public finances (they pay less tax and use more services) - but this debate has nothing to do with immigrants from outside the EU such as Syrian refugees.

EU immigrants pay more in than they take out in services - so these people actually help prop up services like the NHS and schools, etc. - to the tune of about £20bn per year!

https://next.ft.com/content/c49043a8-6447-11e4-b219-00144feabdc0

Also, EU immigration has not harmed the pay, jobs or public services enjoyed by Britons. In fact, for the most part it has likely made us better off.

http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/reality-check-are-eu-migrants-really-taking-british-jobs

&gt; The UK can choose who to admit, as part of the EU they cannot.

This is just a false claim. We already limit migration from outside the EU and we can tighten or loosen this as much as we want.

&gt; In the EU Britain gets less say over what the laws are, they are one of 27 where if they were independent they would have 100% control over their laws.

This is a misleading claim because most of these laws are trade laws which we would have to abide by in order to trade with Europe anyway. This is something we certainly want to keep doing and is not something that is going to change once we leave.

There are some other laws though which countries decide together for our common benefit. Like emissions targets. If each European country was free to set its own emissions targets there would simply be a race to the bottom - this is why we agree on targets together as a block. It means nobody is put at a disadvantage when we all agree to aim for the same target.

The rest of the EU laws which we abide by are a lot like this.

It is also worth pointing out that we agree with the other members of the European Parliament a lot! We've been in favour of about 75% of the motions that have gone through parliament this last year.

&gt; The EU is a bit socialist and since the UK is a richer country they give more than they get in benefits to support the poorer countries.

I don't know why you think this is a negative thing. The economic case for us remaining in the EU is enormous compared to the cost of membership. By some estimates our GDP is 10% higher than it would be if we were out - this translates into hundreds of billions of pounds for the treasury.

We will also still be paying this membership fee once we leave if we hope to remain part of the trading block. Even Nigel Farage has admitted as such.

But it's also a good thing that the EU takes a little of our membership fee and uses it help lift poorer European countries out of poverty. Many of their economies have been shattered after the effects of communism. The quicker we can help their economies grow, the more we will be able to trade with them and the richer we will all get. Supporting poorer countries is a no-brainer and is a clear investment in the future of the trading bloc.

&gt; Norway and Switzerland have refused EU membership and would gladly be accepted if they wanted to, they must have valid reasons as well.

They have nationalists holding them back much like the rest of us.

&gt; EU Army?

Would have to be agreed by every single country including the EU. It's also redundant given the role played by the UN.

http://www.cer.org.uk/insights/eu-army-four-reasons-it-will-not-happen

&gt; Why not include other continents in the union?

There are strict rules about standards and requirements for joining. Allowing a country that was too poor and lacking certain essential freedoms would destabilise the Union

&gt; What is best for one country is not necessarily best for all, by leaving the UK can make all of it's laws based on the foundation what is best for the UK, not what is best for all of Europe because they are not necessarily the same thing.

I deal with this argument here: appropriate laws should be decided at appropriate levels.

&gt; No argument made, so nothing to debate.

I'll just point out what economists currently forecast:

0,"As someone who possibly upvotes and/or makes those comments, allow me to explain.

First off, part of this behaviour is a backlash. I'm European, and a lot of the people I see making these comments are European as well. /r/Europe has also been mentioned as a hotbed of ""racism"" in this thread, and we see the same behaviour there. For several decades, the ruling narrative has been that you can't say anything bad about Islam. This is not a hyperbole. In Europe, we've seen a lot of pro-Islamic politics. And you can't argue against anti-Islamic sentiment without examining the relationship between Islam and left wing politics in Europe.

Second, this is not an issue of racism. Here comes the old chestnut: Religion is not race. And no matter how much that phrase bothers you (or maybe it doesn't, but it certainly bothers a lot of people), or how many people claim the opposite, you are not born as a Muslim. You are born into Muslim culture, and then as an adult decide to carry on its cultural values for whatever reasons. This is the crux: We are experiencing a massive culture clash in Europe, the peak of which being France, with a 10% Islamic population. It's not a racist claim to say that the presence of Muslims in European cultures is leading to a lot of trouble.

They didn't just spring up out of thin air, either. They were brought over as part of a political policy as practiced by our politicians. Many of us don't feel this is a wise policy, we don't see the advantage to our countries, and we want to exercise our democratic right to stop it. This shouldn't be such a big issue, yet it is. The ""far right"" has been seeking representation since the 80's, but it took 20 years for it to happen. All that time the sentiment hasn't disappeared, and it certainly wasn't caused by its leaders somehow manipulating the masses. See, this sort of condescending view towards the people who are sceptical of the benefits of Islamic immigration doesn't do much for public relations. While we're constantly cautioned against judging Muslims as a group to the point where Muslims automatically stop being Muslims the moment they pull the trigger (look at you, /r/news), the Western right is afforded none of that nuance. So why should you expect them to treat others that way? And really, how many times can you call someone a fascist before the insult loses its power? We're finding out right now, in Europe.

At present it's undeniable that the Islamic community in Europe is a sort of shadow-society. A group of people who adhere to a different culture than the nation around them, and I get the impression a lot of Muslims want to have their cake, and eat it, too. That is to say, they want to be exempt from criticism on their group as a whole, but also make use of the advantages that being a seperate group affords. So Muslims become Schrödinger's minority: A group when they are insulted, but individuals when they in turn harm others.

If you are curious about seeing things my way, imagine you receive a lot of immigrants from a group you already dislike. Say, Trump voters. Suddenly they just pile into your country, make no secret of their contempt for your goatfucking ways, start making lewd remarks to women in hijab, keep living like they're still in the South of the US draining the oil out of their trucks on the public street, the whole nine yards. And instead of trying to integrate them, the government goes after anyone even pointing out their behaviour, favours them with special privileges, etc. How often do you need to hear about your sister being harrassed by Trumpists, or your mother being sued by them for doing her job, before you decide it's a structural problem? Certainly, you wouldn't want to live in Trump's America.

Well, I don't want to live in Muhammed's Europe.

I have no problem with the individual Muslim, in theory. I do have a problem with Islamic immigration. I don't have a problem with Islam as a personal belief system. I do have a problem with Islam as a political entity that demands special rights for its members.

I have no real hatred in me for the individual Muslim. Just a pragmatism that allows me to see that traditional Islamic values are severely at odds with the Western society I love and value. And if you now say ""well, I respect your values, your rights, and I don't give two fucks if you insult the prophet or wipe your ass with the Quran, because my faith is my own conviction that needs no outside validation in the form of oppressive law"" then I can also say that those insults are not being levelled at you, because it gets tedious to say add ""(except you dudes who are chill)"" with every point you make. If you do love Western society, whether you like it or not, *you are on our side*.

I mean even if you put aside the economic instability as an uncertainty (which I personally wouldn't do since we are already witnessing some), there are tons of claims that they couldn't back up. They misrepresented EU dues, misleadingly claimed it would go to NHS, misled voters about what the exit negotiations would look like (e.g. border control may not happen if they want to keep trading with the EU), and didn't give a good representation of just how complex renegotiating all the treaties, laws, and regulations was going to be. 

So, that goes back to OP's point about ""well-informed"" voters. It is hard to have a well-informed populace when one side is promising things it probably can't deliver. I mean, how are the Leavers going to give people what they demand here? There is a 2-year clock once article 50 is invoked and the EU is not going to bend over.

It's all over the news. note, I'm making a point that these people were mostly born here, have thick English accents and 'go home' means go back to London, where they are from :/ It scares me, because one thing I always thought we had right here was race relations, at least in the places I've lived where mosques are across the road from pubs, everyone talks in the street and racism is a rare incident of a lone nutjob rather than a constant feed on facebook. Attacks randomly happen here, and I haven't heard much about an increase in violence bar a few petrol bombs thrown into shops (which also occasionally happens), but verbal abuse certainly *appears* to be on the rise. And they are not stopping at non-whites; anyone with white skin and a non UK accent is also being targeted.

I think racists here are fucking idiots and wish I could pack them into a missile and fire them into space, but sadly it's not possible. Our media and government is equally as guilty for stirring things up, lying and causing this whole fucking mess to begin with seeing as the Brexit thing was just politicians vying for power and subsequently running away when the shit hit the fan.

It most definately is, in the UK our biggest supermarket chains boycott Israeli goods, people will only see reports of kids getting slaughtered on the news before they get pissed off with the perpetrators.

&gt;I don't know what you are talking about, other than that one MP who lost her shadow position because of a tweet saying Israel's Jews should all be forced out of the Middle East.

That is the exact incident I'm talking about. Years before she was an MP she said Israel should be relocated to the USA. A naive comment to make, but that's not the point. She was suspended years later because of that tweet after she became MP, even though she apologized. THEN a major party member defended her saying it was a long time ago and she shouldn't be forced to resign, then he was forced to resign as well lol.

I also watched a documentary where an old Israeli female minister was interviewed and when asked how do you deal with comments criticizing Israel, she said, oh we just call them anti Semitic and they can't say anything.

On another note, relocating Israel to America isn't a half bad idea, they have a lot of space and the bigger population of jews than anywhere else in the world. Besides, Zionism is a political ideology, its not religious, I'd rather live somewhere in midwest USA than the desert in Israel.

Doesn't your scripture say you have to wait for your messiah to turn up before you can get a homeland anyway? So Zionists are already picking and choosing what rules they want to listen to, why stop there, just move the homeland somewhere less contested and you won't have such a huge PR problem with the west, the east, and everyone who prefers not seeing innocent Palestinians confined to Ghettos and frequently terrorised...

It just doesn't work like that I'm afraid. The UK had so many exemptions in place already, you got even **more** in February, but that was sold to the people as being nothing at all.

If you want to be part of the actual Single Market you should know what the definition of it is in the first place:

&gt;A single market (sometimes called 'internal market') allows for people, goods, services and capital to move around a union as freely as they do within a single country – instead of being obstructed by national borders and barriers as they were in the past. Citizens can study, live, shop, work and retire in any member state.

0,"&gt;Dear TotallySpursy,
 
&gt;Thank you for your email regarding the European Union (EU) referendum.
 
&gt;As I am sure you will appreciate, following recent events I have been contacted by a large number of constituents on both sides. Below I have tried to address all the concerns and questions that I have received to ensure that you have a full and informative response. However, I would like to take this time to thank you for writing to me with your personal views and comments, all of which I have read.
 
&gt;As you will now know, I voted and campaigned to leave the EU. I, along with all constituents, had a single vote in the referendum and I voted for what I believe is in the interest of the country.
 
&gt;I note that many people have said that my view is not representative of the majority of people who voted in my constituency, however, it was up to each individual to decide how they wished to vote, including Members of Parliament. You will be aware that for the referendum, the Prime Minister lifted collective responsibility and so all MPs, including Ministers, voted and campaigned based on their own personal views in the same way as members of the public. I hope that you had the chance to place your vote.
 
&gt;As with all votes, it would have been impossible for a Member of Parliament to vote only in the way in which their constituents requested them to – members of the public have a variety of views and opinions and it would be impossible to take them all into account when voting. Indeed, over 32,000 of my constituents agree with my vote, and neighbouring towns such as Watford (part of which is in my constituency but not included in these figures) voted to leave. Looking at the figures, I also note that my vote was in tune with Hertfordshire as a whole.
 
&gt;When an individual voted, they were not voting for or against any party or MP, but instead a cross-party campaign. Indeed, my vote was not a mandate from myself to St Albans. I was elected on a pro-referendum, Eurosceptic platform as recently as a year ago, and have always been happy to share my views on this topic.
 
&gt;Whilst I understand you are disappointed in my vote, this was a rightly made by the public and not just MPs. I have been pleased to discuss this very important matter with many of my constituents who have fully engaged both sides of the debate. I campaigned on the market stall in St Albans and have been approached by many constituents in a variety of ways who wished to discuss and express their opinion. For many weekends prior to the referendum, there was also a Remain stall, and I was pleased that the information available to local residents was balanced and clear.
 
&gt;I strongly believe in democracy, and when making decisions as fundamentally important as the constitution the country must come first. If all MPs who voted differently to the majority of their constituents were to step down from their position, a large proportion would have to resign including some of those who voted to remain. Indeed, only 24% of MPs backed leaving the EU. This referendum had a high turnout and I believe that democracy has spoken. As such, I cannot support another referendum, as I know many people have suggested. This is a view I would have held regardless of the result, and it is now the job of the government to deliver the will of the people.
 
&gt;I do not accept that too little information was made available to the public prior to their vote. I was involved in the hustings in St Albans which discussed both sides of the referendum arguments, pieces in the Herts Advertiser and, as I mentioned, market stalls. This topic was featured at length for many weeks in the national media and there were TV debates featuring many different individuals from both sides of the debate. A number of leaflets were also put out also, including those funded by both campaigns and the taxpayer.
 
&gt;Some people have asked for my views on the Conservative Party leadership and, as you will know, the Prime Minister has decided to resign his position. I do believe he recognised that, given his defence of the European Union, it would not be good for the stability of the country for him to be the one to negotiate our exit deal. We do not know at this point who will be in the leadership contest, however, I believe that we need a pragmatic approach going forward. It is the MPs’ job to whittle down the candidates to two people, after which it will be given to the Conservative Party members to vote on. I am confident that plenty of interviews and airtime will be given to the candidates so that members can make an informed decision.
 
&gt;I understand concerns regarding the recent market turbulence - this was anticipated following a vote to leave and I am confident it will settle down in the coming weeks. Exiting the EU is a complicated process and will, of course, take time as new laws and regulations are put in place and we take back control of our democracy. It will not be a quick process, however I believe it will be a slow and gradual disentanglement process.
 
&gt;For those who have asked questions about specific policy areas, I would reassure you that there will be no immediate changes and the UK will be a member of the EU for at least a further two years. As more information becomes available, please do contact me with questions or your views about any policy decisions.
 
&gt;Finally, I am of course aware of national reports of increased racist behaviour. I do not think anyone would endorse this xenophobic, disgraceful attitude and I do not accept that there is any excuse for it. I fully condemn this in the strongest possible way – no matter which side of the debate you’re on, we need to treat each other with civility and respect.  I have been in contact with the local Police and Crime Commissioner to discuss these national reports and would urge anyone who witnesses such behaviour to report it.
 
&gt;I understand that some have been disappointed with my view, however I believe it would be foolish for the government to ignore the wishes of the country following an unprecedented democratic referendum.

They don't have kids yet and only a few friends who have kids and are totally snooty. My daughter is 14 months.

I still nurse her to sleep and even though I'm putting her to sleep in her own bed, she wakes often and usually ends up sleeping with me. 

I really am trying to not overthink everything, as long as she's healthy and I'm getting enough sleep, I enjoy the bonus snuggle time. I work and baby goes to daycare.

I sleeptrained her once and that lasted a few weeks till a cold and teeth started coming in so that was quickly forgotten. 

I also wear her a lot. I barely use the stroller.

So my parenting is very different what she knows.

I also think that she reads too many magazines. 

So, I always get lots of comments about us being too attached and codependent. Then she's shocked that baby goes to a daycare and is absolutely fine and loves it. I think it's even better then a nanny cause she's such an extrovert and I'm not so she loves playing with other kids and exploring new places.

So many comments that start with ""aren't you afraid that..."" No I'm not afraid. Of course she's needy, she's a baby! 

If we go out for dinner, at a very European hour that happens to be past her bedtime, well we're gonna have a bad time. You can't run around the same way you used to, you have to plan naps and meals and kids to play and explore and see familiar things.

0,"It's a bit of a mess.

Labour has always been a big tent - it has had to be - but at least some Corbyn supporters seem to want to make it a lot smaller - there are e.g. people in rallies supporting Corbyn wearing shirts saying ""eradicate the right wing Blairite vermin"" and things like that, and Corbyn seemingly has no problem with having that.

It doesn't help that many of these Corbyn voters are new members of sometimes quite extreme leftist views who joined after the last GE specifically to elect Corbyn, and don't really care about the party itself. There are people who call it a coup.

There have also been complaints from older Labour activists that these new members aren't really willing to do much of the necessary leg work.

Also, I'm getting a distinct feeling from these supporters of Corbyn that they think the parliamentary Labour party should promote *their* views, not the views of the voters who elected them, and don't much care if - come next election - those voters don't vote Labour (which polls suggest many of them won't).

Corbyn himself does not come off as a very effective or politically savvy leader, and there are some serious questions concerning the EU referendum as far as he is concerned.

Unlike the Labour party, Corbyn has always been anti-EU, being part of that section of the Left who don't like the EU because they consider it a neoliberal project to promote capitalism. However the position of Labour was to support Remain. As a consequence Corbyn would proclaim to support Remain, but with the enthusiasim of a child being taken to the dentists. 

There are also some quite worrying reports trickling in how his office pretty much sabotaged the Labour's Remain campaign. This too has angered many people.

Basically many think thar Labour is impotent and unelectable as long as Corbyn and his allies hold the power.

0,"&gt; They are not able to make concessions based on their rules around trade-deals, its a binding act that ties their hands completely without unanimous agreement by every member state.

So in other words, they *are* able to make concessions on it, it's just difficult.

We're arguing in circles.

&gt; What is happening here is unprecedented

So is plenty of other things the EU has dealt with over the years. 

&gt; and the EU has to walk a fine line to get what they want but also seem harsh as to not give other states the opinion that leaving is beneficial.

We agree on that, but again this is entirely besides the point I made. Allowing for negotiations to start earlier does not imply giving anything at the negotiating table. As the examples of various recent free trade agreements show, it is highly unlikely the UK could negotiate a free trade agreement in time for the actual exit in any case, unless the UK basically rolls over on everything, so we'll get thoroughly fucked over in any case. 

&gt; We, as an EU state, are bound by EU law within which we cannot open negotiations - the EU also bound by the same law is not able to open them. 

.. unless they agree to make an exception. And so we have made full circle again.

Again, let me point out that I'm not saying this would be easy. Nor am I saying it will happen. What I said, was that it is not mutually incompatible for such a change to require a legal change and for it to be used as a scare tactic. 

That it is difficult and would require agreement of every member state does not change that.


&gt; No concessions are going to be put in place as we have already been told by Junker and the previous link I gave, to do so would go against what I have said in the above.

Are you seriously telling me that it can't happen because a *politician* has said it can't happen? You have a very different level of trust in politicians than I have.

Of course he's saying this, because if he said they would be given, he'd given up a negotiating card. He will keep saying this unless/until something has been put on his table that gives him a reason to stop saying it. That may or may not happen, but that has nothing to do with what the treaties say and everything to do with what concessions are offered.

**Everton**

Dear (SpacemasterTom)

Thank you for writing to Everton Football Club.

Everton……The best team in the world. Evertonians are born not made. You don't understand what it is to love Everton unless you actually do, they're more than just a football team.
 
The history of Everton Football Club is so much more than the players who have graced the hallowed Goodison Park turf.
 
There's more to Everton than the trophies in the cabinet; the Toffees have been constant innovators in the footballing world, ceaselessly striving to be the best, and the first to accomplish new feats, while establishing new norms. The Nil Satis Nisi Optimum (""Nothing but the best is good enough"") motto could not be more appropriate.
 
From becoming one of the founder members of the football league in 1888, right through to present day when we announced a new service which allows fans to purchase match tickets through text message,
 
Everton have always been at the forefront of new ideas.
 
Did you know we were the first to wear numbers on our backs, the first to have a purpose-built football stadium, and the first go on an overseas tour?
 
Below is an extensive list of some of the significant landmarks that Everton Football Club has accomplished since its birth. 
 

Founder members of the Football League in 1888

Founder members of the FA Premier League in 1992

First club to be presented with the League Championship trophy

First club to win a penalty shootout in the European Cup 1970 v Borussia Moenchengladbach

First club to play 4000 top-flight games

First club to amass 5000 League points

First club to stage a World Cup semi-final in Britain

First club to have the youngest Premiership goalscorer in two consecutive seasons with two different players

First club to break the £100,000 transfer threshold when Alan Ball moved from Blackpool for £110,000 in 1966.

 First club to be featured in a TV game in August 1936 v Arsenal.  Not live (pre-recorded).

First club to have scoreboard half time/full time facility

First club to have its own podcast

First club to have its own online social networking site.

First club to sell tickets via text message.

0,"&gt; I'll prefer dead, every time.

I'd pick alive.  Every time.  People in pain can heal.  Struggles can be overcome.  Things can get better.  Death is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  When taken as a measure to limit inconvenience?  Inexcusable.  This isn't primarily about the afterlife; that gives me hope for those killed.  This is about this life; what we value, and who, and why.

I don't know about things getting better ""overall"".  Every generation has its own challenges.  Things that we look back on and wonder ""Why was this allowed?  Couldn't they see what they were doing and what the consequences would be?  Were they blind?""  Slavery, Jim Crow, expansionism to the point of genocide, rapid Imperialism, excesses of the communist revolutions in Europe and China, etc.  From afar, with time and cultural distance, we can see things that were done right, and things that were done wrong.  We often think that every thing that we like or approve of in our own culture is right, though.  What will our children and grandchildren think of the people that we are, and of what we declare to be right?

Things can get better in one area and totally get worse in others.  That doesn't mean that those improvements are false, and it doesn't mean that those worsening are false. 

Take an example.  I'm a Black man and I live in the South. Racial relations in our country are improving.  Good thing.  Family ties are worsening, in particular (in my viewpoint) among Black Americans.  The fallout of this is palpable, and leads to huge impacts on family life and the larger culture with all its larger impacts, economically, educationally, aspiration-ally, politically.  Things were worse before, but some things; important, vital things, were *better*.  

Divorce is a bag of bag stuff, in my opinion.  In most cases, I can't see a significant way that this has made things better.  As a society, it seems to have hurt us, quite deeply. As a Christian, I see great spiritual significance in marriage, and am saddened by the diminished respect the union receives nowadays.   

I see that you see these changes as overall positives, and that you view the negatives as mere side effects.  I see these things as worth being discussed and fought for, though.  Can we not make things better without making things worse?  Can we not create a more perfect Union?  Isn't that what democracy is about?

""Clubs"" in Europe are also businesses and they also run like them... I understand that ""our"" teams behave differently than they do in other parts of the world, but this is largely just a matter of precedent. Teams can move because previous teams have done so. This is largely a result of how the United States grew throughout the 20th century and early relocation was almost entirely westward. Relocation has actually occurred often outside of the U.S. with varying amounts of success, but the precedent is different. Aside from relocation, ""clubs"" and ""franchises"" are the same, and the difference is largely semantic. 

Building brands outside of their home ""markets"" is something all teams do. In fact, I'd argue that Premier League clubs do this on an entirely different level than American (especially NFL) teams. Premier League brand reach is global, due primarily to soccer/football's popularity (and English's global ubiquity).

""Our"" sports culture **is** vastly different. Our professional team environment is extremely limited compared to other countries, but that's because we have sports environments aside from the professional level - namely high school and college level sports. Both of these are almost entirely nonexistent, or vastly less relevant, outside of the United States.

My main issue with the OP, was his accusation of basically all loyalty being ""manufactured"" (fake) within professional American sport, which is honestly completely ridiculous.

It most definately should have been 60/40 for a binding result buy maybe we should have ensured that. Maybe it's time we dictate to and hold accountable the career politicians and that needs to happen at home.

I voted remain but I have to say to see the look on some of the lead campaigners on both sides be exposed as playing the people. Populist politics needs to die so we can achieve longer term stability.

It's definately going to be tough but the  media are proving to the people that they are have people running our country who will say and do anything for a chance at more power and in turn exposing themselves as the propaganda machines that they are.

I would be interested in a podcast esque channel where a few leaders and MPs chat to randomly selected people from all subsections of society for a few hours, surely that would be more effective than out fundraising 70% of the time. We could even call it big brother if you want

Something needed to happen and if nothing else it's probably a good idea we voted out when we did because a lot of the UK are not ready to integrate with the EU and if that sentiment grew stronger I wouldn't be surprised if you would see greater violence with a narrow remain vote, as sad as that makes me. 

Also don't forget the Spanish and French are pretty damn eurosceptic and I will not be surprised to see more leave and then we may have a chance at creating alliances that don't piss off a large majority of the EU members.

E Elias disse a Acabe: ""Vá comer e beber, pois já ouço o barulho de chuva pesada"". Então Acabe foi comer e beber, mas Elias subiu até o alto do Carmelo, dobrou-se até o chão e pôs o rosto entre os joelhos. ""Vá e olhe na direção do mar"", disse ao seu servo. E ele foi e olhou. ""Não há nada lá"", disse ele. Sete vezes Elias mandou: ""Volte para ver"". Na sétima vez o servo disse: ""Uma nuvem tão pequena quanto a mão de um homem está se levantando do mar"". Então Elias disse: ""Vá dizer a Acabe: Prepare o seu carro e desça, antes que a chuva o impeça"". Enquanto isso, nuvens escuras apareceram no céu, começou a ventar e começou a chover forte, e Acabe partiu de carro para Jezreel. (1 Reis 18:1; 41-45)

Você sabe como falar com Deus? Você quer ouvir o som da chuva? Insista em oração! Eu acho interessante essa história porque Elias está lá quebrantado, orando, aí ele chama o servo: vá lá ver se tem algum sinal dos céus, se já caiu uma garoa, alguma coisa. Aí o servo sai, olha pro céu, azulzinho, não tem nada. Aí volta, e diz para Elias: ""acho que não deu certo"". Elias nem dá bola para o servo, continua orando, passa mais um tempo e ele diz: ""rapaz, vai lá de novo dar uma olhada"". Então o servo vai, olha, e diz: ""Elias, nada"". Aí ele faz a terceira vez, a quarta vez, a quinta vez. Quando chegou na sexta acho que o servo já estava pensando: ""Puxa, ele não desiste"". Na sétima, ele viu um sinalzinho lá em cima. E ele volta para contar. E sabe o que isso me ensina? Você quer ouvir o som da chuva? Você quer andar por fé? Você quer saber como falar com Deus? Você quer entender o que Deus tem preparado para a sua vida, para a tua família? Meu irmão, insista, persevere. Tem muita gente aqui que fala para mim: ""Ah, eu não entendo, Deus não fala comigo. Eu escuto o povo falando que na igreja Deus fala, Deus não fala comigo. Não sei como falar com Deus. Eu devo ter alguma urucubaca, algum negócio."" Aí dizem: ""Pastor, faz uma oração de libertação para ver se eu entendo as coisas de Deus."" Querido, a questão não é essa. A questão é que, por vezes, a gente tem que insistir, e tem muita gente aqui que não escuta a voz de Deus porque não tem vida de oração. Você ora na hora do almoço. ""Senhor, obrigado pela refeição, faça mal ou faça bem, em nome de Jesus amém."" Aí antes de dormir, para desencargo de consciência, você dá aquela oradinha também: ""Senhor, obrigado pelo dia, e tal, não sei o que."" E aí essa é a nossa vida de oração e aí você quer que Deus fale contigo? Desse jeito você não vai entender nada meu irmão. Sabe por que? A gente tem que ter um compromisso diário com o Senhor. E insistir para que Deus traga revelação. Vejam homens de Deus como Daniel. Acho interessante que em determinado momento Daniel queria que Deus lhe mostrasse algo e Bíblia diz que ele ora durante 21 dias e jejua pedindo a revelação de Deus. Mas essa revelação não vem e demora e aí, em determinado momento, depois de ele insistir, vem um anjo do Senhor e fala: ""olha, estava acontecendo uma batalha espiritual, mas você insistiu em oração e agora eu estou aqui, como o recado de Deus para você."" Daniel sabia como falar com Deus. Querido, tem que insistir! Eu gosto de Jacó. Às vezes a gente tem que entrar e falar assim: ""Senhor, eu não saio da tua presença aqui se o Senhor não me revelar."" Veio um anjo, ele agarrou no pé do anjo e falou: ""Não vai embora, eu quero que o Senhor se revele."" Queridos, quantos aqui não têm uma vida de oração? Não separam um lugar, nem um tempo para ouvir Deus falar. E aí estão chutando as coisas na vida, porque não têm essa intimidade com o Senhor. Você quer ouvir o som do céu? Você quer saber o que Deus tem preparado? Você quer andar por fé, ver os milagres de Deus? Comece a orar! Comece a insistir! Comece a separar tempo, e levar isso a sério, e as coisas de Deus vão começar a acontecer na tua vida! Insiste! Elias fez assim, homens de Deus fazem assim.

One thing you can do is help craft an essay to deliver to the UN, something that exposes not just the provable medical and psychological merits of mushrooms but the urgent demand to reintegrate them back into our religious traditions.  And also claim it as a personal right, a right as a consumer (ie: if they can buy politics, why can't we buy drugs?--more to the point, if 'money is speech' and speech is free then I should be able to 'buy drugs as an act of free speech').  

Finally, it would be helpful to say to the UN that if their charge is to 'be the tide that raises all ships', and that they are generally an aristocratic NGO having a hegelian philosophy of 'alchemy' and gnosticism at it's core, behind the facade of secular humanism and religious ecumenical relativism (ie: 'coexist'), you force them get them to get real with who they are and who funded them and to whom and why power flows.

about white people and psychedelics


Did you know that white people used ayahuasca at one time in history?  They did it was called 'soma'.  No one knows what it is, but it's theorized by several it was either at type of ergot that did'nt cause ergotism (st anthonys fire / st vitis dance) or more likely a mushroom.  Some say amanita muscaria or psilocybin cubensis.  However, neither would grow in the near/middle east with the current arid climate, so either these were coming from some incredibly lush area with cattle (India, possibly Iran/Iraq--ancient mesopotamia) or being traded from more european area or ancient russian people.  Amanita muscaria and psilocybe are 'cosmopolitcan fungi' meaning 'everywhere', however, amanitas like conifer forests and temperate conditions, whereas psilocybe prefer wet tropical and subtropical meadows; there may have been a 'sweet spot' in northern areas of turkey, afghanistan, etc.  Greece and egypt as I understand are far too arid for mushrooms",False,False,t5_2qh4r,conspiracy,,6,911bodysnatchers322,0,1467391414,1471139015,6,,t3_4qslpi,t3_4qslpi,,d4vj03q

**2010** EU&amp;Ukraine protected him from Russia 

UKRAINE: UKRAINE OBLIGED TO HALT EXTRADITION: AHMED CHATAEV : FURTHER INFORMATION 

On 14 January 2010 the European Court of Human Rights called upon the Ukrainian authorities not to extradite an ethnic Chechen man, Ahmed Chataev, to Russia until further notice. Ahmed Chataev has been granted refugee status in Austria and was visiting the Ukraine with a valid visa when he was arrested on January 3. Amnesty International believes that if he is returned to Russia, he could face an unfair trial and would be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment.

**2011** Bulgaria protected him from Russia 

Bulgaria refuses to extradite Chechen man to Russia 

A court in Bulgaria on Thursday granted an appeal by a Chechen refugee against his extradition to Russia where he is wanted on charges of terrorism.

The court of appeal in Plovdiv granted Ahmed Chataev -- who was detained by police on the Bulgarian-Turkish border on May 19 -- his appeal against an earlier extradition order issued by the regional court in Haskovo.

The Plovdiv court ruled that Chataev's refugee status, which he was granted in Austria in 2003, remains valid in all countries signatory to the Geneva Convention which include Bulgaria.

Chataev is wanted in Chechnya for ""participation in an armed group and for the recruitment of persons for terrorist crimes and for financing terrorism.""

**2012** Georgia protected him from Russia 

Georgian special forces detain one of militants hiding in Lopota gorge 

According to a short statement published on Saturday, Akhmet Chatayev, Russian citizen from the North Caucasus was arrested the same day. According to the statement he was a member of an armed group. The detainee was injured and hospitalized, but is now in good health now, according to the interior ministry. Chatayev, who is wanted in Russia, has political asylum in Austria, but has spent the last two years in Georgia, during which time he got married. He is the Caucaus insurgents’ spokesperson in Europe. Ekho Kavkaza writes that it is unclear how he could be part of a group of fighters, as he lost his arm above the elbow during the second Chechen war. The ministry continues its search operation in a valley near the border. The ministry started a special operation in the area near the village Lapankuri on August 31. In total, fourteen people died, among them two law enforcers, one military doctor, and eleven so-called saboteurs. The interior ministry has identified seven out of eleven dead rebels; two Georgians and five Russians. Three of them have been buried in Pankisi Valley, where many Chechens sought refuge during the two Chechen wars.

Ahmed Chataev in Georgia acknowledged guiltless 

City court of Tbilisi acquitted citizen of the Russian Federation Ahmed Chataev detained during a special operation in Lopota gorge, lawyer Nino Andriashvili reported. 

“The court decided to acquit Chataev after Public Prosecutor exculpated him completely”, Andriashvili said. 

Chataev was detained in September of 2012 in Lopota gorge where the Ministry of Interior Affairs of Georgia was carrying out an operation of liquidation of gunmen. He was incriminated in illegal storage of an explosive device. His attorneys called the charges unlawful stating that Chataev arrived in Lopota gorge for negotiation and was detained. 

According to Chataev, three witnesses who were frontier guards came to the trail on January, 18. “It was them who found me. They said I had no grenades”, “Novosti-Georgia” quotes him. 

He said that after that he was planning to go to Austria where he had a political refugee status, “Georgia Online” reports.

Ethnic Chechen Ahmed Chataev had a wanted notice from law enforcement bodies who considered him leader of gunmen Doku Umarov’s representative in Western Europe since 2003. The Ministry of Interior Affairs of the Russian Federation placed the information of Chataev in the Interpol database, however the Ministry of Justice of Georgia refused to extradite Chataev to Russia.

And that's because nations like France and Germany still had small arms requirements on the books for overall barrel length so that men could fire in two lines without disturbing each other.  To make things worse, this would carry on into rifles being developed in 1915 and 1916.  

France felt the need to introduce a new, [long barrel Berthier in 1915](http://candrsenal.com/wp-content/gallery/primer/France%20Rifle%201915%20Berthier%20Mle07-15%20Full.png) when the usual was [much handier](http://candrsenal.com/wp-content/gallery/primer/French-Rifle-1890-Berthier-Mle1890-Full.png).

0,"Primarily the narrative of humble colonists shucking the yoke of Imperialist taxation without representation, which itself is a form of propaganda. 

It's hopelessly high school to haughtily point out that the Revolution was organized, encouraged, and done in the interests of what was effectively the first entrenched generation of ""native"" oligarchs to the continent but that *was* one of the primary driving forces.... even so there is a large degree of truth to the story of ""freedom"" as the continental armies were not solely made of soldiers brought by the French.

As has been said the USA *was* also a nation where the notion of ""freedom"" is heavily baked into the foundation of our governing texts.  

From there you just have the rolling effect of 200 or so years of further propaganda, exacerbated by conflicts such as the Civil War and WWII which are easily framed (again with a heavy degree of truth) as the liberation of slaves and the halting of tyranny, respectively. There is very good reason those two conflicts get heavy airplay in the public education curriculum. 

-----------------------

I do mean propaganda by the way. I am being unambiguous. The notion that the United States is the most free country in the world is absolutely a form of propaganda. It is every bit as much propaganda as the Imperial Japanese propaganda that US soldiers eat babies or that North Korea needs to subscribe to their glorious leaders in the Un family. It is a form of shared social values acting as a method of control. That does *not* make it evil, necessarily, nor even untrue, but it is a way to keep citizens relatively in line with their sense of national values and as such holds a high potential for corruption and abuse both on the micro (citizens misinterpreting or too strongly embracing) and macro (outright lies to manipulate the citizenry into actions against their best interest).

--------------------------------

And then you have the fact that little things like the Spanish-American War and the US' *abominable* treatment of South America in pursuit of their own economic interests (which can and should create an uneasy feeling in US citizens as a lot of our prosperity can be tied to the resources gained from said exploitation)... 

...things like our alliance with Stalin and the USSR's overwhelming contributions of casualties to defeat the Third Reich are also swept under the rug because it wrinkles the notion that the US *always* sides with capital F freedom and any other nation is unwilling to make great sacrifices... 

... things like Britain, France, and most of Western Europe's own crimes like the Scramble for Africa (which the US participated in) as well as Britain's own imperial black marks...

... are largely swept under the rug in public education, often available only as topics for AP learners, self-studies, collegiate education, and if you're lucky through local historical sources such as family or community members. 

-----

And well, not to be elitist or arrogant but guess what kind-of person espouses the whole ""freedom"" notion both the hardest and the most unironically? They're not usually AP learners, self-studies, or college graduates. Even very capable, intelligent individuals may simply not have had the opportunities nor resources to even *be* those things. 

And **then** you have the ugly truth that many of the people who go on about ""freedom"" in the US as leaders tend to do so because it is a malleable virtue that rouses crowds towards their own interests. 

This isn't to say that when someone intones the notion of ""the most free country on earth"" to get a crowd to buy flags they aren't being sincere, but it is a form of persuasive leverage the same way other demographics can be swayed by things like demographic representation. Couple that with value systems that prioritize what ""category"" you belong to as much by what you *hate* as what you *like*, and you end up with a partnership to a very vague notion of Freedom that borderlines on zealotry.

I source this on the broad strokes of what is publicly accepted knowledge on world events, coupled with my own collegiate education in World History, US Afro-American history, Latin American history, and Modern African History.

Oh, don't worry. This isn't really German for the most part. They are German words, that are arranged according to the grammatical sentence structure of the German language, but it's political-/lawyer-gobbledigook. Everything can be read several different ways, so lawyers and politicians are needed, to translate it into actual language. That's one way of securing your own job I guess.

&gt; but if this is true

Sadly it is. This is the relevant passage:

&gt; ""Über die Vorgaben der Richtlinie 2014/40/EU hinaus werden durch dieses Gesetz nikotinfreie elektronische Zigaretten und Nachfüllbehälter den nikotinhaltigen gleichgestellt, soweit dies zum Schutz der Verbraucherinnen und Verbraucher vor Gesundheitsschäden erforderlich ist.""

It says that beyond what was defined by the EU directive, this additional law will treat nicotine-free e-cigarettes and refill containers the same as those with nicotine, as far as it is needed to secure the safety of the population. In the big passage thereafter it is explained why it is needed to secure the safety of the population.

&gt; It make no sense to not challenge this. Please challenge it.

Our national version of the TPD has some sneaky parts to it, as I'm sure the versions in other countries also have. Our ministry tasked with implementing and overseeing the national tobacco law has been granted several special privileges to change and add on to the new law. In this case they just have to coordinate with two other ministries and get the changes through the Bundesrat.

So an egghead with an axe to grind asks two other eggheads, who don't have any clue about the matter, if he can regulate something and then goes to get it approved by a board of eggheads with no clue. I'm sure our German advocacy group is planning to challenge this, but it will be a long strenuous process. Because there is another sneaky part in our national tobacco law: The testing methods for the danger of e-cigarettes are defined by the eggheads with an axe to grind. You can't just do a study under normal conditions that would resemble the way people actually use e-cigarettes and use it to support your argument.

Which it does, because E.U. borders are wide open thanks to Angela Merkel's absurd immigration policy - passed unilaterally by her country but which drags every other E.U. member state along regardless of their citizens' democratic consent of this policy.

&gt;2\. The entire ideology of ISIS relies upon the idea that Islam is locked in a millenarian struggle with Rome I.e. the West - nationalist and anti-Muslim sentiment in the West directly improves their ability to recruit disaffected Muslims for their caliphate.

Until that is rectified, I see no reason why Western nations should open their borders.

Seriously, your argument *is literally* that ""they'll be violent if we don't let them into *our* countries,"" ignoring that they're not exactly keen on letting *us* into *their* countries, and on the infrequent occasion in which they do, Western immigrants to broadly-Muslim countries are expected to assimilate *quickly*.

0,"Combat helmets were reinstated through application of military science.

In the Napoleonic era, the main creator of casualties were direct fire weapons, essentially things that you would point directly at a target and shoot. Napoleonic field guns were essentially direct fire weapons as well, firing solid shots at a low angle.

Indirect fire weapons are weapons that are launched at a trajectory, launched into the air and dropping down on their targets. Prior to WWI, such weapons are used in sieges to drop stuff over walls.

Solid projectiles in the 19th century like musket balls and cannonballs were too powerful to stop economically with armor. Even today, combat helmets couldn't save you from a direct hit from an artillery shell, or even a modestly powerful bullet. 

However, Combat helmets do protect from falling debris and low velocity metal. In WWI, entrenched infantry were mostly safe from direct fire (aside from the unlucky direct shell), but they could easily be hit by metal and torn-up ground debris hitting them from above. After helmets were introduced, deaths due to head trauma plummeted (Injuries due to head trauma concurrently went up, up, up).

But artillery was still incredibly powerful. Even in WWII artillery accounted for something like 70% of casualties.
 
So how did nobody plan accordingly? One reason is that there were 40 years between WWI and the Franco-Prussian War, the last big war between European states. Artillery was a big killer during that war, but it wasn't the main killer. Furthermore, those artillery guns were still mainly direct fire weapons, just with exploding shells that were more deadly that solid cannonballs. 

In those 40 years, targeting systems became reliable and widespread, gun ranges got longer and longer, and explosive power got higher. Machine guns are what we see when we imagine horrific industrial warfare, but it really should be artillery.

&gt;There were two main problems with the engine: the smoky exhaust and the pollution it produced – nine times the hydrocarbons and five times the carbon monoxide emissions of the average European car of 2007. The fuel consumption was 7 l/100 km (40 mpg-imp; 34 mpg-US).[9] Since the engine did not have an oil injection system, two-stroke oil had to be added to the 24-liter (6.3 U.S. gal; 5.3 imp gal) fuel tank[10] every time the car was filled up, at a 50:1 or 33:1 ratio of fuel to oil. Gas stations of the time, in countries where two-stroke engines were common, served premixed gas-oil mixture from the pump. Today, owners carry a container of two-stroke oil in the car for this purpose. Because the car lacked a fuel pump, the fuel tank had to be placed above the motor in the engine compartment so that fuel could be fed to the carburetor by gravity; a trade-off of this design was an increased fire risk in front-end accidents. Earlier models had no fuel gauge; a dipstick was inserted into the tank to determine how much fuel remained.

0,"&gt; Nej-siden oplagde jo flere gang til at de ville skifte til ja, hvis afstemningen var kun om retsforbeholdet til Europol, og ikke alle retsforbeholdene.

Sådan en afstemning er bare teoretisk umulig, da vi så skal have en ny folkeafstemning hver gang der laves en lille ændring i lovgivningen. Det vil være meget teknisk og en øvelse i pointeløshed at afholde flere folkeafstemninger årligt for at kunne være med i europol. Lovgivning kan også være blandet sammen og bliver ikke nødvendigvis opdelt i en ""europol"" og en ""ikke-europol"" kasse. Samtidig giver det mening hvis EU ønsker at vi også overholder praksis for EU-lovgivning hvis vi skal være med, så den ide bliver heller ikke nødvendigvis godkendt af EU.

Hele ideen om en afstemning om en afstemning kun om europol er bare noget nej-partierne fandt på, og hele konceptet er lige så absurd som at Storbritannien skulle kunne få 350 millioner pund om ugen, beholde alle fordelene ved EU og smide polakkerne ud ved at forlade EU.

&gt; Hele afstemningen var fokuseret om Europol fra ja-siden, hvor de prøvede at ikke at nævne at det handlede om alle retsforbeholdene. At give regeringen lov til at styre dem alle fremover, uden afstemninger. Så faktisk set kunne vores politikere vælge euroen uden befolkningens accept, havde det været et ja.

Der var kun tale om en tilvalgsordning på retsområdet. Forbeholdene for forsvar, euro og unionsborgerskab var derfor ikke berørte af afstemningen.
