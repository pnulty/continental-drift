Cards like [[Counterspell]], [[Lightning bolt]], [[Unsummon]], etc. can pave the way for your creature to get through. Good efficient creatures you might find as a newer player could be the Standard legal [[Monastery Swiftspear]], the Modern legal [[Delver of Secrets]] and [[Young Pyromancer]].

,"Dear reddit, you sadden me. Germany, as well as Sweden, lives up to the same resolutions signed by all western countries after the second world war - you HAVE to open your borders to refugees, and if you're in doubt about whether or not they're 'real' refugees, you're obliged to house them until their case has been run. 

Germany of all countries, cannot run from this obligation (like so many other western countries), both due to a strong national feeling of order, and their own history.

I find it sickening to see so many of you dear redditors jumping on a muslim hatetrain, without even considering who and what these people are fleeing from - the result of several middle eastern wars involving the US and several European countries. We created this shit, we didn't finish a thing over there, and yet we hate the people fleeing from daily bombings, risking their life to reach a better place.

Yes, I do agree that some of these people aren't refugees, but using anecdotal evidence of this to support a dehumanizing hate of these refugees, is wrong on so many levels. The majority seems to be refugees, we agreed to help refugees back in 1946, and I applaud Germany for sticking to that agreement - while we see so many other countries backing out due to the refugees having another religion (while fleeing from the very people they're being painted as).",worldnews,0,-1,Grothas,-1,False,1446336476,t3_3qyn4m,t5_2qh13,cwjya4l,t3_3qyn4m,,1447322672,,0,

Allegedly a working steam engine was invented in China 500+ years before James Watt invented it in Britain. The proud inventor presented it to the emperor. 

The Emperor immediately ordered the steam engine destroyed, all plans destroyed and the inventor killed. 

A typical reaction would be how could the emperor be so stupid ? 

The emperor when asked why he did that replied that devil contraption will put millions of peasants out of work. With no work there will be a revolt. 

Is the story true ? Possibly China could make mechanical clocks hundreds of years before Europeans, they had printing presses, natural gas wells, natural gas pipelines. When Marco Polo came back from China and described things, Europeans thought he was lying. 

So from the emperor's perspective killing the inventor was a smart thing to do. Sucks if you where a peasant. The emperor like the Russian Czar was an absolute monarch.

,"Hey there. Atiba plays as one of the two defensive midfielders in Beşiktaş' 4-2-3-1 . Fans like him a lot.

He is clearly our sole player that has no alternative because he's really unique. One con about him is that his support to forward is around zero (doesn't play through pass,cross, no goals or assists too) in the opponent's third but midfield and defence are really his playgrounds.

,"You're partially correct, too.

Here's the etymology from the OED, the relevant paragraph emboldened:

&gt; Anglo-Norman and Middle French orenge (c1393 in Middle French; earlier in Anglo-Norman in phrase pume orenge (c1200), 1314 in Old French in phrase pomme d'orenge: see note below), Middle French, French orange (1515 as noun in a translation from Italian (itself translating a Portuguese source), 1553 as adjective), ultimately (probably, in spite of the chronology, via Italian arancio (c1309), arancia (a1336; also as †narancia (1598 in Florio); Italian regional (Venice) naranza, Italian regional (Reggio Emilia) naranz, Italian regional (Milan) narans) &lt; Arabic nāranj &lt; Persian nārang &lt; Sanskrit nāraṅga &lt; a Dravidian language: compare Tamil nāram, Tulu nāreṅgi. Compare also Persian nār &lt; anār pomegranate. Compare Spanish naranja (late 14th cent.), Portuguese laranja (1377), Old Occitan arange (c1373), irange (1390), medieval Greek νεράντζιον.
In Anglo-Norman pume orenge and Old French pomme d'orenge , probably after Italian melarancio (although this is first attested later: 14th cent.) &lt; mela apple (see mele n.1) + arancio orange tree, orange (see above); compare post-classical Latin pomum arantiae (1297), Italian pomerancia , and German Pomeranze (15th cent.; &lt; Italian), and compare also Older Scots appil orange (see Dict. Older Sc. Tongue s.v.) and Dutch oranjeappel . Initial o- in the Anglo-Norman and Old French forms is probably after the form of the place name Orange (see Orange n.2; compare forms in d' ), perhaps also influenced by Anglo-Norman and Old French or gold (see or n.1), with reference to the colour. Similarly, post-classical Latin has aurantia (1609, 1626 in British sources; compare later aurantia n.), by association with classical Latin aurum gold (see auro- comb. form), beside arangia (Sicily, 12th cent.), arancia (15th cent.), arantia (16th cent.).

&gt; **The loss of initial n- in French and Italian probably results from absorption of the n- when preceded by the indefinite article, although in some cases such forms may reflect loss of n- already in Arabic. Conversely, the 19th-cent. Scots form nirrange shows attraction of the -n of the indefinite article by metanalysis (see N n.).**
 
&gt; The native home of the orange may have been south-east Asia, and the name may have originated there. In the Middle Ages the bitter (or Seville) orange was brought by the Arabs to Sicily, from where it spread to the rest of Europe. The sweet (or China) orange was brought from China by the Portuguese in the 16th cent.
 
&gt; The designations for certain varieties of pear (see senses A. 1b, Special uses 3 , ) are attested earlier in French than in English: with winter orange (in quot. 1800 at sense A. 1b) compare French orange d'hiver (1690); with orange musk and orange pear at Special uses 3 compare French orange musquée (1690) and poire d'orange (1603) respectively.
 
&gt; Compare the following surnames, which may reflect the Anglo-Norman or the Middle English word (or perhaps even the place name Orange n.2, in Old French Orenge): Sibel Orenge (1296), Ricardo Orenge (1296–7), Galfridus Orenge (1310).",todayilearned,0,2,Logofascinated,2,False,1446339158,t1_cwjtfxd,t5_2qqjc,cwjzjpb,t3_3qyhzv,,1447323267,,0,

,"&gt; Is there any reason to rule out a religious motive?

Jerusalem/Israel has always been viewed as the historical ""Homeland"" by Jews - religiously, ethnically and culturally, so there is little doubt as to why that this is the LOCATION they chose for the Zionist Conquest. There has been an underlying ""sentimental yearning"" for the Jews to ""return"", in both religious and cultural traditions, and religion was no doubt the primary motive for the maintenance of a presence of Jews in Palestine over the centuries, and the impetus that sparked several earlier (but largely failed) [Aliyah movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah).

In the case of the Zionism we know today, religion was definitely **NOT** the primary driving factor. [Theodor Herzl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl), the so-called ""Founding Father"" of modern Zionism was an avowed atheist, as was [David Ben-Gurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion), the man who spearheaded the Zionist movement from 1915 onward, eventually becoming Israel's first Prime Minister.

These and many other Jews involved in early Zionism flatly rejected the religious aspects of Judaism, but continued to strongly identify with the ***""Jewish race""*** (a term that was used openly by Herzl and many of his contemporaries). The Zionist vision for a new Israel was that it would be a SECULAR society, and while they made no serious attempts to BAN Jewish religion (a move which would have been a deal-breaker to many potential immigrants), it was not religion, but race/ethnicity/heritage that formed the identity by which Jews were to be bound in brotherhood.

If you read Herzl's ***[Der Judenstaat](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25282/25282-h/25282-h.htm)*** (translated full text at link), you will see that Herzl's **stated** motivation for forming a ""Jewish State"" was as a refuge from persecution and ""anti-Semitism"", which he saw as an inexplicable plague that Jews had always suffered throughout history, and from which, he claimed, there was no alternative escape. 

QUOTING HERZL:

&gt; The Jewish question exists wherever Jews live in perceptible numbers. Where it does not exist, it is carried by Jews in the course of their migrations. **We naturally move to those places where we are not persecuted, and there our presence produces persecution.** This is the case in every country, and will remain so, even in those highly civilized—for instance, France—until the Jewish question finds a solution on a political basis. **The unfortunate Jews are now carrying the seeds of Anti-Semitism into England; they have already introduced it into America**.

&gt; I believe that I understand Anti-Semitism, which is really a highly complex movement. I consider it from a Jewish standpoint, yet without fear or hatred. I believe that I can see what elements there are in it of vulgar sport, of common trade jealousy, of inherited prejudice, of religious intolerance, and also of pretended self-defence. I think the Jewish [76]question is no more a social than a religious one, notwithstanding that it sometimes takes these and other forms. It is a national question, which can only be solved by making it a political world-question to be discussed and settled by the civilized nations of the world in council.

&gt; **We are a people—one people.**

[...]

&gt; Oppression and persecution cannot exterminate us. No nation on earth has survived such struggles and sufferings as we have gone through. Jew-baiting has merely stripped off our weaklings; **the strong among us were invariably [77]true to their race when persecution broke out against them. This attitude was most clearly apparent in the period immediately following the emancipation of the Jews. Those Jews who were advanced intellectually and materially entirely lost the feeling of belonging to their race.** Wherever our political well-being has lasted for any length of time, we have assimilated with our surroundings.

As you can see, while Herzl (naturally) makes allusions to the Jewish religion, it is far from being his primary focus, nor is it called out as being the glue that binds Jews together ""as a people"", rather it is the Jewish ""race"" that is mentioned repeatedly, and there seems little doubt that it is this ""racial"" quality that he and his fellows sought to preserve. 

Reiterating from the above: *""Those Jews who were advanced intellectually and materially entirely lost the feeling of* ***belonging to their race***.""*

Herzl makes repeated complaints against anti-Semitism, of persecution against Jews because of *who they are*, and uses this as his primary ""call to arms"", as it were, but there is a problem with this line of thought: At the time of Herzl's writing, **[Jewish Emancipation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_emancipation)** was nearly universal, at least in Europe, and Jews were making tremendous strides in being accepted as full members of society by their non-Jewish contemporaries. Increasingly, they were **FULLY ASSIMILATING** into the nations and cultures in which they lived, and ironically, German Jews were perhaps the most welcome and ASSIMILATED of all Jews.

**But was this a blessing, or a curse?**

Through 2,000 years of Diaspora, Jews had largely lived separate lives as a separate (but groundless) **nation**. They were a PEOPLE WITHIN A PEOPLE (or peoples) wherever they dwelt, and intermixing, intermingling was strictly limited by Gentile - **and especially by Jewish** - laws and customs. Intermarriage? Forget it. **Verboten**. During much of this time (the Rabbinical Era) Jewish communities were largely self-governed - at least in their internal affairs - and they had, by contract, minimal political attachment to any gentile nation in which they dwelt. They were virtually always exempt from military service and other obligations placed on their gentile neighbors, and generally, they, as a community, had certain rights and responsibilities **as contractually negotiated** with the lords and rulers of any given land in which they dwelt. 

Under these circumstances, maintaining one's **Jewish identity** was a no-brainer, as such was *enforced* by both custom and law from inside *and* outside of the community.

With the arrival of Jewish Emancipation, things changed, and DRASTICALLY. Restrictions that had formerly been placed on Jews were relaxed or eliminated entirely, and these new ""liberties"" enabled Jews to mingle, socially, politically and in commerce, in ways that they never had before. 

Gone was the notion of ""Jewish Nationalism"", and Jews were increasingly seen as Germans, or Frenchmen, or Englishmen (or what have you) of the ""Jewish faith"", or the ""Jewish Confession"". Intermarriage became commonplace, with the offspring thereof often being raised with little or no sentimental connection to their ""Jewish roots"". 

Depending on one's perspective, this was seen as either a marvelous success, or as an **unmitigated disaster**; for while the Gentile nations, by an large, welcomed this assimilation - this loss of foreign identity, the Jewish leaders saw it as a sure path to the EXTINCTION of Jews AS A PEOPLE. 

There was then, and is today, a very real fear that Jews will become EXTINCT, not due to any pogrom, persecution, or Holocaust, but via ASSIMILATION: That Jews will ""disappear"" by fully acclimating to and blending in with the Gentile nations, and simply ""forget"" that they ARE JEWS.

In the view of many Jews then and now, extinction is extinction, regardless of whether is come by violence, or by attrition. It doesn't matter. 

**[SEE HERE](https://www.google.com/search?q=greatest+threat%3A+Assimilation&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8)**

**In summary**, I do not believe that religion was the impetus for modern Zionism, and contrary to Herzl's claims, I do not believe that it was driven by fear of ""anti-Semitism"". Rather, it seems abundantly clear that THE GREAT FEAR that drove the Zionist leaders to commit such vast resources and make such astounding sacrifices of treasure, blood and misery, was the fear of ASSIMILATION: That Jews, left to their own devices in an increasingly accepting and accommodating world, would **forget that they ARE Jews**, and ""die"" quietly by forgetting their unique heritage and mingling their *precious blood* with that of the Gentile nations.

My parents, in a city of over 50,000, didn't see any digital service until 2002, when Verizon introduced CDMA in their area.

The royal family escaped when Napoleon's forces approached Lisbon in late 1807.

At the time, Brazil was Portugal's largest and most successful colony, and Rio was its administrative capital, and wealthiest city.  Rio was the natural choice for the family to hide out in during the war.

The unintended consequence, though, was that by making Rio the capital of a global Empire, it gave the Brazilian people - primarily the aristocracy - a taste of autonomy.  The Portuguese Royal Family remained in Brazil until a military uprising in Portugal in 1820-21 drew them back to Europe.  When they left, however, it left things open for Brazilian ""liberals"" - large landowners and merchants to foment a movement for Brazilian independence.  After a series of missteps by the Portuguese Cortes - their legislature - and the Portuguese military in Brazil, a member of that Royal Family, Dom Pedro, was able to ride a wave of nationalism to being coronated as Emperor of Brazil.

&gt;&gt;So no, Sweden does not have the same rape frequencies as Lesotho.


The fact of the matter is that in Sweden **Violent crime has increased by 300% and rapes by 1,472%**. Sweden is now number two on the list of rape countries, surpassed only by a third world  hellhole which is Lesotho in Southern Africa.

The definition changing would never give such a extreme results like these since 99% of people are not inclined to falsely report such huge number of rapes, when **Sweden has never had a problem with rampant rape/crime  before it became a multicultural hellhole**. You can see rapes and criminal activity rising in every european country which publish these statistics including swedens neighboring countries.

,"&gt;Yep, I have. I understand it's difficult to live well when the CIA topples your regional governments once every few years, installs dictators in your lands, and equips their secret police with exciting new torture techniques.

That's just excuses. The Middle East was a mess long before the CIA even existed and it will be continue to be a mess as long as the people of the ME continue to assign blame to others instead of placing it where it belongs, on their own shoulders.

&gt;The recent decades of instability in the Middle East are largely attributable to Western fuckery.

No?

The recent decades of instability in the ME (And long before that) happened because most of the ME is still living in the 12th  century tribal mindset.

Even one of the more ""advanced"" countries in the ME, Iran is a nutjob Islamic theocracy that hangs homosexuals and has criminal penalties for adultery. 

&gt;Imagine how shit their lives must be, if they're willing to die just to kill a few of you?

If they spent less effort to kill others but instead focused on doing something positive we wouldn't be having this discussion.

Lots of people live shitty lives and yet we don't see Ukrainians blowing up bus stations or skyscrapers which is probably why in 20 or 30 years the Ukrainians will be relatively well off while most of the ME will still be wallowing in self pity and blaming the US and the Jews for their own incompetence.

&gt;Or here's a crazy thought: they might want to prosper under their own terms, and not have foreign values bombed into them.

The problem is that it is their own values that impede progress if they actually accepted western values the ME would have been a military and economic power house instead of the shithole that most of it is right now.

&gt;The Middle East as a whole? Certainly not. Militarily they're inept, socially they're divided, and economically they're addicted.

On that at least we agree.

&gt;But for every million of them, there are one or two Bin Ladens.

It's kind off horrifying to see people openly supporting terrorism like this but then again this is an open forum.

Still you should take a long and honest look at yourself and decide if you really want to be the kind of person who justifies violence against innocent people.

&gt; I don't think they'll settle for mere airliners next time.

As cold as it might sound I hope they don't settle for airliners either. The more events like 9/11 there will be in the US/EU the less support Muslims will enjoy from the general population of the West and once popular opinion changes the politicians will quickly follow.

Coupled with the decline of the importance of oil for the economy of the West I believe that we will get to see the ME once again become a meaningless desert that nobody gives a shit about just like it was less than a century ago.

&gt; &amp;quot;I fell in love with the flat and was initially looking to borrow over 35 years, but the only way I could get a mortgage was to agree to a 40-year term. Otherwise, the lenders said I couldn&amp;#039;t afford my mortgage repayments.""

&gt; The Council of Mortgage Lenders said the proportion of borrowers taking out loans in excess of 25 years had doubled in the past five years, to about a third of all mortgages.

&gt; After the credit crunch, cheap &amp;quot;Interest-only&amp;quot; mortgages were in effect banned by regulators, so mortgage brokers have instead advised buyers to stretch their repayment terms.

,"Oh dear God.  You don't get it?  HFT completely fucks over everybody who isn't one.  Completely.

Back to basics.  HFT is a way to probe somebody else's computer and figure out exactly to the micropenny what it is set to buy or sell at, without doing a real trade.  It doesn't matter if the target/victim is another crook doing HFT or not.  Could be a union's pension fund.  Once that information is stolen, real trading begins...except it happens with a disparity of information between the two parties.  The guy with more info wins.  Always.

Now, I say ""stolen"" because the house rules for this gambling den laid out by the SEC say you cannot offer to buy or sell stock without actually intending to do so - and at that price.  HFT pisses all over that rule but the people doing it are (so far) too politically connected to touch, just like Jon Corzine was at MF Global when he stole billions and never got arrested.

Tons of other fraud in the financial markets is being ignored in the US alone, even more in China (holy shit!) and Europe.  It's all extensively documented, fr'instance:

http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/public/_files/Financial_Crisis/FinancialCrisisReport.pdf

I have a theory as to WTF is going on.  I think the megabanks have quietly told Obama that if he allows prosecution of financial fraud they'll use their influence at the federal reserve bank to raise interest rates and trigger a depression.  Mind you, Obama's lax treatment of Corzine who isn't a major player who could make that kind of threat suggests it didn't take much to get Obama to back down.

 The claim that the Bulgar peoples are opressed is just lacking in knowledge of our history, we aren't adepts of the idea of despotic monarchy or a rightless people. We adhere to certain freedoms, and for our people these freedoms are enough.

 [artist pic](http://img2-ak.lst.fm/i/u/252/734e1900b32f468cb2efb40bece094fe.png)  

&gt; Michael Lington has demonstrated his contemporary saxophone chops with a steady stream of chart-toppers since his debut album in 1997.  His CD, Stay with Me, yielded three Radio &amp; Records national jazz hits with “Show Me” at # 2; “Two of a Kind” at # 2; and “Pacifica” at # 6.  Stay With Me also remained on the Billboard contemporary jazz chart for a total of 24 weeks. “Twice In a Lifetime” and “Sunset” from Vivid; and “Still Thinking of You” from Lington’s Everything Must Change all went Top 5 as well.  His duet with Bobby Caldwell on “Tell It Like It Is” from his self-titled debut, ascended both the jazz and adult contemporary charts. 

&gt; Now Michael is back with A SONG FOR YOU, his second Rendezvous recording.  In collaboration with Rendezvous , Grammy nominated arranger  and composer Randy Waldman and Grammy winning Engineer Woody Woodruff, Michael assembled a collection of new standards that range from the album’s first single, “It’s Too Late” and ”You’ve Got a Friend,” both by Carole King;   to a dimensional “Fragile” by Sting.  Joni Mitchell’s “Both Sides Now” is given an expansive, but respectful new spin;  while Michael Frank’s “Tell Me All About It” is a playfully laidback interplay, featuring guest and Rendezvous co-founder Dave Koz, with Brazilian sensibilities.

&gt; A defining characteristic of all of the album’s 11 tracks are unexpected shifts in mood and instrumentation that flow organically in and out of each other.  Paul Simon’s “Still Crazy After All These Years” features romantic strings and sultry sax.  “Nobody Does it Better” by Marvin Hamlisch, is a more restrained and romantic Gospel flavor that builds to a no-holds-barred conclusion.  Randy Waldman’s keyboards, and the All-Star ensemble featuring Vinnie Colauita, Brian Bromberg, Dean Parks, Luis Conte, and a top Los Angeles session orchestra, season each song to perfection. 

&gt; The album also features “A Song for You,” penned by rocker Leon Russell, “She’s Always A Woman”, by Billy Joel and “Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word”, by songwriting greats Elton John and Bernie Taupin.  With his instrumental versatility, Michael also plays clarinet on the intro to “Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word”, an instrument that he studied classically for eight years prior to him picking up the sax at age 15.  

&gt; Leaning strongly toward the pop side of jazz, with classical, Brazilian, Latin, and gospel shadings, Lington plays a distinctive contemporary saxophone.  “It’s the kind of record that inspired me from the very beginning.  The songs on this CD are the core of what has driven me to become a musician,” says Michael.  “I wanted to go back in time, to when music had a strong emotional impact on people and songs really mattered -- but to do it with a new twist.  

&gt; Michael explains, “With this album, I really wanted to focus on the underappreciated, or underexposed standards of tomorrow -- mainly songs from the ’70s that have been rarely covered in a jazz instrumental format.”  He continues, “what I had in mind during the entire process, was to create a classic album, with a timeless feel that is as current today as it is 40  years from now.” 

&gt; Growing up in a suburb of Copenhagen, Denmark, Michael Lington is the grandson of Otto Lington, a jazz pioneer in their tiny country, and bandleader for Shirley Bassey, Josephine Baker and Fats Waller, amongst many others.   As a childhood fan of musicians like Vinnie Colaiuta, Dean Parks and Randy Waldman, Michael would replay his vinyl jazz recordings again and again, reflecting on the memories of his grandfather’s era. 

&gt; Little did Michael know, that someday, his name would be nestled in the notes next to those of his childhood heroes in an album of contemporary classics.  The rich legacy of his grandfather’s jazz connection, his classical training, and a stint of touring in Europe, led him to the U.S. in 1990, and at 21, he began performing with Little Richard , Gary “U.S.” Bonds and Randy Crawford.  He also landed a four year gig touring with singer Bobby Caldwell , joining the list of imminent sax players associated with the singer, including Rendezvous co-founder Dave Koz, Richard Elliot and Boney James. 

&gt; It was through this collaboration, that Michael landed his recording contract, which leads to present, and his new CD, in which there is an organic synergy between Lington, the songs, and arrangements, that lifts Song for You into the realm of the truly unforgettable.  

&gt; Michael believes covering songs that have deeply impacted listeners is far more demanding than recording his own material.  “People feel strongly about these songs.  It’s important for me to keep the integrity of the song, yet make it my own, so I’m not just repeating what’s been done before.  If you improvise too much, you lose your audience, but if you play it straight up and down, it’s not very interesting—it’s a fine line between staying true to the melody, and yet making each song interesting instrumentally.”

&gt; Lington has been a global touring presence for the past several years, and plans to continue with A Song for You.  In between his ongoing performances -- i.e. performing at the Royal Wedding of Denmark’s future king, Crown Prince Frederick -- and recordings, Lington proves to be a giving performer by lending his artistry to the  Mr. Holland’s Opus Foundation, which raises funds for children’s music programs and provides instruments to public schools all over the U.S.  Michael participates in Create Now, where he mentors troubled teens in Los Angeles and Acre’s of Love, a non-profit organization that provides comprehensive services;  and “Forever” homes for abandoned and AIDS children in South Africa.

&gt; The U.S. based, Danish-born Lington loves classic beauty and expression whether it comes in the form of a song, his vintage European automobiles, underwater landscapes, a child’s smile, or open sky viewed from behind the instrument panel of a helicopter. 

&gt; A Song for You is undoubtedly a significant step in Lington’s ever-ascending career, and an invitation for everyone to dream.

Patrice Evra is honing skills in Italy and aims to be a boss in England.

Patrice Evra is learning absorbing much as he can at JuventusPatrice Evra is learning absorbing much as he can at Juventus (Paul Cooper)
PATRICE EVRA was still recovering from the shock of Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement when “The Boss” played a significant part in resculpting Evra’s own future. Their conversation came near the end of the 2012-13 season, when Manchester United won the title by 11 points.

Ferguson: “Patrice, two people are going to be great managers in this team. You and Ryan Giggs.”

Evra: “Come on, boss!”

Ferguson: “Patrice, trust me because you understand football, you know how to talk to people, you’ve got the leadership. Forget tactics and everything; you know how to pass on your passion. You can easily pass on your inspiration, your leadership. Trust me — do your badges.”

Evra, who was about to turn 32, had not considered management until then. Before that season had finished he was coaching academy players. Now in his second year at Juventus, Evra regards his concluding years as an elite-level player as an observation course in Serie A tactics and preparation. “I am like a computer, I’m trying to absorb everything.”

When Ferguson spoke, you listened. The way his captain tells it, there was no point arguing when a halt was called to a quarter-century at Old Trafford. “I remember we talked maybe two weeks before and he said, ‘Patrice, I will be here another five years’,” says Evra, laughing. “I said. ‘Yes, boss. Let’s do it.’ I was so convinced. He was looking younger and younger, amazing. He even told me ‘99%, Cristiano Ronaldo will come’. I was like, ‘Wow, we are ready to bounce back and to even win the Champions League again’.

“After that everyone knows what happened. You know when you are lost and you feel like the world is crumbling? It was a big trauma. I felt lost.”

Ferguson had been working with Ronaldo’s representatives to bring the forward back from Real Madrid, and Ronaldo wanted the move. The decision to retire, he explained to his players, was made after a family bereavement, the death of his wife’s twin sister.

A year later, Evra himself had to face the decision: stay or go. Much has been said about the Frenchman’s transfer to Juventus 59 days after United announced a one-year extension to his contract. The standard narrative is that the left-back was too old; that the inbound Louis van Gaal preferred Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind in his position.

One reason Evra requested our interview was to let United’s supporters know why he left. The delicacy of the departure, and a desire not to offend Juve fans in detailing the pain it caused him, made Evra wait more than a year before speaking. “First of all I didn’t want to hear about any club because my club was Manchester United,” he says. “We have to be clear about that.

“David Moyes had said to me, ‘I really want you to stay because you are my captain’. I explain, ‘But I have got a family problem and it will be difficult for me to stay’. After that I met [executive vice-chairman] Ed Woodward, ‘Patrice, I know your problem, your agent told me about it, but I can’t lose you. You are such an important figure at the club.’”

Evra, whose wife wished to leave England, thanked Woodward and requested some time to think. While he was on holiday United announced that contract extension. His deal included an option for another year, and the club exercised it.

“Juventus had already talked to me. The challenge was so exciting. [Juve coach Antonio] Conte had called me a lot during the World Cup. It was not difficult to go to Juventus, because it is such a big, historic club. But it was difficult to leave Manchester United.

“Ryan Giggs called me and said ‘Come on Patrice, if you want, you can talk with [Louis] Van Gaal’. I say, ‘OK, but I am really upset and let’s see.’ Ed Woodward called me and said again ‘Patrice, I am sorry. But you have to stay, I will give you another two years contract.’ I understood he had the club’s interests at heart. I didn’t know what to do.

“The president of Juventus, Andrea Agnelli, called me and said ‘Look, we didn’t put your contract to the Italian league, you can change your mind, but we really want you here’. And I feel somebody really wants me strongly, with a lot of respect.

“After that I speak with my wife and she was ready to go, so I call Ed Woodward to say, ‘I am sorry, I already gave my word to Juventus, I can’t go back’.”

The hardest moment came when Evra went to say his farewells to a touring United team in their Los Angeles hotel. “It was one of the worst days in my life. Finally I meet Van Gaal. ‘Patrice, nice to meet you, a lot of people talk so well about you. I really want you to stay.’ I say, ‘It’s too late...’ ‘No. I have got a lot of plans for you, for you to play centre-back sometimes. Play 3-5-2.’

“And again I was thinking ‘Oh, my God.’ That’s why I don’t want to blame anybody. The only person who takes the full responsibility why I leave Man United is myself. I am the one to make the choice.”

Evra remembers looking at himself in black-and-white stripes and asking what he was doing. For two months he felt unable to give all of himself to his new team.

Slowly he began to appreciate the benefits of a training regime that demanded more than double the hours he had put in at United, a medical team that resolved a long-term health problem, and an approach to tactical preparation unlike anything he had known in reaching four Champions League finals with Monaco and United.

“I didn’t expect this,” he says. “ I learnt a lot about a way to be more professional — even if I was already a massive professional in Manchester. I was sometimes thinking, ‘You win a lot of trophies for Manchester but you could have done much more if you had known the Italian way to play.’

“I always say the Premier League is like two boxers fighting. The one who is least strong gets tired, he goes down. Here it is like a chess game, and you have to understand every move before you play with your quality, your strength, your skill. That’s the difference.”

Evra’s first season added Serie A and Coppa Italia titles to his 10 major trophies at United, and he was in the Champions League final again in May. In September, Juve went to Manchester City, fell a goal behind, but left as winners. Serie A is poised to displace the Premier League in third place in the Uefa rankings. Is he surprised?

“No. I learn a lot, and I’m a little bit worried about English football. Why? In Europe, being fast, being strong, playing only with your quality, you are going to struggle against teams that prepare. That is where England has to work, it is about tactics. But it is not easy, because the players won’t accept it.

“When Juventus played Manchester City — and it was an extra bonus of course as an ex-Red — I was not worried. Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City, when they buy expensive players a lot of people say, ‘They should win, you see all the wages he got’. But this is not the football.

“When you play against Manchester City, did any player win the Champions League in their squad? Before the game I thought, ‘In Juventus, I’ve got three or four.’ It’s not like being arrogant, but it’s just, ‘I know what I’ve got in my bag, let’s go.’

“Then before the game it’s like going into the restaurant. I say to [Massimiliano] Allegri, the coach, ‘What is on the menu today?’ Because he gives you all the information. Against City, the way we came out from the back, it was really smooth, because we train every day like that.

“When I’ve got the ball I have three solutions, I have to choose the best one. In England sometimes you’ve got the ball and you have to create something with your own skill. But in Italy they don’t leave you time to create. Allegri always says, ‘If this door is closed why go through it? Go to the open door. If that one is closed again, pass the ball back, then you go to the other door.’ That’s their philosophy, and I’m so lucky to get all of this information.”

If his luck holds, one day Evra wishes to pass that information to Premier League players. He already has the master’s seal of approval.

,"First of all, that us not the comment I was commenting on nor was it the content that I was referring to. Secondly, once again you are quite wrong.  Yes, there were some places in Africa where slaves were treated well.  Just like there were some slaves on Europe and North America that were treated well.  But on the whole, slavery in Africa was just as bad and depraved.  So once again, you are making absolutely ludicrous and incorrect statements and claims, in the comment I originally responded to and this last one.
I ask that you look into the western African tribes, specifically in Angola, which were some of the major contributors to the American slave trade, and see how they treated slaves they caught and especially those who they left behind because they weren't worth enslaving.  For the most part, slavery in western Africa was just as brutal as what the West engaged in and many times much worse.  So please do your homework before making ridiculous statements and pretending that you know what you're talking about.

&gt; Mrs May previously told the Commons enforcement agencies needed more powers to do their jobs effectively.

&gt; Writing in the Telegraph previously, former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg warned that Britain would be &amp;quot;Setting a worrying international precedent&amp;quot; if plans for the massive database of people&amp;#039;s internet and phone usage went ahead. The Security Service, along with MI6 and GCHQ, has previously warned MPs that the ability to combat terrorism would be severely hampered without the powers.

&gt; Under the plans, telecoms and internet service providers would be paid to log their customers&amp;#039; emails, internet use and other correspondence so it could be easily searched by security officials.

team 75,"Not exciting may be, except for game 3, but what's meaningful to you may not or is not meaningful to other. I'm sure this world means a lot to Korea especially after the exodus and everyone claiming Korea is not as strong as well as every EU fan on reddit thinks KOO is freelo for Fnatic (literally read from a KOO vs KT post match comment). 

You said the final follows a cliche and nothing changed, everything happened as expected while as the same time claiming you never implied Fnc would have a better chance. Like it's fine if you like EU or Fnc but you discredit the Koo tiger while unable to provide another match up that I wouldn't call unexpected or anti-cliche. Tbh, watching Skt vs any one is anticlimatic, it's just that people want Fnc in the final. Don't believe me, If KT won quarter then win against Fnc in semi, people would still call the final boring as SKT beat KT before. If the only way that bracket could produce an interesting opponent for SKT is if Fnc miraculously pulls 2 wins agaisnt 2 Korean teams out of their ass, then it isn't about the final or the final being boring or anticlimatic at all. It's about Fnc being in the final. 

I think everyone here disrespects the KOO tiger quite a bit. Before and even after semi, it wasn't about Koo vs fnc, it's all about how fnc would have a better chance agaisnt skt or fnc playstyle may be effective against skt.

,"So much /r/badhistory here.

India was the richest it ever was under Muslim rule (richest in the world actually), guess when they became a poor shitshow of a nation? You thought the deaths during the Muslim conquest of India was bad, what do you think happened during the British Raj? Some of the greatest cultural elements of India are Muslim, the Taj Mahal for example. The British squandered the wealth, starved the people, and stole the riches. The Western Roman Empire (with Rome itself) began to fall in the 300s with the advent of the barbarians, and fell in 476 before Islam ever came about. The Eastern Roman Empire fell due to their long, protracted war with the [non Muslim] Persian Empire, then they had to contend with the Seljuk Turks and civil wars. A lot of people contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire, including the Romans. The center of learning of Baghdad occurred during Muslim rule. The Middle East was having it's golden age under Muslim rule while Europe was in the Dark Ages. The Islamic Empire was the civilization that had to contend with the Mongols. If they weren't strong enough to serve as a buffer, Europe would be like China and Russia with a history of Mongolian rule. Imagine a worse version of what the Huns did.

Then take a look at the richest nations now. Most are East Asian, Western, or Arab. Look at Africa, the countries with the highest HDI are Muslim. Sure, not all Muslim African countries are doing great - but the African countries that are doing okay (disregarding the colonial S Africa) are mostly Muslim. The worst war since WWII was the Second Congo War, which was the result of a history of colonialism screwing over sub-Saharan Africa - which is majority Christian by the way.

EDIT: By the way, remember what I said about India. A similar thing was true about the Mali Empire. West Africa was very rich under Muslim rule, guess when they slid into poverty?",politics,0,1,throwinout,1,1446368476,1446363537,t1_cwk6i3l,t5_2cneq,cwk8x4i,t3_3qz4l0,,1447327749,,0,

,"“On this day,” the President shouted from his bullhorn. The bullhorn was once part of a car hood, which had been scrapped for parts generations ago. “On this day, “he repeated, “The 10th of May, In the year 1000 After War, stand here at Plymouth Harbor in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  Today, we send our first ship, the Finder, to seek out Europe, once again!” The crowd cheered in a mighty roar.  “Since the War of All Ends, The Re-United States of the Americas has wondered if it was alone. Well, today, we take that first step toward answering that thousand year long question!”
Those present clapped and hugged one another.  The ship, The Finder, was a ten year plan.  The first two years was spent planning the expedition and spreading word across the country, gathering forces. The following three years was spent gathering supplies and deforesting much of the Pacific Northwest.  The final five years were spent constructing the behemoth.  Finally, in February, 1000 AW, The Finder was completed; the largest naval ship in recorded history.
The President smashed the ceremonial bottle against the ship; below, a tray collected the glass, to recycle them for later use.  The Finder took off with a crew of over ten thousand.  Many questioned the rationale behind the enormous sacrifice and, as some called it, “waste of resources” to find Europe.  Regardless of whether or not Europe still existed, they had to eat.  The ship would need a years’ worth of food for over ten thousand people. Others questioned the authority of this new assembly calling itself a government. They hadn’t taken part of any vote, yet their resources were seized.  All tracking had to be done by hand and on paper, once again, making it relatively easy for resources to go missing and land in officer’s and mayor’s houses.  A year of exposed corruption delayed the production of the ship.  However, the President insisted that to stop now would truly be a waste.  Those responsible were hanged in Public Square under direct order from the President himself.
The ship sailed into the dense glowing fog, sealing all hatches.  It would be at least a year before anyone saw them again.
On a chilly day in June, the people of San Diego, Califexico awoke to a strange roaring.  Citizens and freemen gathered at the shores. People readied their rifles while freemen manned the canons at the beaches, fearing another whale attack.  At first, they started as specks in the sky.  Then, as they got closer, they appeared to be giant birds, flying in a small formation. Yet, as the strange machines got closer still, others recognized them as an ancient technology. Airplanes.

,"Well F1 only uses one engine formula, but still every manufacturer has to build their own version of a 1.6 V6 turbo. But otherwise aero and monocoque design regs are very restricted, I hope the new regs for 2017 actually shake things up (talking about wider tires, low-downforce, more horsepower/torque etc.). But sure I see why you care more for the ""run what ya bring"" style of racing. I think if we're talking about modern high-profile racing fitting this attitude the best way, then I think World RallyCross, the British Touring Car Championsip and the World Endurance Championship (the same cars that also run the Le Mans 24h)  would be more to your liking, although the ladder is very time consuming to understand and watch and probably is the main reason why it isn't more popular than F1 or Nascar (although F1 is a more direct target to them), because other than that it's far superior in all aspects. These three series are pretty open with a lot of different engine configs, cars with different shapes and sizes racing against each other.

,"This story made me quite sad. I'm English from London not South African nor have I ever been there but my dad (also English/Northern Irish) and his parents and siblings emigrated to South Africa in 1979 and left in 1990. They lived in Joburg - Houghton and he said it was a dream growing up. Safety, family, great weather, he told me how he and his mates would go out to discos in Hillbrow and Yeovil and all other kinds of things. I know people see their youth with rose coloured lenses but still he smiles every time he talks about it.


They left when my grandad lost his job and around the time that the whole situation was heating up and there was a real possibility of civil war between Afrikaners, the ANC, the Inkathas, a coup against de Klerk was possible etc. In 2011 my dad went back because he old schoolmate had a tragic accident he went to attend the funeral. He was horrified at the state of the place. The street where him and his brothers used to play footie into the night was all walled up, barbed wire, big emblems from security companies, nobody out and completely lifeless. Every shop he remembered was gone, every block of flats ruined and filled with - what looked like to him - squatters. He drove into the centre to see his old stomping grounds and was genuinely afraid that his car was going to get hijacked. The squalor was unbearable for him, when he called me was the first I've ever heard him cry tbh.


What me and him spoke about is that the democratic transition was done in a disorganised fashion, and you had a situation where you've a country built with a western-like NW European type lifestyle in mind where 90% of the country doesn't share that culture or values and was in desperate poverty so when the group areas act went away people from the townships flooded into the cities and there was a clash and general degeneration of lifestyle. This hurts the blacks because now they've just traded their rural slum for an urban slum and it hurts the whites because their areas became irrevocably changed at such a fast pace that they were no longer comfortable and sometimes even hostile for them so they left.


I know Zim is quite a poor country and I don't know how you're holding up but I wanted to share that my dad's sister - who was 2 when they emigrated and thus raised a South African - emigrated from here in Greater London, UK to a small-ish coastal city in Queensland Australia and she says that is where she feels truly at home. The landscape, weather and feel of the place are like South Africa but without the negatives and in addition there is a humongous population of Saffa and Rhodie expatriates there, so much so that South African foodstuffs are sold in the market and she hears people speaking Afrikaans on a daily basis and there is even an NG Kerk near her. Just food for thought if you ever want to change your situation but are afraid of the unfamiliar.

Edit: Also interesting how you mentioned Europe.

The British census of 1871 reported 58,255 Muslims in Akyab District. By 1911, the Muslim population had increased to 178,647.[46] The waves of migration were primarily due to the requirement of cheap labour from British India to work in the paddy fields. Immigrants from Bengal, mainly from the Chittagong region, ""moved en masse into western townships of Arakan"". To be sure, Indian immigration to Burma was a nationwide phenomenon, not just restricted to Arakan.[47]

Historian Thant Myint-U writes: ""At the beginning of the 20th century, Indians were arriving in Burma at the rate of no less than a quarter million per year. The numbers rose steadily until the peak year of 1927, immigration reached 480,000 people, with Rangoon exceeding New York City as the greatest immigration port in the world. This was out of a total population of only 13 million; it was equivalent to the United Kingdom today taking 2 million people a year."" By then, in most of the largest cities in Burma, Yangon, Sittwe, Pathein and Mawlamyine, the Indian immigrants formed a majority of the population. The Burmese under the British rule felt helpless, and reacted with a ""racism that combined feelings of superiority and fear.""",worldnews,0,2,Windreon,2,1446368485,1446368299,t1_cwk9tnf,t5_2qh13,cwk9x3e,t3_3r1882,,1447328221,,0,

,"Ground Zero: The group's technician shows signs of infection in the post-check reports. The doctors prescribe him to a set of standard antibodies for the inane symptoms, but it quickly begins developing, eating away at him without his knowledge.

Month 1: the technician is dead and the body is home to flies, who contract the virus. The flies proceed to sit on food, other animals and people, which results in a slow spread of a future epidemic.


Month 2: the first few animals detected with strange signs of disease and rabid disposition are put down. the media downplays it as a random rabies outbreak that was contained.


Month 3: the first humans with the virus are found. Repeated tests of early victims only shows signs of the generic flu, but it quickly matures within its host and causes a violent reaction. 

Month 4: Week 5, the virus fully matures within all existing hosts and is rapidly expanding. All efforts to understand what the virus is fail, and efforts to develop prototype antibodies are rapidly falling apart. Approximately 100,000 people are dead and several times more infected.

Month 5: All known infected areas are quarantined in hopes to contain the outbreak, and all regions with report of infection have immediately had their transport and freight networks cancelled until further notice. However, it is already too late.

Month 6: Most countries start showing reports of infected people. Major transport and trade networks are cancelled for fear of further spreading the network. Death toll rises to 300 million worldwide.

Month 7: Trade collapse has resulted in world economy collapsing. Desperate to salvage what's left of the world, the UN issues orders to burn all infected zones and to kill any infected person on sight. Martial law is enacted in every country.

Month 8: Death toll rises to 3.7 billion as most major fauna are extinct. Most of the US has been wiped out and Europe suffers a similar fate, with a large section of the continent completely void of any signs of animal or human life. Asia suffers significantly as smaller regions like Indonesia and Korea have been reported to have been wiped out, with Japan, India and Chine reporting massive casualties.

Month 9: Virus begin showing signs of receding as the Summer heat sets in in most countries.

,"Prepare for a long explanation...

Eyja - Ey as in ""Hey"" but with no ""H"". Ja, as in how you would pronounce ""Ya""

Fjalla - Fja is pronounced something like ""Cha"" in Char (charred, etc.), but with the ch sound replaced by an ""F"". So something along the lines of ""Fyah"". Now for the ""lla"" part of the word: The double ""l"" sound is pronounced like ""(d)l""... Like the word ""Kettle"", but only the ""ttle"" part of it (Where the ""e"" is rather silent, ofcourse). However, it's a bit softer/more swallowed than ""ttle"", hence the ""(d)l"" I mentioned earlier. Then just add an ""A"" sound pronounced like the first ""A"" in ""America"". So something along the lines of ""Fyah'ttl-ah"".

Jökull - The ""Ö"" is pronounced like the ""eu"" of the French word ""bleu"". The ""J"" here sounds the same as the ""J"" in ""Eyja"", so it sounds like ""Yeu*-"" (don't forget the specific ""eu"" pronunciation. That one is important!). The ""kull part of ""Jökull"": ""Ku"" like the ""Cu"" in the word ""Cumbersome"". The ""ll"" is pronounced like the ""ll"" in ""Fjall"", so ""ttle"". Then, we have ""Yeu*-cu'ttl""

And for the whole name (Which consists of those three words): 

Eya Fyah'ttl-ah Yeu*-cu'ttl.

(Island-Mountain-Glacier)

The main thing to remember about these types of words in Icelandic is that they're really just multiple compound words smushed together. Very similar to German. Icelandic is by no means defined by these long-ass and difficult-to-pronounce words, so getting everyone to pronounce it is like having someone pronouncing ""Pneumonia"" without speaking a lick of English. So hopefully this will help you shove the joke back down the throats of obnoxious Icelanders by pronouncing it well! :)

&gt; The numbers are growing - if 50% of my packets are lost before it even left Europe, then 100% of them cannot arrive at destination in Boston, the same goes for latency - if it takes 50 ms to go through first five waypoints, it cannot reach the 6th in 40 ms. In the image you see some minor fluctuations which contradicts this rule - they are caused when some router on the way decides not to reply to test packet, or it takes him longer to reply then the packet spends on the way - this is not a problem for us, just consider it random subspace fluctuation and focus on big picture.  


Let me rephrase. **Packet loss or high return times are not indicative of a problem unless they continue through the route.** This is because in order to reach a certain router packets have to travel through the entire route before it, so logically if one router shows high ping and packet loss the rest of the route should reflect it.  

These anomalies appear, because of how routers handle the packets used for ""ping"" or ""tracert"". Basically routers are very efficient at routing packages, but they are not designed to respond themselves. Every time you ""ping"" (ICMP echo) or ""tracert"" (ICMP exceed) the router itself has to respond, which is handled in the control plane of the router for most models. Since this isn't supposed to be the main function it's relatively low on resources. So in order to protect the other functions that are happening in the control plane responding to your ping request is at the very bottom of its priority list. Pretty much all routers also implement rate-limiting, which limits the amount of ping requests it will answer. Some even drop them completely. (Depending on the settings a bunch of angry nerds tracerouting may already be enough to run into the rate-limiting.) Both of these things may cause additional latency or packet loss to show up, which is why you ignore isolated timeouts or ""problem"" routers in a traceroute.  

There are other fun things that can mess with your traceroute, like asymmetric routes or load balancing. So please be aware that traceroute is a great diagnostic tool, but you have to be very aware of its shortcomings.  

If you want to know more [here](http://cluepon.net/ras/traceroute.pdf) is a very exhaustive guide on how to use traceroute.

,"Ever since the global financial crisis, several large economies - most notably the USA engaged in quantitative easing or stimulus. Most of this money padded the bank's reserves - who can lend out more (read up fractional lending) plus lowering interest rates in an attempt to boost the economy. Since the financial systems in Europe, the Anglosphere and places like HK, Singapore etc are all extremely similar and interconnected - there's this worldwide phenomenon of cheap credit flooding everywhere. In layman's terms there's quite literally nowhere left to invest it that makes financial sense when considering returns - bonds are almost worthless, stocks are expensive considering average dividends etc. There was also a fear back then that the financial system was shaky, so all of this contributed to investing in property as they can own it outright in perpetuity (freehold) no matter what happens to the economy - there's a 99.99% chance the rule of law will still be there, land is scarce, the population will always grow etc. This made property more expensive than traditional economic fundamentals would suggest (&gt;5x average income) but because so many people did it at the same time, it led to a speculative bubble now that pushes house prices way into the stratosphere - up to 40x average wage. 

Think London is expensive? Try Singapore, Hong Kong or Beijing where an ok 1000 square foot 2 bed flat would cost you £800k minimum. A modest house in Zurich, Vancouver and Sydney is about £1.2 million - even though they make a lot more than Londoners, it's more unaffordable to them. Cheaper cities like SF, NYC are still £650k for a 2 bed flat. My point here is not that London is good value for money, but it's just to show how much of an impact the QE and speculation had on prices across the globe.

tl;dr - flood of cheap credit, people tried to preserve wealth by owning property, it made property more attractive and expensive, which led to a speculative bubble, took advantage of this cheap credit.

So Canadian dollars; 


.

**8""**

KWTelescope has the xt8 comparably cheap but over budget http://kwtelescope.com/orion-skyquest-xt8-classic-dobsonian-telescope.html (but costs as much as the smaller 6"").

.


**~~127eq~~**The drop-out-of-the-hobby-o-scope

Please don't buy the bird-jones 127eq or any other of these. They just cause more trouble and the frustration can lead you right out of this nice hobby :-(

.

**102az**

For deep-sky (nebulae, galaxies) aperture is key. 4"" already shows a bit but of course not as much as 5, 6 or even 8"". Did you check out the links on what to expect visually? :-)



The Astromaster 102az is not bad and I would probably recommend it over the 127eq (again, please don't buy, there are threads such as [""I really hate my bird-jones and can't collimate it""](http://www.cloudynights.com/topic/479897-i-really-hate-my-bird-jones-and-cant-collimate-it-help/) for a reason).


**BUT** for the price of the 102az you can get a Skywatcher Heritage 130p AND a good additional eyepiece. Or a amazing used telescope (See further down).

 The 5"" dobsonian will even make a nice secondary travel telescope after you buy a larger one in the future.

Or get the c90 as you still find use for it if you don't stay with the hobby  :-) Sadly it's more expensive over there (and here in Europe as well). [Strangely it's almost cheaper to get this](http://quarkyscience.ca/shop/virtuoso-mak90-90mm-3-5-maksutov-cassegrain-telescope/) than the telescope (cad$275) + tripod.



.

**Binoculars as entry level instrument**

Actually even binoculars will show you a bunch of galaxies and nebulae. Do you own some?

Even if not, they can be a great addition to view objects with larger apparent size. Their large field of view makes it easier to orient yourself, even in combination with a telescope. I found them very useful when trying to locate things with my telescope. Even cheap ones (Celestron Cometron 7x50 Binoculars $41cad) can be nice to have, but in the low budget range there's a lot of trash as well. Also, over 10x is not easy to hold free-handed when observing DSO, and depending on the light pollution you might choose some others with a smaller exit pupil (e.g. 6x30 or 10x50).


**The most important tool**

Make sure to grab a copy of ""Turn left at Orion"". Sure, there are Apps (e.g. Night sky tools) and great software such as http://Stellarium.org, but it will show you what to expect visually, what's worthwhile observing, how to observe, where to find it etc.

.

**Department store telescopes**

""Department store telescopes are a common term for garbage telescopes in astronomy forums.

There's a reason why no one recommends buying telescopes at *mart or *co.  The people responsible for the products they stock typically have no clue about telescopes and pick products that look like the stereotypic telescope and seem to have a good value/price. 

Pick a astronomy shop nearby or one with good on-line return policy if you really worry. 


.

**Optics over mount?**

In my personal opinion, I would rather buy the Celestron 114/900 (""real"" focal length) for CDN$ 179.99 (or a fragment, used!) before I'd get the bird-jones. The EQ1 is horrible for larger telescopes, but at leas the telescope is not, and one can still build a better mount for it. 

.

**Options not available or more expensive in Canada** :,-(

Strangely over there the SkyScanner 100 and similar cost as much as the Heritage 130p (while in the US they cost &lt;$100 &amp; $199).

The Heritage costs cad$267 over there, the XT4.5 $318 (too close to the 8"" dobsonian IMO, weird! :-))

Also the c90 costs much more almost anywhere outside the US.



.


**Used**

Sure, lots of garbage, but you can frequently get telescopes for half their retail price. 


Used deals I spotted on the fly:

- SW 150/750 for cad$200:

 - http://montreal.craigslist.ca/tag/5251767647.html

 - Not perfect, but the mount does not suck (nEQ3 iirc) and 6"" shows quite a bit! The F/5 aperture ratio has a few down-sides but it'll make a great telescope anyway, beating all those 4"".

 - That's a good deal!

- 114/500

 - Only $35. That's what I would spend for any of the bird jones or very short focal length telescopes. Not $200+ new. They won't be good. But hey, $35.

 - http://maine.craigslist.org/for/5251744562.html


- 130/910 on EQ2

 - $200. Not as good as a deal as the first, but hey, there are worse telescope. The stability is borderline cringeworthy 

 - http://maine.craigslist.org/ele/5231259303.html



- 4"" Goto Maksutov

 - $250. http://maine.craigslist.org/for/5226615214.html

 - Not bad, but the 150/750 will beat it in any regard. 

 - Computerized/GoTo is a nice gadget, but finding objects manually is not hard either. Especially those worthwhile observing in a 4"". ""Turn left at Orion"" is easier to read than the GoTo handbook :-) And set-up for manual telescopes is shorter, too, of course. Also the cheaper GoTo mounts may not be pushed by hand, so batteries/power supply always required, if you're out of power, pack up &amp; go home.


If you search CL you will find a lot of similar offers; Right now  but further away there are 8"" dobsonians for $200-$300, not unusual, e.g. http://burlington.craigslist.org/ele/5244473149.html


.

Keep in mind the resale value of a decent starter telescope is much better too. E.g. if you buy one at a very good price, you can resell it easily. Something  like the Powerseeker bird-jones sell up to $300 in-store, but sell for as low as $30-$50 used regularly. For a reason.  Of course they will show more than the naked eye, but as there are alternatives for the same price, avoid.

,"It is often three things:

- Esperanto itself. It is really something different. The vocabulary is European, but the agglutination system is very Asian (I am quoting Claude Piron). Esperanto was made to be easy, and discovering how Zamenhof did to make it as easy as possible is fascinating.

- It makes your present and future languages stronger. The word in the Esperanto vocabulary is often the most common word in European languages. It is a big boost if you plan to learn other European languages. There are a limited number of vocabulary roots to learn, on which you can add affixes to express almost anything. Exemple: san/ is the root for health. san-a = healthy. san-e = healthy-ly. san-o = the health. mal-san-o = a sickness. mal-san-ul-o = a sick person. mal-san-ul-ej-o = a place for sick people = a hospital. This system forces you to understand the essence of what you are saying. There are a lot of words in French and English I did not understand before reading the Esperanto constructed version.

- The ability to quickly speak fluently with people from all other the world. I caught some people who just finished their Esperanto tree in DiscordApp and GoSpeaky. They are all amazed by how much they can express.

My favorite thing is this quote from Wikipedia: The Institute of Cybernetic Pedagogy at Paderborn (Germany) has compared the length of study time it takes natively French-speaking high-school students to obtain comparable 'standard' levels in Esperanto, English, German, and Italian.[61] The results were:
**2000 hours studying German = 1500 hours studying English = 1000 hours studying Italian (or any other Romance language) = 150 hours studying Esperanto.**
It is the level for the French Baccalauréat. Something we get when we are around 16/17/18 years old.

-""Kritik der Politischen Ökonomie"" (especially Das Kapital) by Karl Marx (also ""Das Kommunistische Manifest"" and ""Der Bürgerkrieg in Frankreich"")     
-""Mythos Sozialismus – Von den Schwierigkeiten der Entmythologisierung einer Ideologie"" by Klaus Motschmann  
-""Was ist Sozialismus"" by Michael Brie / Christoph Spehr   
-""Für eine bessere Gesellschaft. Studien zu Sozialismus und Sozialdemokratie."" by Iring Fetscher     
-""A History of Socialist Thought."" by S. Mukherjee / S. Ranaswamy   

Sorry for a lack of English sources, but - quite frankly - there simply are very few good English sources. There should be English translations of those sources available.

Educating yourself about socialist parties in Europe might help you, too, e.g. the SPD in Germany:

They aren't the overall [second biggest political force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_European_Socialists) in Europe (after the center right EPP) without reason.

,"Wow...This is a massive coincidence. I'm in the EXACT same situation as you are. I'm from America, and I moved to Germany a few months ago. For me it is the same thing; new country, new city, new language, new culture, new everything. My problem here is that I have absolutely any contact with people my age. I'm 19, and I live with a guest family here in Germany, the parents of which are in almost 50, and the children are between 10 and 13. I go to a language school in the city here, and I can't make a personal connection with any of the other students because they're a little older than me and they come from very different countries than me. I've tried making friends with the other students, the Bulgarians, the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, the Syrians, but none of them seem to want to be friends with me, the only American. My life consists of going to school in the morning, coming home in the afternoon, and sitting alone in my room for the rest of the day. It's extremely depressing to think that I chose this life in Germany instead of staying with my friends in America. It's been a dream of mine to study here in Europe and make my life here, but due to the distance from my home it will naturally make relations with my family and with my old friends very weak and non-intimate. It hurts like hell for me too to spend all my time alone and barely talk to anyone, but I have no one to talk to! As a person with Asperger's making new friends is already hard. Even if I had many people to choose, making friends would be hard. But now I have the additional challenge of finding people. It hurts me too when I see over social media how much fun my friends are having together while I'm on the other side of the world completely alone. I wish I had advice for you, but I just wanted to tell you that there are people like me who understand what the pain is like.

There is historical consensus that the holocaust did happen and that millions of Jews died. Please don't deny it. 

&gt; **dolts like you always bring up the Jews that allegedly perished during the war but neglect to mention the 60 million Gentiles**

I mentioned the holocaust because that's what was mentioned in the parent comment. 

Yes, millions of all kinds of people were killed in the world wars. That's just one more reason for not idealizing the past. Europe was constantly at war, and millions of people died.

The relative peace on the European continent right now is another reason to appreciate the time we live in right now.

Yes sure, it's debatable whether or not we're doing better now than in the 50's and 60's (I believe we are), and it may even differ from country to country.

And you're also right about it being caused by a post-war boom, this caused the high standards of living in the 50-60's much more than it does now.

,"Just be really *really* careful with adult toys. You can't just glance at the page and some reviews and determine that the toy is safe, especially given the whole thing with how amazon bins items. Nobody outside of someone with a lab will be able to test a toy for harmful chemicals. There are an incredible amount of toys with horrible chemicals in them because they are entirely unregulated. /r/sextoys has [a guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SexToys/comments/20d59r/the_rsextoys_guide_for_sex_toy_shopping_tips/) with tons of information about toy safety that you should read through. [One of the articles](http://dangerouslilly.com/2014/11/sex-toys-from-amazon-gamble/) in particular talks specifically about amazon. You should read the entire thing, if nothing else.

One of the most common toxic chemicals found in sex toys are phthalates. They have a wide range of terrible side effects, mainly related to developmental and reproductive issues including things like low sperm count and demasculization. They are also very porous, which means they will absorb bacteria, mildew, fungus, etc. and will never be able to be fully sterilized. One particular thing to note is that jelly and ""cyberskin"" toys almost always have phthalates in them, though that doesn't mean silicone toys don't either.

There's plenty of other much, much worse chemicals found in sex toys. One of the articles mentions a study of 16 randomly chosen toys where one had timethytin chloride which is can have irreversible neurotoxin effects, 5 had phenol and 3 had carbon disulphide which can both be harmful to the central nervous system, 14 had toluene, and one had cadmium levels so high that the EU would have required the toy to have a radioactive sticker.

Also, don't just trust that anything claiming to be ""100% silicone"" or ""phthalate free"" is actually that. Since there is no regulation on them (and they're probably mostly made in china anyway), there's nothing stopping anyone from lying about whats actually in the toy.",ABDL,0,3,ae6b9,3,1446385231,1446378605,t1_cwkbcxb,t5_2r8xk,cwkbyl5,t3_3r0str,,1447329183,,0,

 points,"&gt;history isn't applicable in the job market and thus shouldn't have as much emphasis placed on it

Again, as I mentioned earlier, most things someone studies in high school or middle school aren't going to directly help them in the job market, even if it is a subject like math or science. The goal of K-12 education is to set up a solid foundation that can be built on with more complex concepts in college, and to teach kids good study skills and critical thinking ability. History makes kids analyze facts and think about how they connect together, a critical skill in the workplace; do you think knowing how two events tie together and analyzing why is more or less important than 9th grade geometry or knowing where Israel is on a map?

&gt;There are other equally as effective and arguably more effective methods and perspective to teach us the ideas we've learned throughout time. It's doesn't do a good job of teaching us Geography/Economics/Sociology/Government as classes in those specific subjects would.

I agree that history isn't a substitute for an entire economics course, or an entire geography course, but it does give a decent starting point for all those subjects. It's impossible to study the industrial revolution without understanding Adam Smith's *On Wealth of Nations*, and later knowledge of Karl Marx and the differences between socialism, capitalism, and communism are essential to understanding of 1900s Europe. Am I going to leave history class reading to go to business school because I understand economics so well? Probably not, but it gives me a decent basic understanding of the topic. The same goes for geography: the topic of geography will obviously be thrown around a little bit, because of course it is important to know that the reason Napoleon wasn't able to invade Britain is because Britain was an island, and he didn't have a strong enough navy to get there. I might not know which Scandinavian country is where, but I do know the general vicinity where every country is.

After leaving high school with a basic understanding of all these concepts like geography, economics, sociology, government, etc, I can go to college and major in one that may be more beneficial in the job market. It would be very hard to teach a 7th grade kid advanced economics, but it is possible to teach them the basic ideas of socialism vs capitalism in regards to the cold war, and, if the kid enjoys that, they could choose to major in it in college.

,"Ok, I was thinking of one pot cooking for simplicity and ease of cleanup where possible. Yes browning in a skillet and using canned beans does speed things up considerably.

Yes, getting used to Indian foods can leave some habitual European or Western approaches to food seeming bland in comparison. But there's still a bunch of traditional ingredients to try out. Bay leaves are very essential for many good lentil soups, I've found they lend a great fragrance, also you can use a whole clove or two in the soup French style, and in a similar vein look at the herbs of bouquet garni to fill out the flavor of a soup. Or use chopped tomatoes for their flavor enhancing qualities in a brown or green lentil stew. Don't shy away from garlic either if you like it.

Consider too that the fake sausages are also probably a source of spices and umami flavors from soy or soy flavorings and then some kind of fat and you can add all of those separately to make a good soup. As westerners we may still have the cultural tradition influencing us where meat had most of the expensive spices, because it was rotting and needed all the help it could get, but we can break out of that routine further and just use those seasonings directly like sage, fennel, caraway or coriander. Then add a vegetable bullion cube, and a good vegetable oil and it could come together. And as you've discovered, carrots compliment lentils well. Sweet potatoes or roasted squashes or roasted sweet potatoes would be other root vegetables to try combining with lentils.

Obviously all of these strong flavors at once could be a mess, so pick out a few of your favorites. Maybe try replicating or getting close to your sausage carrot onion soup with spices, or try a lentil tomato onion carrot garlic one. Italian seasonings like bay leaves, oregano and rosemary or thyme could work there and of course olive oil, or try French lentils with a French herb blend. Especially if you're using a Crockpot it's best to add the tomatoes towards the end of cooking after the legumes have already softened and so more tomato flavor is preserved instead of being stewed down to almost nothing. You can try adding some wine if you use it or some good wine vinegar for extra flavors at the end too, but be aware, I don't think the slow cooker would evaporate most of the alcohol quickly if too much wine was added. With just a little luck you'll be running out of bread to dip in a delicious soup soon. I'd really like some soup for lunch now. Hope that helps.

Oh and if you want some extra kitchen projects that will also impress future guests, you can try making your own bread, if you're able to pull some resting dough out of the refrigerator and make something like focaccia or even just fresh dough dinner rolls go over well if you're far along with the main, and you could also try growing some of your own herbs in the garden or in window containers in the the winter for the freshest flavors.",vegetarian,0,2,brickandtree,2,False,1446379909,t1_cwk8x8v,t5_2qm7x,cwkc9fr,t3_3qyfyw, vegetarian 20+ years,1447329325,,0,

SAF,"&gt; Dortmund's Manager can get them playing the best football in Europe in 3 months

Yes, following a huge amount of ground work laid by Klopp. Their styles are similar which is why he was brought in. It was an *evolution* of Klopps system.

Don't underestimate what we are doing here. In two years we have had a complete overhaul of our system. That is no small feat to pull off.

Fergie (fast, counter, width) to Moyes (don't even ask!) to LVG (slow build up, possessional) is huge. LVG has *revolutionised* our system. And it takes time.

If were smart we bring in someone who can do the same as what we've seen at Dortmund: someone like Pep (fingers crossed) we can fine tune the system based on foundation laid by LVG.

**edit: sp**

Just to add, its a great shame that we didn't get Klopp after Fergie. In terms of progression he made the most sense as he is a sort of combination of counter *a la* Fergie, with more of an emphasis on pressing. The transition wouldn't have been half as difficult as what we've seen.

The first Obama administration even killed a deal after Iran had said yes, pissing off Turkey and Brazil (who negotiated the deal on behalf of the US) that they published a letter showing Obama's approval of the same deal terms just a week earlier http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_brazil-reveals-obama-letter-in-spat-over-iran-nuclear-deal_211443.html

http://garysick.tumblr.com/post/611735702/giving-the-finger-to-iran-and-turkey-and

The US instead insisted on using the nuclear threat issue as a pretext for policy of imposing regime-change

Even IAEA Director ELbaradei noted this;

&gt;I have seen the Iranians ready to accept putting a cap on their enrichment [program] in terms of tens of centrifuges, and then in terms of hundreds of centrifuges. But nobody even tried to engage them on these offers. http://www.newsweek.com/elbaradei-iranians-are-not-fanatics-80021

But instead ...

&gt;“They weren’t interested in a compromise with the government in Tehran, but regime change – by any means necessary, http://news.antiwar.com/2011/04/20/elbaradei-us-europe-werent-interested-in-compromise-with-iran/

In the end, all this refusal to deal with Iran and to instead exaggerate the ""Iranian nuclear threat"" as a pretext accomplished, was to allow Iran to further expand its nuclear program and cause a nationalist backlash in Iran that rallied the Iranian people in favor of their nuclear program http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR910.html


SO

&gt;""For most of the past twenty years, Washington demanded that Iran end its nuclear program but declined to speak with it. By the time American diplomats finally did sit down with the Iranians, their program had expanded and advanced. Despite some rollback, we ended up accepting Iranian nuclear capabilities much beyond what they had earlier offered...In 2005, Iran offered a deal. We rejected it, refused to talk to Iran directly, and doubled down on sanctions. Ten years later, **we settled for much less than what was originally offered.**""

,"&gt;I'm always very skeptical about theories like this.

&gt;It's simpler to assume that they're merely trends, and don't encode any social commentary or significance at all.  Were afros popular in the 70s because they represented the various social entanglements black people were in, becoming more accepted in white society in the aftermath of the civil rights era while still trying to remain a distinct culture? Or was it just a popular hairstyle?

You really think it's a coincidence that  an extremely distinctive and impractical hairstyle became popular and associated with the black community at a time when racial integration and cultural identity were the hot topics? 

&gt;Creatures were popular in the 50s because people back then were creeped out by creatures, and science fiction was just taking off.  Slashers were popular in the 80s because a few really good slasher movies came out, and that started a trend.  etc.

That isn't under discussion. But the deeper question is... Why are we creeped out by slashers/creatures/ghosts and not, say fairies or satyrs, or aliens?

Fears have roots. From the dawn of time, mankind has created legends and stories based on what scared them. It's what we do. Fairy tales like Red Riding Hood were originally horror stories based on the fears of medieval and early modern European people. They creeped them out 800 years ago, but now seem silly and quaint to us.

And I think it's fascinating that, as times and cultural attitudes change, so do our fears.

TEXT,"Bisher noch nie so einen Haufen Kot hier gelesen. 

&gt;Es wird wirklich lustig werden hier, wenn Leute wie du kontinuieren den Ton vorzugeben

Ich? Ich gebe gar nichts vor. Der Artikel ist und bleibt schlecht geschrieben. Wenn du nicht drauf klar kommst, dann heul doch in Leserbriefen indem du die jeweiligen Leitmedien-Redaktion, statt mich anzumachen, dass du und die dummen 50% sich nicht repräsentiert fühlen. Dann sollen die Leute wie du ruhig die Preußische Allgemeine Zeitung lesen, wenn das ""der Allgemeinheit"" entspricht. Was soll denn das ""buhuuu"" Geflenne? Kannst wie zig andere da draußen frei wählen, die PAZ oder Junge Freiheit würde sich freuen. Musst hier aber nicht flennen, wenn ARD/ZDF nicht exakt polemisch in die Kerbe holzen und hier andere Menschen mehrheitlich vorzufinden sind, als der Durchschnitt auf der Straße: Jung, männlich, gebildet, single und technikaffin.

&gt;50%+ der Bevölkerung der Meinung ist ihr Standpunkt und ihre Probleme werden in den Medien nicht repräsentiert

Da bin ich ja froh, dass die Masse nicht zu Volksentscheide in der Lage ist und Kernkompetenzen mittels Wahlen abgegeben werden. Dir steht es ja frei in die Schweiz oder Nordkorea abzuwandern, wenn du geschlossene Grenzen haben willst.

Und wenn Die Welt, FAZ, Stern, FOCUS und BILD und konservative Konsorten nicht des Michels Agenda vertreten ""Die müssen raus!"" und poltern sind Leitmedien wie SPON, taz, oder Zeit dran Schuld. Köstlich. Die Kontigente der Länder und Kommunen sind keine Endlose Ressource und das weiß jeder Realpolitiker. Auch die Regierung.

&gt;In Ungarn ist Orban an der Macht, in Polen ist die Rechtskonservative PiS an die Macht gekommen, was Tumblr schwer zu schlucken gegeben hat: http://i.imgur.com/yFjX27b.png 

Was hat das jetzt überhaupt mit meinem Beitrag und mit Deutschland zu tun?

&gt;In den Niederlanden und der Schweiz gab es einen Rechtsruck mit SVP und PVV und in Schweden tun die Politiker das seit Jahren was die Deutschen Politiker Heute versuchen: die Augen zu schließen, von Prinzipien zu reden und Hoffen dass alles besser wird während das Land weiter in Problemen versinkt und die ""Sweden Democrats"" immer mehr an Wählern mit sich nehmen. In Frankreich gibt es die Front National und Marie Le Pen die auch populärer werden etc.

Bravo, du kannst anscheinend den Paradigmenwechsel der letzten 20 Jahre nicht in Kontext setzen und siehst dich nur in deinem Reflex bestätigt und sprichst Rechtspopulisten eine Daseinsberechtigung zu.


&gt;Entweder man packt diese Themen und Probleme sachlich und unverblendet an

Tue ich doch und kritisiere den Artikel, dass der anhand der Qualität keinen CvD einer großen Redaktion passieren würde, aber im Netz und vor allem in einem Sub wie /europe von Rechten als Beweis und argumentativer Kinnhaken abgefeiert wird. 

Du scheinst ja SVP, Le Pen und Konsorten für legitime Alternativen zu halten, sprichst Regierung als auch der Opposition Traumtänzerei zu und hältst mir hier vor ein indirekt ein realitätsferner Grüner oder Bilderbuch Linker zu sein, der den ""Ton angibt"". Was dem 68er oder beleidigten Türken die Nazikeule ist, ist bei solchen schwarz-weiß denkenden Leuten wie dir absolut keinen Deut besser und erinnert an PEGIDA Mitläufer.

,"People don't care about refugees. You can see this when modern era authoritarian figures like Orban are so loved on this sub because they sprout some populistic medieval sounding anti-immigration bullshit every other week.

It's kind of ironic because not long ago on this sub especially, the left wing noise was heavily criticized for being extreme in the discussions on immigration, too PC you heard said often. Which to some degree I could agree with.

But if you look now, it's the exact opposite. The only thing that happens is complaints, editorialized articles from iffy sources talking about Europe's demise and shitting on any country or politician that doesn't take a clear stance against refugees.

 Meanwhile support is there for whatever political figure can take the most extreme stance against immigration. These people are considered brave, I didn't know populism was considered brave these days. Viktor Orban can afford to say all this shit, Because all he does is watch refugees cross his borders in and out again into western Europe.

,"&gt;From my own experience, I have been paid 9650 kr. / month for doing 160 hours of work per month as a programmer after finishing my Bachelor degree in ICT in Denmark. I have been a member of IDA union and their answer to my inquiry about social dumping was simply ""Sorry, we can't help you"".

So, i can only imagine you weren't actually stably employed for those 160 hours of work with a decent contract. 

My ex-girlfriend was a programmer and routinely didn't receive just about *any* pay for massive amounts of work. Both in Denmark and abroad. As i'm sure you know, when you work as a programmer or any kind of webdesigner and so on, it can be very hard to monetize your work and not be exploited. After all there must be some reason that she and all her former classmates share memes of ""Fuck you, pay me"" as the needed mantra for any employer interaction.

 I can't know for sure what kind of work you are talking about here, but the entire industry has this problem completely unrelated to country borders. Employers take advantage of the work because people are still doing the work for free. Before i decided i wanted to get into medicine, i used to fumble with xhtml, css, etc (15+ years ago) and basically 90% of the people doing this did it for fun/as an interest. This is hugely different from all other work sectors and it is not special to Denmark. 

Let me quote the article you yourself linked:

&gt;""Når man læser tallene over udenlandske lønninger i Danmark, skal man tage det forbehold, at man ikke præcist ved, hvor lang tid personerne har arbejdet i landet, og dermed ved man ikke præcist, om den lave månedsløn afspejler eksempelvis to uger eller en måneds arbejde,""

In english:

""When you read the numbers of foreign salaries in Denmark, one must take into account that one doesn't know exactly how long a person has been working in the country, and thereby one doesn't know exactly whether the low monthly pay reflects having worked two weeks or one month.""

I don't want to challenge you on whether workers from Soviet Countries are ""exploited"" - but let's try to be just a tiny bit factual/concrete for a moment. If an employer employs you outside of the conditions set by the parties of the work-market, they *can* be held accountable. And they often are. There are loads of unreported work done in several sectors, but this is extremely difficult to say anything about. This is corruption and most inferential statistics i've seen don't raise a flag that this is worse in Denmark than other european countries. 

Again, this is not to say that exploitation doesn't happen. There are definitely for example jobs that the youth in Denmark slowly feels above taking, or they are simply are not willing to put themselves through the hours/roughness of the job that people from post-soviet countries are. There is a reason for this. It is that these workers know of tougher working and living conditions. It's not that Danish genetics are somehow more molly cuddled. But importantly, these jobs are definitely covered by the conditions set forth by the work-market agreements.

UKGB,"Yeah, I've always thought that it was a completely logical conclusion that if you've got a common internal travel area, with a common visa policy then you *need* a common external border. I mean, a border is only as strong as the weakest point in that border. If there's 28 different national borders agencies, then there's a lot of different opportunities for those borders to be weak, and you need a common agency shared by all the member states to petrol it and apply uniform standards. 

This is a pan European problem and requires a pan-european solution.

,"&gt;So, i can only imagine you weren't actually stably employed for those 160 hours of work with a decent contract. 

This was a real job with a real contract and everything (doing C# and C++ on big projects, with time registration). Certainly it wasn't something I'd expect, but at the time (being naive) I chose to bit the bullet and hope for quick promotion (in upcoming 6 months) instead of becoming a welfare leech. It took me about 3.5 years to get to the same level of pay compared to a newly hired fresh Danish graduate. I quit shortly after that.

&gt;This is hugely different from all other work sectors and it is not special to Denmark.

I'd argue it's actually much more prevalent in low-skill and manual labor jobs as the other articles report.

The current situation in the Danish IT industry is that either  you underpay the foreign labor and keep the rest of Danes well payed or you outsource it completely, because there's whole world to compete against.

Considering the differences in wages within the EU this is all to be expected. There's no reason for business to pay Danes 5000 Euros brutto, if they can simply move the jobs to Czech Republic, Bulgaria or India and pay half of that for more hours of work. 

That is not to say the Danes are bad workers, it's simply a matter of the price of labor on the global market and diminishing burden imposed by duties and taxes.

&gt; Greece&amp;#039;s Alpha Bank, Eurobank, the National Bank of Greece and Piraeus Bank were all submitted to a health check by the ECB known as a &amp;quot;Comprehensive assessment&amp;quot;.

&gt; The National Bank of Greece reported a net loss of &amp;euro;1.614 billion for the second quarter, with provisions for bad loans in Greece soaring to &amp;euro;2.3 billion from 323 million in the first quarter.

Long story short, 2 weeks before that i got perma-banned from the forum by a Moderator unfit to moderate Europeans and generally western population at the whole.

Being unfit as he was, it took me with a help of one of the national CMs about 40 minutes to revert that ban with apologize from Scarper on top of that.

Lo and behold, the Mod in question didnt took me beating his permaban lightly and proceeded to stalk me all around the forums!

By the time the screenshot was current, the mod in question (from asia) was actually going as far as visiting Czech section on the forums and running everything i wrote there thru translator, just to get the opportunity to get back on me.

Got me pissed that instead of apologize he goes out of his way to get his vengeance for me beating his teenage ban with such ease.

So i asked him if he doesnt kinda want to stop, because it wasnt me who was wrong and perhaps its time to quit the stalking, apologize and move one.

The rest is in the screenshot, by the way check that P.S from him, Mod abuse like from the book....

Mind you the permaban he was trying to gave me before was entirely based on me writing word ""eastern"" in a sentence, thats why it was so easy to get that ban lifted.

Cena,"Okay, but first it's important to understand what capitalism is since you can't understand socialism without it.

The main observation behind socialism is that capitalism divides society into two distinct classes defined by their social relations to each other - the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Under capitalism, the means of production (factories, farmland, offices etc and other tools and resources required for production) are owned privately by the bourgeoisie. A proletarian is someone who has to sell his labor for wages to a bourgeois. Since the means of production are privately owned, a proletariat has no choice but to sell his labor and produce for the bourgeois instead of producing for himself. In order for the bourgeois to make money off the work of the proletariat, he has to continuously exploit the worker by paying him less than his labor is worth in order to turn a profit. A worker may produce $10 worth every hour but is only paid $5, the rest is pocketed by the bourgeois and/or invested to further expand and grow his capital. Exploitation in production is intrinsic to capitalism, it is how it has always functioned and how it will always function. Another key thing is that a capitalist produces for exchange value, he produces for the market regardless of any moral objections or actual use value of the goods produced. Capitalism cares for one thing, and that's profit, there's no room for producing for the well-being of people and no motivation to try and meet the needs of people unless there's profit to be made. Now, an ancap might say that he has massive amounts of food readily available and that this surely shows capitalism is superior for handling complexity and meeting the needs of people. But try and ask the homeless in America who sleep outside vacant houses or the workers who sweat and toil in the shadow of the bourgeoisie's glass towers just how great capitalism is at allocating goods.

Socialism is the antimatter of capitalism. Socialism wishes to do away with private ownership of the means of production (thereby abolishing the bourgeoisie as a class and creating a classless society), it wishes to rid the world of exploitation and seeks to produce for use value rather than exchange. The working class no longer has to sell its labor to the bourgeoisie since it owns and runs the means of production and can decide what to produce and how to allocate goods. A classless society where the workers run the means of production is the most basic element of socialism and why Denmark and the rest of the Nordic countries can not be considered socialist. In Denmark and the other Nordic countries, the means of production are still owned privately by the bourgeoisie. There is still exploitation, production for the market and the working class is still entirely subject to the free market and our well being depends on the well being of capitalism. Capitalism isn't doing well in Europe today, it is struggling to recover from the 2008 crisis and, if the whispers about a 2016 recession are true, will fall even further. As a result, no matter who we vote into the Nordic parliaments will be forced to enact policies which benefit the bourgeoisie over the proletariat such as cutting welfare, education, environmental efforts and giving tax cuts to the wealthy. It's a nicer form of capitalism than that in America, I suppose, but it is capitalism nonetheless with the same old ugly face of exploitation and farce of a democracy.

,"OK, you are one of these nutty fundamentalist Marxists that thinks everything comes from Marx and he is the only relevant political thinker in all of history despite the widespread discrediting of many of his ideas, got it.

Marx was certainly hugely influential but is certainly far from universally accepted as correct on anything. Most historians don't subscribe to historical materialism. There were socialists before Marx and many socialists after Marx that didn't adhere to Marxism.

But regardless of what your exact position on Marx is, the point is, almost no European socialist is calling for the nationalisation of all means of production. That's an extreme far left view that hasn't seen mainstream espousal in Europe since the collapse of the USSR.

Many European countries have a socialist party as one of their top two parties and many European countries frequently have socialist governments and leaders.

,"The type of anti-semitism that most American Jews experience is really non-threatening and stupid. It's someone making a stupid holocaust joke, or a punk kid spray painting a swastika on your trash cans. For centuries, anti-Semitism involved people dying in mass numbers for simply being Jewish. That really doesn't happen in most of the world, and it never happened in America.

It really bothers me when American Jews get so worried about rising anti-Semitism as if it's an impending holocaust. If you look at the rest of the comments in this thread, you'll see its mostly people dealing with immature bigots. The fact of the matter is this is probably the best time in history to be a Jew in the western world. I'll accept many places in the Middle East are definitely not safe for Jews, and there are areas in Europe that at present are uncomfortable for Jews, but we should be grateful at how well we are doing. 

If our ancestors who died in pogroms knew that we were freaking out so much about a Chabad menorah getting vandalised, or someone finding a swastika scribbled on a synagogue door they'd probably smack us across the head. Yeah, stuff that like is a cause for concern, but at the end of the day it almost never results in Jewish deaths.

We'll probably always have to deal with some sort of anti-Semitism. But I seen no reason to think that Jews are under some sort of existential threat.

Personally, I've been yelled at walking to shul a couple of times. I just brush it off and go on with my day. Being a Jew has had no measurable effect on my ability to gain employment or housing.

UKGB,"&gt; violent attacks on Homosexuals in camps go way beyond holding opinions. The same with sexual assault

Well, those are crimes. The evidence, though, that this is actually happening inside camps is very thin: claims of this sort appear to originate with a senior police officer who is known to hold extremist views, and thinks Germany should build a wall on the Austrian border to stop immigration.

&gt; expressing nazi opinions and views, on the contrary, is actually Illegal

Only if expressed in a manner that threatens public order.

&gt; The more controversial bit is really believe that if violent people commit crimes while trying to claim asylum then that should really be putting this status of needing protection under serious question.

Each case is to be judged on its own merits. When hundreds of traumatized people have to sleep together in a sports hall, punches can get thrown. But anyone -- refugee or no -- who is convicted of a crime will be dealt with.

&gt; it is true that refugees are refugees when they go to the next country and when they continue or all want to pick out a country that stretches the definition a lot.

These are people who know about as much about Europe as you or I do about the Middle East. What they know is that the countries bordering on their own either won't accept refugees at all, or badly mistreat them. They've also heard of this wonderful country in the middle of Europe that *will* accept refugees and not make them beg for food, demand bribes, arrest them for no reason, or cage them like animals. There are, it is true, some other countries that would take at least some of them on, but the average Syrian hasn't heard about them. There are stories of Austrian officials intercepting migrants on their way to Germany and having to tell them, ""No, honestly, you can stay here, Austria is every bit as good as Germany.""

&gt; I believe that putting money into the refugee camps, and then taking them directly from camps and making illegal crossings harder is superior for several reasons.

That's one idea that's been floated, and it seems to have a lot of merit to it. It's certainly logical. Unfortunately, on the evidence so far, a lot of the money isn't filtering down to where it's needed.

&gt; you can pick the most vulnerable from the turkish + Jordanian safe areas and keep them safer crossing officially

That would certainly be the goal, but it's bit late to put that into effect now. Besides, these camps house dozens of thousands of refugees: it would be a mammoth task to sort through them all and prioritize them.

&gt; especially not helping out the traffickers who routinely ditch people in the sea or lock them in trucks to die in squalid conditions.

The number of Syrians using people traffickers has dropped dramatically. The news has filtered through that there are better, less costly and safer ways of getting to Germany.

Yeah, Germany's more or less given up on that one. The other countries have to play ball, and they're not. That's the problem.

,"It might be easier to think of music notes in terms of 'semitones'. Adding a sharp to a note raises the note by exactly one semitone; adding a flat to a note lowers it by exactly one semitone. 

It always takes 12 semitones to make an octave. We can call these twelve tones, respectively, 1, 2, 3, 4,... and so on, to 12. '1' could represent any specific note.

Making a 'major scale' means arranging the semitones like this: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12. Just to emphasise again: it doesn't matter at all what note we start on, because it is the pattern, not the specific notes we use, that makes this a major scale. 

So regardless of which note we start on, a keyboard that is designed to facilitate the playing of major scales (the primary scale for European music) is going to have the 1,3,5,6,8,10,12 pattern. 

C major in particular enjoys the privilege of being entirely neutral because of historical reasons. But it doesn't matter which major scale we make 'all natural', because they'd make the exact same pattern. So if we decided to make F major all natural, for example, we'd have F G A B C D E F. However, what we call these notes doesn't change the fact that note 3 and note 4 needs to be a semitone apart, so we'd have no black key between A and B instead of no black key between B and C.

&gt; A. screwed up MLS’ multiple drafts by confusing which of the drafts he wanted the 1st pick for after Orlando chose the SuperDraft as theirs (he even laughed about the mistake).

This one is a legitimate gripe, though I don't know that Kreis would have gone after Larin anyway.

&gt; B. a poorly drafted team (severely lacking of players to pull off his famed 442 diamond, drafting George John on a flyer is fine if the defense isn’t relying on journeymen until his health is determined, RSL East set of players)

We had to build the core of our team out of scraps of the other teams - not a lot we could do there.  OCSC had the advantage of actually having a squad beforehand - we did not (and we only finished slightly behind Orlando anyway). He says we were severely lacking players to fit the system - well yea, we're an expansion team. Comes with the deal.

&gt; C: shite scouting (Mendoza- never played, Nemec- never scored &amp; was banished, Calle- never stayed healthy/how can a player get hurt three times in 12 appearances with non-contact injuries, Dunn – wasted a pick since he played less than a game) – Kreis has said he has final say on players. If true, this is damning.

Every team has it's albatrosses, but we cut off our dying limbs instead of holding onto them.  We don't have this wonderfully deep player pool to just be making cuts left and right.  At this stage of the club, *every* roster move makes a sizable impact.  As for Calle, how is that in any way the fault of Kreis or the scout team? If the guy can't stay healthy that's on him, not the club.  At any rate, the assessment here is all in hindsight.  Nemec has the body and the strength of a strike partner we needed for Villa (and he actually *can* score as we've seen for Slovakia) and his hold-up play was actually pretty good.  Dunn was a depth piece for this year who was developed in Europe and was *cheap* - a low-risk, high-reward scenario (you know, what scouts are supposed to find).

Our team was Frankenstein's monster, no doubt, but there's not much we could do about that with limited salary and limited international slots.

&gt; D: It’s now come out he was trying to trade Poku mid-season to Philly – WHAT THE FCK?!?!?

We don't know what was being offered for Poku.  Either way I wouldn't want him to leave, but if we got a 1st round pick and a player for him, maybe it would have been worth it.  Either way, without the full context it's irresponsible to criticize the move.  We have a logjam at his position and the players sitting in front of him are high-priced, ticket-selling players sent to Kreis from higher up.  If he could move Poku for immediate help in areas that we need it, maybe it was a viable thing to do.

----
The other thing, when he goes on about the ""Urban Legend"" of Kreis' coaching ability, he cites Kreis' lack of winning any trophies, and attributes his cup win to the situation he walked into. Well, it just so happens that even though Kries didn't *win* the trophies, he was runner up for the Supporter's Shield in 2010, was the CCL runner-up in 2011, finished second in the West in 2012 to the Shield-winning Quakes, and then finished Runner-up to both the MLS Cup *and* the USOC in 2013.

Let's not be disingenuous here.  If anything his reputation should say ""has trouble winning the big one"" - not ""his winning is a fluke.""

Just to represent it visually:

qualitycontributor,"Modified from an [earlier answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2btk3r/what_was_saddam_husseins_game_plan_for_holding/)

The lynchpin to Saddam's strategy for holding onto Kuwait rested upon his very skewed understanding of global politics and where Iraq stood within the international community. Iraq had garnered economic and military support from the various Gulf states during the Iran-Iraq War (for example, the Iraq Air Force had some dispersal airbases around the Gulf) and Saddam conflated this soft support with actual diplomatic strength. In 1989, the Saudis signed a non-aggression and military assistance pact with Iraq, and Saddam misconstrued as tacit Saudi approval of isolating Kuwait. He believed that since Iraq had protected the region from Iran, it would accept the price by acquiescing to the conquest of Kuwait. As Saddam explained to the Yemeni president in August 1990:

&gt;Iraq…who defends them [the Arabs] for ten years [and] they consider his defense as a liability against [Iraq]?…The time has come for every person to say…I’m Arabian…I’m Saddam Hussein…[If] Iraq will pay this amount of money to develop the Arab nation and to defend it [then] the other Arab countries must pay this amount of money…if they don’t we will fight them. 

Saddam had hoped that overtures to various Gulf states would fracture any attempt by the Saudis and exile Kuwaitis to form a response against his invasion. Although there was some validity to this assessment of Arab unity, Saddam woefully underestimated the fact that his use of armed force to resolve differences with Kuwait unified political opinion against him within the region.

Further afield, Saddam also did not understand the geopolitical changes that happened in 1989. In November 1990, his foreign Minister Tariq Aziz gave him optimistic reports that Gorbachev was not in favor of military action and would act to restrain the Americans:

&gt;as I have shared my opinion with you, deducing that the Soviet Union has no interest in a war of this manner happening and at this large scale. Maybe at the beginning and at different intervals the idea of a surgical [military] operation came up. [T]o hit Iraq and force it to withdraw from Kuwait, as maybe a disciplinary move for Iraq; it possibly entered their mind, but when they saw the reality and the fact that the Iraqi power was not something they could control in days or weeks and that this war will lead to major destruction in the region and to political and economic imbalance;
and because the Soviet Union is worried about Europe and has
internal problems, sir, they couldn’t imagine that the situation would explode in the Middle East, seeing that it is their southern border. If a war of this manner happens the situation will explode, the Islamic factor, the nationalistic factor, the oil, and security all these would explode….and as Primakov said to you when you met, after you told him that we would hit Israel, that that was a nightmare they didn’t want to see…[A] nightmare to the Soviet Union, not out of love or care for us, but a nightmare.

Additionally, Saddam hoped that France, which had developed economic and military ties to Iraq in the 1980s, would also break apart the Coalition. Both of these estimates were off base. Although the USSR was not happy about Gulf War, it was more preoccupied with the domestic turmoil that in hindsight was the signal of its impending breakup. A foreign intervention in the Middle East was the last thing Gorbachev needed, especially with memories of Afghanistan debacle still fresh. Aziz played up Mitterrand's ambiguous statements about the invasion and claimed that France would not jeopardize its domestic tranquility because of its large Algerian Muslim population. Attempting to use the French to split the Coalition had the opposite effect and the French behaved in a much more hardline fashion than Aziz anticipated. In some ways, Saddam learned the wrong lesson from the fall of the Berlin Wall; it made him feel that the age of the Superpowers was ending when instead it was leaving the US much greater latitude to act. 

In short, Saddam believed that if he occupied Kuwait, it would be a diplomatic and military fait acompli. Iraqi strategy was that by turning Kuwait into a large fortified area, the Coalition would naturally fracture and Iraq's occupation would be assured. In a ministerial conference of  August 1990, he said:

&gt;[W]e should focus on the historical event, such as the war between France and Germany in 1870 and during the First World War when France retrieved the Alsace Lorraine region and kept it united under regional policy laws, municipal laws, and autonomy after the First World War. France gradually extended its authority to this region until it became internationally and constitutionally part of France.

To be fair to Saddam, there were elements of his grand strategy that were viable. The problem was the Iraqi dictator had a pattern of consistently misreading his strengths. The Coalition was highly contingent upon a number of factors. Saddam thought time was on his side and to an extent he was correct. In May  1991 meeting with his senior army commanders he noted “we expected the entire world to react; we could not believe how long it took them to enter [the area].” Part of his rationale behind seizing Kuwait was that its borders were arbitrary colonial impositions and that both Arab leaders and the Arab street felt that these borders had no ultimate validity. 

While this view of the Middle East's borders was popular (and still is), Saddam's rhetoric and his actions, especially his use of military force to resolve the borders, threatened the very leaders he was trying to win over. His rationale for seizing Kuwait run roughshod over international law, Iraq had reaffirmed its earlier 1932 acceptance of Kuwait's borders in 1963 when it accepted Kuwait as a member of the Arab League. This gave any opposition to the invasion legal leverage to justify a military action.

One of the more pertinent examples of his misreading of international reaction was his handling of approximately 800 Western hostages (guests in Iraqi parlance) left inside Iraq. Saddam met with delegations from individual countries who would plea for the release of these individuals throughout August and November 1990. Based upon his statements in a Revolutionary Command Council meeting on 1 November 1990, he thought that this would create an international peace movement by making connections with other world leaders. He asserted in meetings that all he needed was to win two UNSC leaders to his side and the coalition would fall apart. What he was blind to was the fact that this hostage situation was a public relations disaster for Iraq. Saddam intended these meeting to demonstrate he was a tractable and sane leader when they often demonstrated the opposite. Here's an [archived ABC report]( http://abcnews.go.com/Archives/video/aug-23-1990-british-hostages-iraq-10799747) on how Saddam's public relations bid failed, the ""guests"" looked decidedly uncomfortable. 

Ultimately part of the problem was Saddam's only minister with extensive foreign experience was Tariq Aziz. But Aziz's connections and expertise were largely with the USSR and France. For example, Aziz was unaware of the nature of American style media questioning and conflated hard journalism with a widespread public antiwar sentiment:

&gt;these Americans are under daily [press] questioning, God help them, even the Americans, sometimes I see them being chased by the journalists…cornering a person…even [Secretary of Defense] Cheney has to give a response.

Many of Saddam's ministers shared the mistaken impression that time worked in Iraq's favor. Taha Ramadan, later Iraq's Vice President, asserted in November 1990 Revolutionary Command Council Meeting that the chances for peace were growing when in reality international opinion was growing more frustrated with Iraq. Again, much of the upper echelons of Iraq's leadership did not have much contact or experience abroad. The GMID (Iraqi military intelligence) had to rely upon Western press reports to discern the nature and scale of Coalition intentions.    

Ultimately, Joseph Sassoon sums up Saddam's situation quite aptly:

&gt;Although Saddam Hussein was astute in dealing with internal affairs he was less successful at understanding foreign powers. His inability to grasp the implications of invading Kuwait and his belief that the United States and coalition forces would not invade Iraq are two blatant examples of his misjudgement. In a pattern familiar to other dictators, the presentations of intelligence information and ideas presented by his inner circle became colored by the leader's own view, by the presenters' anticipation of what he really wanted to hear, or by fear of offending him.

The failure of the 1990 invasion to keep Kuwait and the subsequent marginalization of Iraq into a pariah state are pretty hard evidence against Saddam's competence as an international leader. In hindsight, Saddam was naive and possessed a highly mistaken grasp of foreign affairs.

,"Porto had been sealed off. Intel had sent in some of their more experienced men to dig out of those Americans as much as they could. And now, they couldn't leave. Because whatever it was that those men were carrying, it didn't register on the microbe scan. But it was there. Five hallowed eyed Intel officers were proof of that, but also the sixth that didn't show any signs of disease. Commander DeSalle cursed. Operation reclamation did NOT go as anticipated up until now.  
  
""DeSalle?""  
  
And now some feeble minded cadet had thought this the perfect moment to forget rank and file as well...  
  
""I will be addressed as Commander, cadet... Who are you?""  
  
It wasn't some cadet standing in behind him. As soon as he had turned around, he was greeted by a man in an obviscator suit. It made his eyes hurt.  
  
""I'm sorry, but I'm not here to adhere to your ridiculous chain of command. I'm here to make sure that you don't make any rash decisions and plunge the Commonwealth into another dark age. Now if you would please follow me?""  
  
DeSalle sighed. It appeared he didn't have a choice even if he didn't want to follow him. With a gesture, the man lead him to one of the chambers deeper into the Porto Decontamination complex and, once inside, directed him to a seat.  
  
""Care for a drink, DeSalle?"" He politely refused while he sat down. ""Thank you, but I'm fine. I have a lot to do and not a lot of time, so I'd rather you get to the point. Why has the Commonwealth such an interest in these men? Last time I checked, the navy was tasked with anything and everything American. Or did I miss one of your votes again?""  
  
Within a split second, the obviscator suit deactivated and he was not greeted by a man, but a woman. Sporting a very, very nasty looking ocular implant. ""Please keep your disdain for your government to yourself. I am here on special Commonwealth instructions and, as with you, I have no time to play games; I'm not a politician. Now if you please would be so kind to look at the screen?""  
  
A holoscreen had just buzzed to life, showing a revolving globe. The Americas were in focus and a dotted line crossed the Atlantic from northern america to Europe.  
  
""Now, as I'm sure you're aware of the history of the Curtain and it's use, let me start by telling you why it's there in the first place. Please observe.""  
  
A zoom into a part of northern america revealed a crater. A very, very large one. DeSalle swallowed unwittingly. He had seen the craters created by molecular bombs on the Phobos test range. This one was bigger.  
  
""What you are seeing is known as the Yellowstone Caldera. It is a super volcano that wasn't supposed to erupt for another ten thousand years. However, a skirmish between the then United States of the Americas and the Korean Empire resulted in the caldera becoming unstable. Both armies used one of the last generation of tactical nuclear fusion bombs on the North American theater. Some of our sources say this is because the Korean Emperor, Kim-Hong Dung, was setting things right for wrongs he feel were imposed by a predecessor of the USotA, in a time when that country only inhabited the northern americas. The detonation of the Empire's fusion bomb..."" a vid started playing over the continent, ""caused an underground magma chamber in the old Yellowstone park to fill up faster than anticipated, even by American estimates. While their government was busy retaliating, the volcano exploded.""  
  
Another vid-overlay. It made him cringe. An area the size of the main European Commonwealth was obliterated with such force that  the complete american continent must have been shaking on its foundation. The large cities, easily visible from space, were obliterated within hours. And at that moment, the vid went dead.  
  
""That's the last image that particular satellite was able to pick up before the electromagnetic storm caused by the cataclysmic eruption cloud knocked it out. A lot of our surveillance equipment over the continent didn't make it out of that explosion and it took us a few hours to re calibrate the network and guide other satellites to the area.""  
  
Ash. The whole continent was covered in ash. Communication with it was sparse to say the least. DeSalle swallowed again. That must have been millions of dead people, if not more, within a few hours...  
  
""Before you ask: yes, the Curtain was already built at that moment. Our own scientists were not so eager to wait out for Yellowstone to erupt and instead of pooling our resources into our army like the USotA and the Empire did, we constructed the Curtain to make sure that whatever happened over there, would not reach us. At first, this is all that it did: keep the ash and soot at bay. A hundred years after the eruption, however, the African Union reported that a disease had started spreading through their lands. Their scientists soon discovered that it came from American survivors, who were still trying to make their way via the southern continent to African nations. It was not nice...""  
  
Images of the same hallowed eyed people as those he had sitting on the contamination unit flashed by. Some were seen attacking each other, relief workers, anything that moved. Others would just sit there, staring with blank faces into the camera. It was quite unsettling.  
  
""We have termed it the neo-plague. It spreads fast and is almost always lethal. If not from the disease itself, then because of the violent tendencies it awakens by stripping the emotional center of the brain from everything except aggression. The migration of American survivors into the European Commonwealth almost triggered a new mass extinction, had we not put a stop to it and activated the Curtain's full capability. Nothing can pass the Curtain except for biological matter. And that brings us to today. For a thousand years we have kept them at bay and, yes, have awaited an invasion. However, it would appear that the people there have evolved to be able to withstand the disease. It is therefore in Commonwealth interest that we take over this investigation, as my employers wish to understand what it is that makes the disease tick and to eradicate it where possible. The americas could be used for much crops, as our satellites have shown that it is still sparsely populated. Also, do not be fooled by the looks of people."" She swiped up an image of the quarantine room, with the five obviously sick Intel officers and the sixth, apparently healthy one. ""He is as much a carrier as they are and releasing him will cost the lives of many. So... Have I made my point?""  
  
DeSalle nodded in agreement. This was something he did not wish to partake in and if he could shove it into the shoes of the Commonwealth without sacrificing his own highly trained people, all the better. ""I will transfer them to your care. Porto has requested to know when they can have their harbor back? That's your thing now. By the way..."" He nodded to the globe. ""What happened to this Korean Empire? I have never heard of it?""  
  
The woman smirked. ""The predecessor to the Commonwealth, the European Union, glassed it and Kim-Hong Dung from orbit as punishment for his arrogance. What was once their peninsula is now the main supplier of solar power for the region. Oh, and before you leave,"" The woman blocked his exit. ""I need not remind you that what you have learned today is above top secret. Are we clear?""  
  
DeSalle made a tired motion with his head and lifted his hand for a handshake. ""I'm Navy, not Space Brat. I know what's at stake if anyone found out what happened, miss...""  
  
""Good. I will await your transfer of operational data. Have a good day. And it's De Rien."" She shook his hand and smiled.  
  
When DeSalle entered the canteen after he was done with all the paperwork and the transfer of the codes, he plunged down in his chair exhausted. He felt a little bit bad for those poor Intel officers, but then again they should've known that stepping inside there without proper protection was a one-way trip to hell. He grabbed a cafdrink and glared out over the harbor. *That's funny,* he thought. *Her name was nothing...*",WritingPrompts,0,1,Borg-Man,1,1446395980,1446392902,t1_cwjowzm,t5_2s3nb,cwkh0j5,t3_3qypud,,1447331633,,0,

This brings me onto the liberalism that governs the US psyche in ways it doesn't pervade European attitudes. 


&gt;[Right now Huffman and the rest of the reddit administration have come up with some strange and inelegant ways of dealing with the present problem. **They make all these dubious distinctions between action and speech; between inciting harm and just abstracting wishing it on people; and lots of blanket “I know it when I see it” sorts of decency rules. Under liberalism** redditors would be right to demand very specific descriptions of the “I know it when I see it” kinds of moments. **But if prominent members were to just be upfront in stating what sort of community they would like to see and then acting as if it already existed, discontents would have to persuade admins that they were acting against their own interests and propose a more compelling way to achieve the stated utopia.** If they don’t like the utopia at all, then those people can leave for Voat and new users who like that utopia might come to replace them. At the very least, reddit were to take this approach, users might actually start answering the question that is at the heart of the matter but is rarely stated in explicit terms: who gets to be a part of the community?](http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2015/07/17/reddit-cannot-be-governed-it-can-only-be-persuaded/)


What incentives do you have to persuade haters, trolls and assholes who feed off being able to act destructively off an online forum? Do stoop down to their level and try to bully them away? Do you give them the attention they want to try to persuade them to change their behavior? Since reddit is built around it taking 10 seconds to make a new account, banning people isn't very effective. You have to ban domains, communities, phrases. In terms of free speech, that's like trying to sculpt sugar-glass with an unruly rock hammer.

This is where a liberalist approach to free speech is antiquated: the US is the only developed country in the world that doesn't ban hate speech (in some form or another). That functions just like the US has rules against other types of speech. The bright line rule in US law is *imminently* causing harm, absolving people who don't specifically ask/tell people to do something bad of the responsibility of proclaiming hateful, destructive ideologies that **will predictably** lead to negative repercussions for those you discriminate against. Spez even acknowledged that in the earlier segments of that interview from a year ago where he took the moral stance of disallowing and therefore refusing to facilitate targeted hate. Speech has consequences and the power of the word influences future actions. As a platform, reddit is morally responsible for how that platform is used (even if they aren't legally), just as an editor of a publication is responsible for what they allow to be published. 

What about the model that the rest of the developed world uses, one where you ban hate speech (in some form of other) just as the US has rules against other types of speech because the idea that more speech is necessarily freer is bunk. That's the exact argument [the EFF uses to encourage social sites to disallow harassment](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/facing-challenge-online-harassment). That's where [reddit got its wording on anti-harassment](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/ct5rxah?context=3). 


I think that also characterizes why the problematic symptoms of how the admins are handling themselves aren't being resolved: the whole American liberalist way of loking at the world is outdated. There's a reason only the world's oldest constitution still has these extremely broad, unlimited rights codified as law, because in practice it doesn't work well.


The issue is that the admins are doing everything in their power not to take a stance. Not to come out and say ""US free speech laws are antiquated, the EFF does harm because it doesn't take a stance on hate speech. More speech isn't freer speech: just look at our recent rule against revenge porn, our rules against (legal) doxxing, legal distasteful images of children, legal harm-communities like /r/beatingwomen and so on""

It is exactly like the article says: communities (through mods) need to take a stance and just ban/remove the destructive nonsense from their communities. Ignoring haters, trolls and bigots. Silencing them.  The admins want each community (subreddit) on reddit to do that for themselves because it embellishes the fantasy that reddit is a general platform, not itself one big community of ""Redditors"" that have very clear cultural norms that differ from Facebookers, 4channers, tumblrers, and so on.

It's just nigh on impossible to get hundreds or thousands of communities to pull in the same direction. Can we self-facilitate standardizing some subredidt rules, like ones against hate speech, personal information, insults, spam and so on, so redditors don't have to memorize hundreds of different sets of rules? Will the admins try to facilitate that sort of activity through /r/modsupport, or are they still desperately clinging onto being ""As content agnostic as possible"" as a platform, well, unless it is directly and imminently harmful to people.

---

But I think it's just naive to suggest that when afforded internet anonymity and ""unlimited get out of jail"" cards for breaking community norms, anarchism is *the* solution, or even a viable alternative. If in-person political debates have shown one thing, it's that moderation is often necessary to be able to sustain a topical conversation. The whole idea of reddit is that someone needs to sort content (through voting), and moderators are necessary for that to work on this platform. People don't default to behaving well online.

To build on that argument further and to underpin that reddits [values themselves](https://www.reddit.com/about/values) where they've codified that they *won't* take a stance because of ""the community owning itself"" and how that's incompatible with ""giving people voices"" by ""Creat[ing] a safe space to encourage participation"" aren't smart sociological choices or even compatible on the base. You don't get to ignore that when [reflection on how reddit has become a platform out to ""get people""](https://youtu.be/CbGxKKJb7vk?t=1659) and to crucify them in the court of public opinion. 

Here's a comparison to drive the point home: in the marketplace of blogs and letters to editors, let's say one newspaper gets a reputation for only publishing letters that complain about things. That's how it starts, everyone loves a good complaint, no harm in complaining about the small irritating things in life that are mildly infuriating. There's a selection going on: among newspapers people who like a good rant flock to this newspaper more  than others. Reddit is becoming the site that allows people to publish their morally repulsive junk.

Reddit [doesn't have a history of going down slippery slopes](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3dwn73/why_its_ridiculous_to_use_i_do_not_agree_with/ct9dulz?context=3). How many Western countries have anti-hate speech laws ingrained in their concepts of free speech? How many disallow holocaust-denial? In practically all those countries, you can still draw offensive caricatures of whatever religious figure you like. There's no slope to fall down here: you can ban haters without neutering people being brashly critical. The ""keep the filth"" people on reddit seem to fear counterfactuals and possible futures that haven't manifested throughout areas where hate speech is legislated appropriately. It feels like a manifestation of anti-authoritarian fears: give an inch and they'll take a mile.

Interacting in virtual space is different from doing so in person. You can distill communities where you filter out all dissenting voices and reaffirm any opinion: pro-ana, bug chasing, incest, bestiality, self-harm, domestic abuse. People can lose touch with reality, and that type of communication hasn't been possible on its current scale before the internet.

Those at the cutting edge of these sociological and ethical situations need to embrace that competence as well:  does reddit even have a behaviorist or someone educated in ethics/philosophy to work through these problems in a systematic and academically sound way?

So to be blunt in summary: I don't think you've got a leg to stand on in defense of keeping haters around. The effects of keeping hate around are clearly negative and lead to negative things in people's real lives too. Keeping it around for the sake of outdated free speech theories from the 18th century isn't credible.

.

&gt; Europe's 733 million people make up 12% of the world's population as of 2012... Northern America, primarily consisting of the United States and Canada, has a population of around 352 million (5%)

.

I think the 10% number is the anticipated 2020 figure, so today it's closer to 15% because in Europe and in America there are significant non-European populations. (maybe 13%)

Either way...  15%...  13%...  or 10%...  it's a fricken low number.

.

My point is that it's a **myth** that what we call ""minorities"" are really numerically a smaller population in the world.

There is an abundance of Africans and Asians in the world and a small European presence.  These are hard cold facts that myths like ""diversity"" tend to try to cover over.

The Oligarchs don't give a damn about national identities and only care about exploiting workers and the cheaper they can get workers the better.  All the trends in globalization benefit the Oligarchs and work against identities.

MCHGLB,"&gt; How does having a small business (1-3 employees) or being self-employed look like in practice in Germany, Austria and Switzerland?

Can only speak of Germany but it's a lot of overhead. Regulations regarding employees are plentiful and sometimes really complex. And if you don't watch out you can find yourself with criminal charges pretty quick (best example: Business isn't doing too well. You don't have enough money to pay both employee's wage and their social contributions. What do you do? Pay the wages or pay the social contributions? If you act like 'gee dudes need to eat so I pay them the wages' you just committed a crime).

The digitalisation of dealing with authorities isn't also top of the line. You have to do your taxes electronically but still need to sign and send a shit ton of snail mail papers to them. Every department has a different kind of system running.

If you know how it's done in the UK: Germany is pretty much the opposite when it comes to ease of use/access. (Example: If you want to register a business (nothing fancy, just a sole proprietorship) you can fill out an electronic form and it gets submitted to the authorities. But you still need to show up at the Ordnungsamt with a printout of the form you just submitted over the internet and sign a bunch of documents).

Also Amtsdeutsch ... the language that is used in communications from the authorities ... is a problem in itself. It often causes grief to native Germans because it's so tedious to read and not easy to understand. If you don't have a very strong command of the German language prepare to suffer (or to leave money on the table because tax authorities make mistakes and it's up to you to correct them).

Then taxes ... which can be high and which you can heavily influence. But for that you need to be ontop of tax regulations because the line between legal tax optimization and illegal avoidance is a pretty fine one here. 

Of course there's also good sides: Like one of the biggest markets in the EU, no relevant corruption when it comes to authorities, no arbitrariness because you can fight out everything infront of a court. It has its pros and cons.

,"1. Nej, det löser inga problem, men det förvärrar inte heller och samtidigt ger Sverige en paus och därmed en chans att integrera de otaligt många invandrare som har kommit de senaste åren istället för att fortsätta placera de ute i ett ghetto, ta in fler, sätta de i något annat ghetto, ta in än fler, mer ghetto, som man har gjort.

IREL,"&gt;How do you explain Jeremy Corbyn? He calls himself a Democratic Socialist, just like Sanders, but he's just a Social-Democrat.

Not really, he's been on the hard left of the Labour party for quite some time, and he has expressly stated that the ultimate goal of society should be the public ownership over the means of productions. Granted, he's become much more moderate as party leader, but nonetheless, he's still a socialist. 

&gt;Ed Miliband said he was bringing Socialism back to Britain

Most of the Labour party do, even the soft left on occasion. It's more to do with connections to the past than a genuine aspiration for a socialist government.  

&gt;Socialism means different things to different people

I guess this is a fair point but still, the most common definition is the social ownership over the means of production, at least in Europe.  

&gt;you're using the Marxist definition

No, he's not. This definition would be accepted by most leftists, be they anarchists, syndicalists, communists, or democratic socialists. 

&gt; but there was this Austrian dude who claimed Socialism was embracing and working to collectively further the noble Aryan master race.

The Nazi party appropriated certain words to appeal to a specific demographic, namely the German working class. In reality, the Nazis were vehement opponents of Socialism. As a matter of fact, they saw it as a ""judeo-Bolshevik"" plot undermining nationalism and traditionalism. Both socialists and communists were routinely arrested, and in many cases, sent to concentration camps. Hell, even the left of the party was purged.

&gt; And those would be studies CBS will review. That said, to my knowledge Australia and NZ do not hav e a history of a tainted blood supply. CBS have unfortunately inherited a legacy from Red Cross.

NZ, EU and the American Red Cross have already reviewed and resoundingly endorsed/adopted it.

Bayer and Sanofi were unbelievably negligent in the tainted blood scandal. They didn't test plasma products at all, for anything. The tainted blood scandal didn't happen because gay people weren't banned from giving blood.

,"Part 2

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
But *League of Legends* is a game where a lot is possible. Sensational comebacks and crazy turns, pretty much every player and fan knows them. The second game starts with a bomb shell: An unfamiliar mistake by SKT leads to two early losses, which are abused by the Tigers to get a small gold advantage. ""Koo, Koo, Koo"" echoes through Berlin's arena, a sound like an owl, but louder and increasingly intensive. Is something possible for KOO? The fans believe so; there's a murmur going through the crowd before every *teamfight*, a battle with some or all heroes. The players move their figures with frantic speed, projectiles and spells collide and then - a mistake by the KOO Tigers, SKT conquers their base. Dissapointment. Disillusionment. It makes one want to pull ones hair (or plush hats) out. Is this apparently overpowered team truly unbeatable?

Spoiler: It isn't. Even though a few fans already expect to be at home in time for the Bundesliga, the KOO Tigers have  another plan, particularily not losing anything anymore. The usually restrained team goes in fully. No tactics, no small skirmishes. Full offense instead. It works: The usually so unremarkable Hojin of the Tigers manages to get four kills within the first minutes, after five minutes the misfits are leading 5:1 and apply pressure on SKT everywhere on the map. Even the superstars Marin and Faker seem to have no answer. With every passing minute the hall grows louder.

**The sensation is perfect**

Then suddenly, the cheers ""Koo Tigers! Koo Tigers!"", followed by rythmic clapping and, no joke, a La-Ola-Wave. It's moments like this that show the appeal of esports as a live-event. Ten people sit in the middle of the hall, their fingers seemingly stoic on their mouse and keyboard, their gaze fixed on their screens. Yet their actions thrill a whole arena, a good play is like a good goal in football, electrizing, euphorizing. In the end KOO Tigers do the impossible: They break SKT's 19 win streak - and win the hearts of the Berlin audience.

The Tigers wanted to be cheered and loved like the big ones, like SKT and Faker, and the european favorites Fnatic. They managed that, and maybe that acknowledgement is the only thing they'll get from this finale. In the fourth and final game SKT shows once again their class. They play their game with chirurgical precision and don't give KOO Tigers any chance. In the end Faker kisses the Trophy, called the Summoner's Cup, for the second time in his young career. It's a deserved win, no question and even the audience acknowledges that with honest applause.

And the inferior KOO Tigers? They are happy nonetheless, rise from their seats, hug their fellow countryman and turn smiling and waving to the fans in the audience.

,"A comprehensive review by The Intercept of the writings of Sam Charles Hamad — author of this Daily Beast article accusing the “global left” of remaining “silent” on abuses by Russia — reveals that he has been completely silent, shockingly and appallingly so, about the following wide array of severe global injustices, never once writing about, let alone condemning, any of this:

Police brutality in Peru (“police and the armed forces have been granted a ‘license to kill’ demonstrators”)

High-level corruption in Malaysia (“a $681 million payment made to what is believed to be [Prime Minister] Najib’s personal bank account”)

Fascism in the Ukraine (key militia led by “a political figure that is often described as an extremist, ultranationalist and fascist”)

Prison overcrowding and police murder sprees in Brazil (“overcrowded, violent and brutalizing”; “every year Brazil’s police are responsible for at least 2,000 deaths“)

Imprisonment of a publisher in Zimbabwe for running articles the government disliked (“convicted of publishing a newspaper in a southern town without government permission”)

Arrests of Muslims for their political views throughout Europe (where Hamad studied) and outlawing of BDS activism in France

Devastating mistreatment of migrant workers and outlawing of homosexuality (with a little-used death penalty) by Qatar (for whose media outlet, al-Araby, Hamad writes)

Mass human rights violations by Indonesia (“The Indonesian government continues to arrest peaceful protesters. … Security forces responsible for serious violations of human rights continue to enjoy impunity”)

Due process-free imprisonment and other pervasive abuses in Kenya (“arbitrary arrests and detentions, extortion, and other abuses against Somalis”)

Starvation and severe hunger in South Sudan (“At least 30,000 people are facing starvation in South Sudan. … Two years of civil war have left nearly 4m people — particularly young children — facing severe hunger”)

The still unsolved, deeply suspicious disappearance of 43 students in Mexico (“serious doubts surround the official version of events”)

Violent, brutal persecution of Muslims in Burma by the Buddhist majority (“thousands of members of the Rohingya Muslim minority are fleeing persecution … they are being turned away from Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand” . . . . “Nearly one million Rohingya were deprived of the vote earlier this year on the grounds they could not prove their families had been long resident in Myanmar”)

Serious threats, discrimination and violence against LGBT citizens in Uganda (“if some Ugandan politicians have their way, coming out as homosexual could mean life in prison, or worse“)

Increasingly violent Hindu nationalism in India aimed at the Muslim minority (“Is Modi’s India Safe for Muslims?”)

Use of brutal child labor in Bangladesh to provide garments to the U.K., where Hamad is a citizen (“factories producing clothes for British retailers are forcing girls as young as 13 to work up to 11 hours a day in appalling conditions“)

What could possibly explain Hamad’s stunning, disgraceful silence about these massacres, abuses, injustices, and extreme levels of avoidable human suffering? One might conclude from his utter silence that he supports these heinous actions. Or perhaps he is an apologist for the perpetrators, seeking to conceal their culpability by never acknowledging these crimes? Or he could just be a propagandist, fixating on certain acts of abuse and violence committed by some regimes while systematically ignoring those of others.

Or could it be that — as a single individual with finite time and energy — he’s capable of focusing only on a relatively small handful of injustices at once, and chooses the ones where he thinks he can have the greatest impact, thus necessarily paying little to no attention to other grave injustices where he thinks he can have little or no effect? Or might it be that he perceives that some injustices receive a great deal of attention in the West (e.g., the Evils of Russia, China and Iran) but that other injustices receive far less attention (those perpetrated by the West and its allies) and thus chooses — as a corrective of sorts — to devote himself to trying to shine much-needed light on the ones that are typically overlooked or ignored entirely?

No, it cannot be that, because — like so many others — he has declared that paying attention to some injustices but not all injustices constitutes “a gruesomely perfect example of … hypocrisy.” So, as he and like-minded advocates have taught us, there must be something pernicious and deeply morally culpable in his silence and the silence of so many like him on this panoply of world horrors.

It’s possible that Hamad has actually condemned all of these terrible abuses and we just didn’t find his denunciations. Why do I say that? Because people like Hamad constantly accuse people like me (who choose to focus on the bad acts of our own government and its allies) of refusing to condemn abuses committed by Russia (“nowhere in any of Greenwald’s output will you find actual recognition of the victims of the Russian strikes and the circumstances that led to their deaths”) even though I’ve done so many times. Or worse, they insinuate that people like Noam Chomsky “actively support” such crimes while ignoring his unequivocal denunciations (“Let’s take [Russian] policy in Syria … Russia is supporting a brutal, vicious government”).

So given how often people like Hamad falsely accuse others of ignoring abuses by Russia through sheer fabrication of their actual record, I’m open to the prospect that he has actually condemned the above abuses and we just didn’t find them. But our research in this regard was quite thorough, and I’ll be happy immediately to note any links he provides where he has written about the abuses in the above list.

Needless to say, the highly selective moral outrage expressed by Sam Charles Hamad is not the point here. The point is the incredibly deceitful, miserably common, intellectually bankrupt tactic that The Daily Beast just aired: smearing people not for what they write, but for what they don’t write. It’s something I encounter literally every day, almost always as an expression of the classic “whataboutism” fallacy — ironically depicted in the West as having been pioneered by Soviet Communists — designed to distract attention from one’s own crimes (OK, fine, we just bombed a hospital in Afghanistan, are constantly droning innocent people to death, and are arming the Saudi slaughter of Yemeni citizens, but look way over there: Why don’t you talk more about Russia????).

And that’s to say nothing of the ignoble history of this tactic in the U.S. — dating back to the height of McCarthyism — of declaring people suspect or morally unhealthy due to a failure to condemn Russia with sufficient vigor and frequency. For decades in the U.S., one could be accused of being a “Kremlin sympathizer” without ever having uttered a syllable of support for Russia, and that’s still just as true today, if not more so. That’s accomplished by a constant measuring of how much one devotes oneself to the supreme loyalty test of publicly denouncing the Ruskies.

This tawdry, self-serving, self-exonerating tactic rests on multiple levels of deceit. “Hypocrisy” always meant “contradicting with words or actions one’s claimed principles and beliefs” (e.g., lecturing the world on freedom and human rights while arming and funding the world’s worst tyrannies). It is now being re-defined to mean: “one who denounces some terrible acts but not all.” If that’s the new standard, it should be applied to everyone, beginning with those who most vocally propound it. As a result, from now on, I’ll be asking the endless number of people who invoke this standard to show me their record of denunciation and activism with regard to the above list of abuses.

I actually find the history of this kind of fascinating.

Relevant part of the article:

&gt; To this day, Europeans rarely put ice in their drinks, but Americans do. Thanks to the low price of ice in the United States, Rees said, people here “developed a taste for cold drinks faster and stronger than anyone else.” This required active involvement from Tudor, who sent operatives to go from bar to bar trying to convince owners to incorporate his product into drinks. To make the sale, Tudor committed to giving some bartenders free ice for a year, figuring that customers would so enjoy the clink in their glasses that other local bars would feel pressure to put in orders. “The object is to make the whole population use cold drinks instead of warm or tepid,” Tudor wrote in his diary. “A single conspicuous bar keeper...selling steadily his liquors all cold without an increase in price, render it absolutely necessary that the others come to it or lose their customers.” ",AskReddit,0,1,cactusbrandy,1,False,1446396824,t1_cwkfuup,t5_2qh1i,cwkj40w,t3_3r2siv,,1447332620,,0,

I'd honestly expect Eurostat to use accurate wording too, which is why it would be foolish of them to use the word house without defining it. In the only major country with English as its primary language, and a country that has about 13% of the EU population, ""average house price"" doesn't refer just to houses but all homes. You'd think the folks at Eurostat would be switched on enough to note that and define their terms, but then if it's been made up by the French it's probably intentionally done to be as awkward as possible, the better to convince everyone that French is still important and useful.

,"It is important to question the ideas and decisions of people in authority. As history suggests, questioning authority is necessary for progress.

In the turn of the century around 1000, Roman Catholicism was the dominant religion in Europe. Martin Luther, a minister, held some criticism of the Catholic Church. He believed that the sale of indulgences was un-Christian. In addition, he believed that the only connection to God was on a personal level, contrary to the Catholic belief of having to go through the clergy (the Bishops, fathers, Pope, etc.) to have a relationship with God. Luther publicly criticized the authoritarian and christianess [sic] of the Roman Catholic Church by posting his 95 Theses: a list of criticisms. This was important for progress as it led to the Protestant Reformation, a movement which created many modern denominations, which were pure and free from the greed of the Catholic Church.

Vital in the formation of modern-day Russia, the Russian Revolution was triggered in part by the questioning of the Roman dynasty. Since the 1600's Russia had been ruled under a monarchy. However in 1907, that drastically changed. A group called the Bolsheviks was tired of the authoritarian rule of the Romanovs and sought to overthrow their tyrannical government. Their questioning of authority led to a violent revolution, which ended up benefitting the country. The Bolsheviks took over the government with a Communist platform and brought the country out of its perils and into progress. They re-instated food programs that lacked in the previous government and made sure the people were fed well so they could live. 

As history shows to us, it is important to question the ideas and decisions in people of authority. Whether it be Martin Luther questioning the authority of the Catholic Church to create a more Christ-like Christianity or the Bolsheviks questioning the authority of the Romanov dynasty to create a better Russia, it is essential to question authority so that progress can be made.

,"*Sigh*

&gt; You have 2 feet. You have a thumb. There are literally 2 borders; one to your north and one to your south. Hell, you could even travel further south and have even more options.

Hitchhiking can be dangerous for the driver and passenger, and with our more security oriented culture, greater access to transport and higher perceived danger level due to the media, it is definitely on the decline with fewer people offering and requesting it. Assuming you don't get murdered, run out of money/food and don't get lost or stranded on your way to your destination however, there is a whole new set of problems in finding employment.  
Not to mention the US is a vast country - often we Europeans have our remarks on Americans lacking a global perspective as they don't travel rebuked with arguments based on cost and the size of America. This would also work against any American looking to emigrate.  
And if an American should wish to go further afield to make something of themselves, then those costs will be even greater (and thumbing a lift wont be possible either). All of these factors conspire against any potential poor American emigrants.

&gt; But you don't.  

&gt;You know why? Because you acknowledge that moving somewhere with zero opportunity (assuming you actually put forth the effort to learn the language- which I know is probably too much to ask of you) would be a far shittier deal than working to better yourself in nation which affords you actual opportunity.

&gt;Anyone who truly wants to move, can move.

I don't have to time to go off and trawl all the employment statistics currently, but here is a summary. Mexico is not a great idea. More violent and less opportunity (why do you think there are so many Mexican immigrants in the states?), not to mention you would need to learn to understand a different language and culture. So that's pretty much a bust and you have a point.  
Canada is a different story. Higher taxes and such yes, but also a more comprehensive welfare system to get your back (once you've managed to integrate into their society properly). Currently lower employment (5.1% in the US vs 7.1% Canadian) however the difference is much less when both are adjusted to the american measurement system (5.1% US vs 6.0% Canada).  
So yes, currently you have better employment prospects in the states, overall. However Canada has a rapidly ageing population and faces a labour shortage before the end of the decade which will drastically improve job prospects - the same cannot be said for the US as immigration has helped somewhat stabilise the US population age (immigrants bring down the overall age of the population in general - controlled immigration is one avenue by which western nations can compensate for reduced birth rates and ageing populations). So Canadian employment has similar prospects nnow and much brighter prospects in the near future. Plus one for going to Canada.

&gt; That right there tells me just how privileged you are.  
Being later followed by  
&gt; Our nation has a shocking inequality of **motivation**, which **rightly** causes our ""inequalities of wealth"". The system works as intended.  
gave me a giggle.

it seems you are the privileged one. Yes, there are lazy people in society - these problems are even more apparent here in the UK with our vastly superior (in terms of what it offers to claimants) welfare system.  
Schooling quality is positively correlated with the wealth of the neighbourhood the school serves. Thus, the poorest in society are disadvantaged as they receive poorer education compared to those from more privileged backgrounds. On top of this employment is (unsurprisingly, if you think about it) also lower in the poor neighbourhoods.  
These factors stack up - kids can't get a decent education in the poor neighbourhoods and neither they nor their families can afford to pay for a better one - even getting part time work to help support themselves can be a task in and of itself. Which leaves them with one real option - move to a neighbourhood with better local schools. But that isn't an option either - why? Because *they're still poor!*  
These people get locked in a vicious cycle and only the lucky get out, often through winning scholarships to a good school and working their ass off at whatever it is they are there to do. The problem with this approach? Some people will never be good enough academically or at sport to achieve these scholarships, no matter how hard they try - so they get stuck and often give up eventually, as most people would. These people along with the naturally lazy slackers then give people like you the ammunition to make sweeping generalisations like you have and sweep the problem under the rug.

,"*I am definitely lost.*

The thought finally pounded its way into Robert Brownson's head as he wandered through the Alps. Backpacking in Europe had seemed like such a great idea before. What happened? *I dropped my phone and got lost, that's what happened.* Robert sighed, knowing the voice in his head of that of himself rather than the Other. At least there was a great view. Eventually, he came to the consensus that unless he ran into something, he'd unpack his tent and sleep wherever he could, then see if he could find something in the morning.

After another hour of walking, it was getting dark, and the air was starting to get thinner. Was he walking in the right direction? Was the snow getting deeper? Robert was feeling his mind swirling, the Other beginning to become restless. He was struggling over a snow bank when he slipped and fell, falling face first into the snow. The cold was almost unbearable, despite his thick clothing. For a minute, he simply laid there, drained of energy. But then he felt warmth. Slowly, Robert lifted his head out of the snow. *Is that… a bridge?* He got to his feet and charged forward, suddenly feeling renewed with energy. It *was* a bridge!

Without stopping, Robert raced across to the other side, a smile on his face. Maybe there was a town. Maybe he was *saved.* As his feet fell upon stone, he looked up. That was when he skidded to a stop, nearly falling over from the sudden shift in weight from his backpack. A massive castle loomed upon him. He felt the Other bristle. Something wasn't right. Robert looked back, towards the bridge. Walking to the edge, he looked down. There was a pool of lava bubbling and flowing below. *What the fuck is going on here?* Now he felt confused. After a few moments of simply standing, a breeze began to build. *Well, the castle is better than a tent, I guess.* With a sigh of resignation, Robert made his way towards the building, finally reaching the front door.

I'm big on international relations and global governance, so I don't care too much about domestic policies.

He is taking a more active role combating terrorism and extremism in the Middle East, and former French colonies in Africa, and has tempered Merkel a bit on economic priorities within the Eurozone. That is a huge deal, since the EU has historically been led by a tacitly equal partnership between France and Germany. The Eurozone crisis has essentially forced Germany into Europe's reluctant leader while France has fallen back a step. Germany has greatly mismanaged its new role by its failure to create consensus among EU members and organize effective and quick responses to the numerous crises that have plagued the EU for the past decade. Hollande has brought France closer to the United States on many international issues, and has helped undo the rift in relations caused by the Iraq War. He has proven a more powerful force in Brussels than his predecessor, Sarkozy, who was more or less Merkel's henchman in Paris. Now, more than ever, it is important that France returns to its position as Germany's equal in the EU because Germany has proven incompetent, the UK is increasingly aloof, and Italy isn't rich or strong enough to play at the big kids table.

,"Hey guys, I have been a lurker for a long time and I have to admit that this community have helped me a lot to understand better betting and get some principals on my approach.
Also, thanks to u/JusticeWilson I have discovered fansunite which helped me to get some nice picks ;)

Whenever I have a Pick that I feel that is worthy to share, I will post it here. Keep in mind that my best sport is European Basketball (euroleague specifically), so that means that I will be posting mainly Thursday and Friday.

So without any further ado my record is available here - https://fansunite.com/profile/Drazen

*NBA Spurs @ Celtics*
I chose **Spurs -5 @1,9**. I think that the Cs are still trying to find out what should be their rotation and going 10 deep will come handy later on the season when fatigue will be much of a factor, but for this time of the season is not that important. It is mainly the individual performances that are winning games so far (Steph Curry scored 53 on a B2B game on the road!) rather than the team ones. Also, I expect that Spurs will try to build a good record this year that will give them the home advantage on the play offs (last year they lost it for one win and really cost them a lot). I am a little bit worried about how they will defend the central PnR with Isiah Thomas, but I wouldn`t be surprised I Greg Pop would assign Kawhi for a few minutes on IT in order to control the tempo.

My other pick for today was HOU +2, but w/o Dwight, I will pass on this.

Good luck gents and as Jalen Rose would say:
Keep gettin dem checks ;)

,"I visited America and the whole tipping set up is a shit show. 

I tried to do it right but I was told off a number of times for under tipping. I also dropped a few jaws by over-tipping and was advised of this by colleagues.  





Just charge the correct price and pay your fucking staff properly, how hard is it. And while your there calculate tax and display that fucking price on the shelf. 


Edit: Over a hundred people think I'm an idiot for not knowing how to tip, consider these scenarios:


I go to a bar, we sit for a bit, we dance for a bit, a waitress brings drinks, i get shots from the bar, two different bar girls bring us drinks. 
Who cops a tip?


How much do I tip the fuckhead in the bathroom for drying my hands and spraying nasty deodorant on me? 


A guy is standing at your hotel door with his hand out. 
Do I pay him per meter he dragged my bag or do I say ""I can carry that myself mate"" when I get out of the cab and shoulder charge him away from my bag?


I had two waitress?


How do I tip with the debit card machine?


This place is a bed and breakfast. I tip for bed, breakfast or both? 


The scenic helicopter flight guy is expecting a $80 tip?


Waitress spilled beer on my lap -5% of tip? She then rubs my crotch down with a towel....... firmly.....+15% of tip? My wife is not amused....... -7% of tip?


This is the fucked thing about Americans sometimes. 

When you call me ignorant it reads like this ""how can this be hard for anyone? I have done it my whole life""

I don't know if you saw my other comment, but I have a full-tuition scholarship and my university lets us use Master's classes to replace some of our upper level electives.

My PI is from Germany and has lots of connections with industry and labs there. 

That's what I'm thinking about the clinical and lab work...but I'm still waiting to get some more opinions before I make my decision. The coding is a good idea!

,"It is definitely interconnected... though I think the only event that would literally change lived experiences in places like North America would be nuclear war. Otherwise even a 'hasty' demise would take weeks to unfold before law and order completely broke down everywhere, and if I had to make an assertion, I'd say even given moderate shit-hitting-the-fan, the turbulent time period would probably take more like a year or five. Maybe ten. 

Environmental collapse doesn't happen overnight - it's a gradual addition of 'cumulative effects'. Hurricanes and earthquakes don't happen everywhere on the planet at the same time, and even volcanos spewing ash and whatnot will not have dramatic impacts all over the entire globe simultaneously. 

There's more support I think for an argument that an economic or social collapse would be much more widespread over a much shorter time frame, as indeed our economies and supply chains are interconnected. Most food in most places, for example, comes from elsewhere. So a social/economic collapse is more likely to happen over a few weeks but I also doubt that it would mean Mad Max everywhere immediately. Some places would feel like Mad Max already to me, right now. Other places will hold out for much longer. For example I have a hard time imagining Iceland turning into Mad Max just because the stock market crashes, the dollar gets dumped, and there's rioting in the streets in Europe and North America. 

So I think the only immediate instant global reset button over an hour or a day would be nuclear war. Otherwise it's varying degrees of collapse over months, years, and decades.

- **Germany**: 1 371 hrs / 58.3

- **France**:1 473 hrs / 59.5

- **UK**: 1 677 hrs / 48.5

- **Japan**: 1 729 hrs / 40.1

- **US**: 1 789 hrs / 64.1	

The number at the ends are the ""*GDP per hour worked, current prices, USD*"" to measure the productivity of one hour worked. As opposed to the stereotypes Germans don't work more than the British or the French (part time jobs or no jobs at all for mothers I believe is one of the main cause), and the French are the most productive after the Americans. Americans aren't the only developed country working that many hours. Still many countries in Europe work more hours: *Iceland, Ireland, Portugual*.

,"Most nuclear power plants, and virtually all civilian and military nuclear power plants, are really atrocious at making materials for nuclear bombs.

The reason is simple. For a bomb you want either highly enriched U-235 or highly enriched Pu-239.

Getting U-235 doesn't involve a nuclear power plant in any way. It is refined from naturally occurring isotopes. A difficult, power intensive process, since U-238 and U-235 are almost exactly identical except for a 1% difference in mass. 

Pu-239 is not naturally occurring, and so it must be bred from a reactor from U-238. This ends up being easier to do, once you have a proper nuclear power plant set up, plus its a better material for bombs, having a smaller critical mass.

***However***, when you breed Pu-239 from U-238, sometimes some Pu-240 is produced as well. And while you could potentially refine the Pu-240 from the fuel, its very much harder to do than refining U-235, due to the even smaller difference between the two isotopes. Only one AMU instead of three. A 0.4% difference in mass.

Now. The problem with your thesis. Most nuclear power plants, and indeed, virtually every single commercial and naval power plant in the US, are incapable of producing weapons grade plutonium because the fuel is left in too long. There is too much Pu-240 in the resulting waste, and the reactors are not designed for such short fuel cycles between refueling.

So how is Pu-239 produced? In specially designed weapons reactors, that are specifically designed to allow for the fuel to be changed out frequently. They pull the fuel assembly before too much Pu-240 is produced, and chemically separate the plutonium. Poof. They have weapons grade plutonium.

Commercial power plants are not, and never have been, used for weapons production, and are indeed awful at doing so(with some very small number of exceptions of power plants that were optimized for both power production and fissile fuel production).


And all of that is irrelevant, because of two simple facts.

Fact 1: U-235 has a half life of 700,000,000 years. Pu-239 has a half life of 25,000 years.

Fact 2: Neither the US nor Russia has detonated an atomic bomb since 1993, and only a handful of the bombs have been detonated by other countries.

Couple these facts together, and you'll understand that they do not have to make any more, because they already have far more than they need, and its not going anywhere. The bombs, i.e. the physical devices themselves, all the wires/circuits/explosives/etc can and do age, but the fissile materials in the cores degrade very slowly, and will still be useful for millions of years in the case of uranium, and hundreds to thousands in the case of plutonium. 

Some countries still want to make plutonium for bombs. NK, Iran. Some others, I'm sure. The rest? The US, Russia, EU, etc? Either already have all the bombs and fissile material they want or need, or have simply chosen not to pursue bombs at all as a matter of policy.

,"Not Russia, but I live in a former USSR country.

Although my country is in the EU and is getting more and more progressive, there are some leftover traits from the USSR times.

Alcoholism/alcohol consumption culture. Everybody is pressured in to drinking and if you say else-wise - you don't respect everybody else.

Back in the day it was either conscription or higher education. Even after the retraction of conscription, the parents of young adults considered them useless without ""an education"", so nowadays there are very few highschool graduates that didn't attempt to get into university, hence the lack of manual laborers.

Cursing using Slavic words is commonplace.

Some regions that had a lot of Russian citizens from job relocations refuse to speak the local language to this day.

Some of the holidays that were held in the USSR days are still unofficially celebrated and some traditions are still popular.

Shitty, old Ladas in the streets.

And probably the most notable - Racism. Back in the USSR, using blackface in 1960's movies was totally cool. Apart from the central Asian population, most people hadn't seen a non-white person with their own eyes. Most of their knowledge was limited. Even to this day young people still drop racial slurs like casual words, without hesitation. This is a trend in decline (at least in public), but you can still hear young, educated adults referring to black people as if they were primates, mocking them for no other reason than their looks.

Also, back in the day, shops were empty. Deficits of anything that was worth having. So anything that was any good was obtained through acquaintances. Jobs, inside-info on stock-ups, you name it. People that had access to anything good from factories, stores and such would hoard everything and resell to their friends. Even to this day it's hard to get a job here without having some one on the inside sticking their head out for you. I have an acquaintance that's an employee at a major retail chain in our country. She gets me and my girlfriend items that are on sale but don't even make it to the shelves because all of the employees. And all of the elderly still go to the stores 1 hour before opening like it's 1969. They shove and curse like there's no tomorrow and that pack of macaroni is the last in the universe.

And the worst thing - when we separated from the Soviet Union, we had more than 50 years of culture to consume in very little time. So the 90's-early 2000's were a cringe-fest of all western pop-culture mashed into one, ugly piece of shit. All of these talk shows discussing how awful these new things are.

The supply is indeed not regular but I think that has to do with the suppliers going to different servers everytime instead of staying on the same realm.",woweconomy,0,4,n01m4g1n4t10n,4,1446413626,1446413363,t1_cwks252,t5_2v9u2,cwktr0d,t3_3r2f5x,,1449535068,,0,
team 14,"&gt;CLG performed well

Did u watch the same worlds I did? Do we watch the same game at all? Sorry, but every single NA team at worlds was utter trash, there is just no getting around they. Yes C9 has an amazing first week, but it didn't take teams long to abuse how one dimensional they where. They is purely my own opinion, but I actually wouldn't say that CLG has gotten any better this year, it's just every other NA team that's gotten worse. NA was probably a bit better in season 4, but season 5 I'd bet that Roccat would have won the NA LCS. A team like TiP was probs about on the level of gambit pre forgiven ban, maybe not even. The NA from first seed at worlds was about as good as the Brazil first seed at worlds for crying out loud. NA has a bigstep to take if they still want to be considered a top tier region, and so far it looks like they have to do it through imports. I do not know the salary of NA vs EU, but I think another incentive could be that it's an easier league to make worlds from.",leagueoflegends,0,11,BrokenBiscuit,11,False,1446413439,t1_cwkpul8,t5_2rfxx,cwktsuo,t3_3r3nkf,,1449535092,,0,

If you had 1000 employees and 800 worked really productively but 200 skived off all day just reading reddit and playing solitaire.  There's a net economic benefit right, because the positive production of the employees that work outweighs the cost of the few that don't?

Suppose you ran a schools programme that took in 1000 C grade students.  You managed to get 70% of them to improve their grade to an A but 30% fell down to an D.  There is clearly a net benefit, so everything's okay with this system right?

,"I'm not sure Star Wars unified the aesthetic, at least not yet...and to take the counterpoint, I think that played a big part in why I find Sci-Fi more interesting and varied than fantasy (AS A RULE; I'm a fan of the Witcher books). A lot of fantasy is pretty married to some variation of the traditional dwarves and elves Tolkien tale at this point. We've reached the point that even attempts to diverge from traditional fantasy (see: Dzzit'ri or whatever his name is) are now kind of cliche too. The only fantasy stuff I'm into is stuff that's pretty well twisted into almost being another genre (Discworld has dwarves and such, but it's more satire than Tolkien; Game of Thrones has fantasy elements, but you often forget they're real and think it's just a medieval drama with sex and the occasional dragons, at least until much later on).

By contrast, I'd argue that Star Wars hasn't unified things to THAT kind of a degree. Pre-Star Wars franchises like Star Trek keeps things relatively diversified (although the newer Enterprise ships are less geometrical and more industrial), and some of the newer stuff, like Mass Effect, FTL, Out There and Transistor (okay, I'm having issues thinking of movies right now), still trend more in the directions of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Weird Sci Fi (Mass effect actually brings us the psychics that were once common to the genre and is called the Force in Star Wars).

But that's my take anyway. And I guess there's a degree to it. Do people call American Gods fantasy, since it is based more on religions than specific European pagan creatures?",movies,0,1,Theinternationalist,1,False,1446415017,t1_cwkerkg,t5_2qh3s,cwkuvzq,t3_3r2jq1,,1449535605,,0,

That's not much better, really. An act of deviance is something which differs from the norm, or otherwise has stigma attached to it.

I don't think you can really make either the case that over 50% of all people (especially globally, but also on a national level; locally may be quite different, depending on where you're based) cheat on their spouses, or that there is no stigma to cheating/cheating isn't viewed in a negative way.

In regards to the former aspect, I'm sure there's some Sociology article somewhere I could dig up which has probably tried (poorly) to study the prevalence of extra-marital affairs. As for stigma, it's as easy enough as looking at laws of various countries, as well as attitude surveys which have covered it (such as, I'm sure, the Atlas of European Values).

To give you the benefit of the doubt, you probably hold the view that it *shouldn't* be an act of deviance, whether it is or not, which is different since it represents an opinion rather than a social definition/fact.",todayilearned,0,5,Etular,5,1446415638,1446415336,t1_cwkulc1,t5_2qqjc,cwkv3kz,t3_3r229j,,1449535704,,0,

I mean, ffs, it's being  ordered ""on the direction of the president"" and assumes the UK wouldn't replace CAP subsidies with anything - which nobody is arguing for - ignoring that the UK currently pays £2 in the CAP budget for every £1 it receives.

Total fear-mongering that can be linked back to the Commission itself.

You can't just say David Cameron's government hasn't clarified his position on replacement agriculture subsidies on an exit and therefore we're going to assume all subsidies won't be replaced with anything at all - and then portray a doomsday scenario.

You've offered no evidence for this view at all. Not one lick.

&gt; You seem to fundamentally disagree with me although you don't provide reasons for why your view is plausible

The irony is here since you've offered nothing but your opinion that this is common sence without a single example.

&gt; think it's just common sense that you don't have to actually incite to have a chilling effect on speech, you can effectively intimidate people to silence without explicitly saying anything. 

You believe that people have a right to not be intimidated by specifically non-threatening ""hate speech""? You are talking about people choosing to be silent, for some non-specific fear of public ostracizing that is historically unfounded as best I can tell.

&gt;That's just not how ignoring someone or systematically belittling them worked when I've seen it happen to people around me. Think

You cannot make public opinion or ostrization go away through hate speech or any other. You as an adult human being will have to make *your own choices* as to what you say in public and people can treat you as they wish. Historically, its the people who say the hate speech that end up ostricized. Either way, it is, and should be legal. And frankly, ""hate speech"" cannot stop or meaningfully mitigate it.

&gt;Think people protesting and trying to intimidate people outside places that give abortions not to enter the premises even if they're there for completely different reasons.

Wow. Are you seriously saying you would outlaw protests of abortion clinics for the emotional well being of the women who go there. I'm pro-choice and I find that horrifying. No different than breaking the picket line for any other controversial protests.

&gt;I can see why you're trying to ""shut the whole thing down"" by saying ""that's not how it is. There is no give-and-take regarding free speech, more speech is freer speech"" rather than try to justify your views. That makes a lot of sense to me because I don't believe they stand up to scrutiny.

This is the deepest irony of your post. This is exactly what you are doing. You are saying ""how things are"" with nothing more than poorly founded opinions. You've not actually cited one single example of speech being prevented by non-threatening hate speech.

 &gt;""There is no give-and-take regarding free speech, more speech is freer speech""""

No my stance is free speech is freer speech. Your claim is that constrained ""Hate"" speech is freer speech and you've done nothing to support this view.

&gt;How speech works in practice is much more complicated, and more of a balancing act. It's much easier to find contentment with a simple solution that makes things very clearly black and white, good and bad.

Ugh. Can you offer nothing but strawmen and thinly veiled superiority? It's boring really. Particularly when the opinion seems founded in so little reading and evidence.

&gt; How speech works in practice is much more complicated, and more of a balancing act.

Demonstrate this. You've made the claim that there will be more freer speech when a government agency is the arbiter of free speech and limits ""hate speech"" at it's discretion. Show me this in action. You have all of europe to point to. Show me a European nation with greater free speech ""in practice"" with specific examples. People choosing to avoid public opinion backlashes has nothing to do with their actual freedom. And this cuts much more strongly toward offensive ""hate speech"" than the supposed victims of this speech.

&gt;Those are the kinds of over-simplifying solutions populism often relies because that's what we wish were true. It's not.

The irony, is that this is what you are offering. It was over-simplifying vapid populism that gave birth to hate speech laws. A government agency which oversimplifies speech as ""hate speech"" and outlaws it. Rather than allow free and open opinions and adults to choose their own actions. The fact that speech is complex is a wonderful reason why no government agency should be an arbiter of freedom of speech.

wa,"Yep, I've been playing hearthstone since the day it came out. I never played it too seriously, just played normals and sometimes ranked just to get ranked 20. About 6-7 months ago I started playing ranked a lot more seriously and was having a lot of fun trying to find innovative decks that could work. Currently that's impossible though, I was trying out some cool priest decks, a couple mage decks, etc... I could barely break rank 10 if I was getting lucky. I switch to secret paladin just to see how high I could get. I got to rank 1 literally in the same day that I switched the deck. The game has become so unbelievably broken it's not even funny. Everyone was complaining about grim patron warrior being op, but it honestly at least took some skill and a decent amount of things going right your way. Now you literally just try to empty your hand as fast as possible with secret paladin, refill it fully with divine favour, and repeat the process. There is no thinking required. I honestly just kind of got bored of playing the same deck over and over again because it was the only thing I could climb with. I'm not saying I'm some amazing pro who deserves to be legendary, but I definitely don't think that I'm bad enough to be rank 10 forever. 

Also I started an eu account just for fun... That didn't last too long. Turns out you literally can't play the game if you don't have ever expansion and a decent amount of cards. It's so unbelievably frustrating how terrible the base cards are. You literally cannot make an even somewhat playable deck. You have to get all the wings which will cost you a good 7k gold for the 2 expansions, plus cards from each of the 3 expansions. Must be fucking frustrating as hell for new players. The only reason I still play is ceuse there isn't really a good alternative for free in my opinion.

Debatable, but again, that's one of the messes with the US tax code.

How is taking money from one person by gunpoint to give to someone else civilized? I for one call that the opposite of civilization.

&gt; The tiny republic of Slovenia was the latest to give notice that it was considering a border fence, after more than 110,000 refugees and migrants streamed across its borders in two weeks.

&gt; Just a day later, Austria issued its own notice that it planned to throw up barriers along the border with Slovenia, although chancellor Werner Faymann insisted they would be to control the flow of refugees more effectively rather than stop anyone entering the country.

&gt; Police in the north of the country resorted to cramming shivering children into their vehicles to ward off disaster last week, but the number of refugees flooding into the country and the rapidly dropping temperatures make that only the most makeshift of solutions.

,"I won't say it's you talking out of your ass once context is put into place. I have a difference in the context than you however. I will totally say Faker didn't dominate at Worlds this year like S3. Even in Semi's and Finals he didn't. So yes, players who trying their damnedest to carry their teams like Niels (His team was so heavy, I feel bad for him) or Febiven (also very heavy team in semi's). I do think Faker played better than Piccaboo over all though and possibly Gorilla, I'm not sure how I feel on that statement though so don't quote it. Faker didn't have to try super hard, he was a role player for this Worlds. Put MaRin on a carry and let MaRin carry while Faker supported it, or put Faker on a carry champ and watch him murder shit, but he didn't always need to carry which is what If feel the two EU greats had to do for their teams. I also feel Faker got less assistance in terms of in game resources from his own team than those two got which is another thing to consider. 

In short, no Faker didn't play to the same level international fans in general likely expected, but he didn't to and likely shouldn't of. To play at that level of domination would typically require a hardcore play making champ or carry and Faker just didn't seem to be on that. 

I'm not saying you did this or do this in general, but people always seem to equate carrying with being the best. Sometimes the best guy for the team is the guy who just does what the team does and doesn't need to massively outplay everyone to do it. I think that's the thing, Faker was in the top 5 for me even pre semi's because he showed that he could totally hard carry if needed, but he just didn't need to instead he needed to support his top laner and to me that makes him stronger than the people who only know/are able to hard carry.

natsoc,"&gt;  you and /u/honorablejudgeholden are the same person with split personalities. You both have the same mannerisms and argue endlessly.

We're not the same person.  Chances are I would otherwise agree with him a great deal if it weren't for the fact that I absolutely under no circumstances support strengthening Islam in the current geo-political climate and I'm not inclined to support the left wing multiculturalist ""anti-imperialists"" who make up the vast majority of Israel's opposition.  During National Socialist Germany's time there were far far less Muslims in Europe and there was no left wing/neo-capitalist craze to import as many as possible to depress wages.  Hitler looked at two great Empires with respect in the fact that they projected unity and strength at the time: the British and the recently defunct Ottoman.  He wanted to help Germans achieve their own kind of Empire and ultimately would have preferred the British have worked with him than against them - Hitler never breaking his word to Aryan nations, leaving both Sweden and Ireland alone when they chose neutrality.

I try to discuss more than argue and really have only gotten into it with /u/Na7Soc here due to my intense dislike of the majority of the kinds of people who make up the ""anti-apartheid"" haters of Israel (BDS, International Solidarity, and the generally far-left fronts otherwise know as ""human rights"" groups) and his lack of a problem with them.  The anti-Israel crowd seems to mostly consist of leftist white self-haters who are projecting their hatred of successful white expansionism and cultural superiority onto Israel because Israel has received a large portion of backing from several white states - and it provided significant support to pre-ANC South Africa and Rhodesia when the rest of the west had abandoned their fellow whites in Africa due to leftist propaganda and loss of white racial identity.

Their hatred of Israel amounts to: ""Israel is an imperialist, colonialist, nationalist, patriarchal, racist, capitalist state"" - it is not based in a love of whites or a desire to prevent Jewish corruption of culture and morals or Jewish subversion in white countries which is why I'm generally indifferent to the fate of people like Rachael Corrie who decide to put on Islamic garb and travel half way across the world to a foreign country and a foreign conflict to show off how ""progressive"" they are.

orthodox,"So, there is a quote from the book, ""Religion and irreligion are cultural variables. Killing is a human constant.""

Humans kill. Sometimes, they kill because of their religion. Sometimes they kill in spite of their religion. Sometimes, they kill because they have no religion.

Yes, organized religion has done bad things, and still does. All that means is that humans are involved.

Governments do bad things. Even charities sometimes do bad things, even though they may be well meaning. Schools do bad things, and so do hospitals. People who choose not to identify with an organized religion do bad things, sometimes justifying themselves with their personal religions.

Organized religion does not cause people to do bad things, and it very often keeps people from doing bad things, by imposing an external morality on them that were they just ""lone wolf Christians"" they could have subconsciously twisted into what they want.

Organized religion also does plenty of good things. Organized religion, Christianity, in particular, started the first hospitals, provided charity to everyone, brought nobles to visit those suffering leprosy, eroded slavery in the Roman Empire drastically, to the point of forbidding it in Europe, improved the lot of women, enabled modern science, preserved the knowledge of the ancients as Europe fell into the Dark Ages, continues to this day to operate vast charities and hospitals and schools, &amp;c.

And it was able to do all these things precisely because it was organized. There was a structure there to manage and work and provide all of the things needed to improve the lot of billions of people throughout history.

Yes, organized religion has done some pretty shitty things, too. Mistakes have been made, because the Church, while divine, as the body of Christ, is also human. Outright sins and abuses have been committed. That happens, but it happens no matter what religion you are, organized or not, or even if you aren't religious at all.

Again, like I said, read the book. You might be surprised at what you learn.

Edit to add: in addition to all of the above, and more importantly, organized religion has spread the gospel more effectively and efficiently than any lone wolf could, *and* organized religion has held people accountable, to ensure that they are teaching what is true and helpful to salvation, so that false teachers can be found out sooner and not endanger the flock.",Christianity,0,8,superherowithnopower,8,False,1446423750,t1_cwky2ax,t5_2qh6c,cwl0bye,t3_3r4a7i,Southern Orthodox,1449538236,,0,

Assuming both of these sources are correct, that means men and women are equally likely to leave syria and go into neighboring middle eastern countries- however, a huge group of women must stop there and settle in those countries, while the ones continuing on into europe are mostly men. I have *no* idea why this is the case but i wish there was more information on this. it seems like a very odd demographic disparity. there has to be some cause for the numbers to be that different.

,"&gt; we still are in a recession.

To be in a recession there has to be economic contraction, there isn't GDP grew 4 % the second quarter of this year, job openings have risen significantly, the unemployment rate is consistently going down, corporate profits and stocks are through the roof.

&gt; Stop blaming bush when obama has had 8 years to work with republicans and has been the most divisive president in recent memory when he decided to spring obamacare on half the country that wanted nothing to do with it.


Bill Clinton was the most divisive President when he was in office and George Bush was the most divisive President when he was in office until most people acknowledged he was a shitty President. The fact that he's divisive says more about media coverage imo and it's not necessarily a bad thing. It's good to have healthy political debate on many issues, although I'd say the Republicans have poisoned the debate.

&gt; Go look at the bipartisanship before obama sprung obamacare on us.

Bi-partisanship is just a means to an end all you need to do is sign the bills, if one party were signing and passing through legislation that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing because they're elected officials too. Obstructionism is bad and it seems like the Republicans are addicted to it. Obama's first congress was the most productive since the LBJ era. 

&gt; spring obamacare on half the country that wanted nothing to do with it.

Most people did want healthcare reform and people are warming too it, fact is more people are insured now than before and it has about a 45 % approval rating that's growing and considering many who disapprove of the ACA say they want healthcare reform to go further I'd say that's a positive sign for Democrats in the future.

&gt; Stop blaming bush when obama has had 8 years to work wi

This is quite irritating and it seems like you don't understand the magnitude of the global recession caused by the Bush policies, Europe completely collapsed and many large countries are still in a complete mess, Obama doesn't get enough credit for averting the second great depression and in fact ""The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II."" I'd say that's a good record.

&gt; History will remember obama as a total bitch.

I think history will remember Obama as a consequential President who unfortunately had to live in Bush's world (who was a far more consequential President for worse reasons) he's been a good steward of the economy and has restored respect for US leadership around the world.

HumanBerserker,"Breaking it down:

Players can run through other players (except in PvP/WvW) but we're given the option to enable to disable passing through mobs while in combat (usually enabled by default so players don't run through whatever they're attacking, really helpful for close-range or melee characters). Mobs, on the other hand, have this on 24/7 (unless they've got a skill that lets them phase through other mobs, which is unlikely).

By pulling the Lich into the mini tomb he spawns from (or more specifically, into the tomb that's placed right behind the door he spawns from), the lich then seals up the doorway with his large body.

What this does is give the zerg unrivaled access to deal DPS without a meat shield, as his minions can't get past him from the outside, and whatever minions that were spawned within are easily dealt with by the AoE/cleaves from players' skills.

But personally, I'm all for skipping the lich if you don't have a zerg capable enough (which for me is nearly all the time, since 99% of the zergs I join have upscaled players leveling their characters quickly, which is to say, I play during the early mornings on EU servers).

,"Tokidoki &lt;A&gt; Ravencrest 6/13M recruiting!

Hello!

Tokidoki is a mythic raiding guild which strives to be the best it can be in every tier, achieving good progression in a stable and friendly environment. The guild was founded in 2011 and began raiding in Firelands. Over time we have built up a strong core of experienced raiders from all over Europe and are always open to finding new team members who fit with what we are looking for.

We made the jump with our core raid team from our old home of Auchindoun to Ravencrest in August 2015 in order to search for more players for Mythic progress.

We are currently recruiting an experienced DPS &amp; healer, but applicants who feel that they would be a good fit for our team will always be considered, so please feel free to get in touch if this sounds like it’s for you.

We raid for nine hours a week, Thursday, Sunday &amp; Monday from 19:30-22:30 server time. Invites start at 19:15 so we can be ready to pull at 19:30.

What we expect from you as a raider

You should have a positive attitude and be team spirited, thinking of others as well as yourself and working well together.
You are mature and motivated to raid, making as much effort as you can with what you bring to the raid.
You should know your class well, including any off specs.
You should be clued up on the relevant raiding content and be prepared for each new boss ahead of the raid.
You should be able to attend every raid. Obviously we understand that sometimes unexpected situations IRL may occur but we ask that you will communicate with us and let us know as much in advance as possible.
You need to be able to understand and communicate well in English on mumble during our raids. A working mic is required.
You accept that you are not solely in the raid to obtain loot, but because you enjoy raiding and want to down bosses as part of a team.
Your gear is fully gemmed and enchanted to the best level. You bring consumables with you to the raid.

In return for this we offer

Consumables for raids
Steady progression with a view to clearing the content
Weekly alt runs
A pleasant and friendly guild environment
A chance to meet like-minded people who also enjoy playing other games together outside of WoW, such as Minesweeper.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to add us for a chat in game. We look forward to hearing from you soon!

&gt; The Arabs were well aware of the [Balfour Declaration](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/balfour.html), and knew very well that the British had been appointed under the [British Mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine_%28legal_instrument%29) so that they could facilitate the mass immigration of European Jews who had been flooding into Palestine since 1933.

,"Eddie Jones ended his Japan HC career at the last day of this October. Here's an translation of most detailed summary of his last press interview as Japan HC, as follows:

Initial statement:

At my appointment press meeting, I stated that I wanted Japan rugby to take back its pride. Then how much it changed? The result is what you saw in this RWC, but we had much more than that. That's the way we played. We stack to Japan Way and showed what we were. I hope them keep it as a legacy and play no other way but Japan can do. They better not copy others, keep their own way. 

Rugby is a sport that relies on physical most. Physical differences are always with us. That's a reality. Japan is not big physically. We did Japan Way, best we could, to minimize it. By controlling paces and using skills, we fought wisely. 

Next RWC will be held in 2019 in Japan. 60% of current squad can possibly play there. From now, I hope them to go back their daily routines and never be bored to keep showing their Hard Work. 

I really enjoyed this four years. It's really good to complete my coaching term without being said to get out, in my 20 years of coaching profession. I have a lot of good memories in Japan. I do hope Japan rugby prosper. 

QAs:

Q: what's the point in Japan team to 2019?

A: Japan needs two elements to make results. One is finding talents and the other is coaching in long-term, structured way. Japan yet have a right system of coaching. It has to choose 30 prospective young players from 16 to 18 years old, gives them a right plan for fitness development. Then gives them enough experiences of world class competition. And keep doing all of these. 

To say honest, university rugby can't develop world class players. It is a kind of rugby being competitive only in Japan. What needed is development of elite players. New Zealand is competitive, why? It only has 4 million people and has a brilliant national team, why? Because they have a mind of developing players for their national team. Japan doesn't have the mind. They can't be in a knockout stage in '19 without acquiring that foundation. 

The reason why we did great jobs was that we had players with great talents. But they didn't become what they are now with plans. Planned developments have to be needed for their success in 2019. An example, we can't get numbers we want every time when we roll a dice. We might have gotten a number we wanted in 2015, but might not in 2019. We can get what we want when we made a plan, found talents, develop them systematically. 

Q: HC is important. Who do you think can succeed Eddie Way?

A: I think Japan wants Japanese coach. I would go overseas if I were a Japanese who wants to be Japan HC. I would seek experiences in the UK or France or other countries. And I would begin to learn English because rugby in the world uses English. Every Japanese coaches must do it all. Also a strong mind needed. 

Q: what's your intention about you having said the other day that there're someone in Japan who disliked changes?

A: My wife also dislikes changes (laugh). Japanese players can change. So the difference must be whether organizations can change or not. It is difficult and needs power to change these. Eventually, it depends on how many people think about Japan team as their own thing. We had great supports from corporate teams in this four years. But some universities refused to put their players to Japan team sometimes. 

Goroumaru was just a typical player in Top League four years ago. But now he's recognized in the world. Many teams want him to play with him. He changed his past set of mind by himself and wanted to be in the next level. But changing organizations is difficult thing. 

Q: how about Goroumaru playing overseas?

A: I'd say him to do it if he would ask me. Because he changed his mind and fitness. His success rate of kicking is 76%. It's his achievement and a proof that Japanese can change. And no nation look down on Japan at next RWC. 

Q: you mentioned two freshmen Fujita and Fukuoka as must-check. 

A: the best wings in this RWC were Yamada and Matsushima. Yamada can sense tides in matches. He's special in his university days but needed six years to mature. He became a player who moves great with a ball and makes efforts without it. I hope Fujita and Fukuoka need less time. They can show their strengths in university matches, but weakness never be revealed in test matches. Bright future will be waiting for them. And Matsushima did his best in this RWC. He always escapes first tackles and read games good. 

Q: About the last decision in RSA match?

A: I shouted to get three points to my headset at the time. But fortunately they didn't follow it. Captain Leitch is great. He's the person who knows what's going on on the ground. He represented the team at the moment. Captain leads his team. 

Q: what made the word Japan Way?

A: as to big football clubs or teams like New Zealand, anyone can easily state their characteristics once they heard their manes. Strong teams are like that. So I needed a solid word to state what Japan team about, that everyone can understand instantly. 

Q: you got that big achievement but why you leave?

A: l might has to stay when I think about some players who need development more. But I thought I could begin rugby at next level. I got excited when I had the offering. Staying in Japan isn't an easy thing as well. I decided to bring myself to another challenge and it's time to leave. But it doesn't mean I never come back here again. 

Q: what situations allow you to come back to Japan?

A: it's a good question. Honestly I yet think about it. A condition is that developments on talented players have been done. An example is that, Lock Ohno weighed 101 kg (223 lbs) four years ago. But that player can't compete in the world. He trained a lot and fought in this RWC at 109 kg (240 lbs). But these kind of trainings should not be done in a national team. These should be done in dedicated organizations. Canon team has a prospective Lock Usami. I wanted him to play test matches at 115 kg (254 lbs) next year, but his club team doesn't afford to make investment to future. So now national team have to take care of it. Developments like that need to be done thoroughly in Japan. 

Q: do you think Japan needs more fundamentals to accept differences?

A: there's an old saying in Japan that pile heads above an average must be leveled. I think it describes sports in Japan well. Everyone wants to be the same as others. But rugby requires players to show their own characteristics. I hope them to play with showing characters along with their characteristics. It would be sometimes difficult for them, as a Japanese, to complete that. Maybe it's because they take an education that recommends them to be followed. 

My squad looked at their feet at meetings in my first and second year. They didn't make an eye contact. They drifted their eyes not to take questions from me. But all of them look at me now. They used to have discussions. Sometimes rugby gets imagination from friction. Goroumaru was the case. He became the person who offers his opinions and tactics. That kind of exchanges helped the squad developed. 

Q: how does Japan has to change to RWC 2019 and Olympic 2020?

A: when I first came to Japan in 1996, there's no indication in English in stations. But now we have these anywhere. I live near the Chichibunomiya rugby stadium, Europeans walk around and they speak fluent Japanese. The world is changing. Japan don't need to face with it. But I think it needs to know the direction where it goes.

ROOT,"This has nothing to do with being 'foreigners', it upsets me so much when people are soooooooo quick to judge, you all reading this are foreigners, why aren't you Lilbow and do it better then?

I talked about this a lot in the article I published recently on Region Locking, but seriously speaking, from Lilbow's perspective:


He's one of the weakest players in the tournament, chances to win are prettttttty damn low to begin with. Pretty much every practice partner he could have already switched to LOTV, I know because helping hydra find practice was incredibly hard, thankfully Kelazhur kept playing Hots to help hydra out - and that's with us having access to the KR ladder with good ping (EU's ping is shit in comparison to what we got). Even then, FantaSy told hydra that everyone in KR ladder knew his barcode, so that made it even HARDER to prepare/practice for this. Again, that is hydra, who's arguably 'better' certainly more experienced and with a lot more access to practice than Lilbow (KR ladder from the ROOT house).

Lilbow is also the type of player who has 1 general style of play and excells with it because his execution is great, and that works with worse players than him, but when Life is the opponent and Life has had time to study and prepare for this in the KR ladder and at the KT Rolster house, you know with Zest and Stats no big deal, and then after that IF he somehow won it would only get harder?

I don't know, like I get it, that some people think foreigners are just lazy and shit but seriously if you can do better give it a shot, I haven't always been a fan of Lilbow, I used to think he was an arrogant douche - but I do know this: he's one of the hardest workers in the scene and that's how he got to be the best foreigner - the best player to emerge from a combination of factors and conditions (if you want to read more about that my article's on root-gaming.com). He looked at a situation maturely and made a decision to not prepare as much and instead transition to LOTV and invest into his 'future' he had already said before his goal was to win WCS and he did it, fucking props to him - no foreigner's ever done that before, no one has been able to emerge from the same conditions as him and do what he did. 

I am not saying that there isn't other people that would've tried harder or made a different decision, I am not saying that I would've done the same, because I like putting on a show, I like being the underdog - I'm sure we would've all handled it differently in his situation, but that doesn't mean that our way is any better or more reasonable than him, If this situation was a 'decision making' scoreboard at the end of a StarCraft game, I'd argue it's very likely he made the best decision in the longrun, because that base was probably gonna die anyway and committing resources to defend it just made no sense.

You want more powerful states and then use ""statist"" as an insult. And ignore the European Union.

The only things that state identity really means these days is what sports teams you support and what you eat at Thanksgiving.

,"&gt; Nope. The Free World is where people flee to when they want to be free.  Perhaps they are fleeing toward ISIS and we just don't realize this? Perhaps, got any evidence?

Not sure why you disagree here.  Of course people are fleeing from ISIS...ISIS faces massive security challenges.  They flee to places that don't have security challenges, where they can sleep without fear of getting raped or killed.  Places like Europe, i.e. the current refugee crisis.

&gt;You believe that they are totalitarian because of the USA's CIA? We disagree.

[edit: To be clear here, I'm ONLY using the CIA in the context of HUMINT.  You're lumping all the CIA's operations together and saying that the CIA can exploit disillusioned ISIS soldiers to form a terrorist/paramilitary unit that could topple ISIS.  I agree that's a possible tactic the CIA may employ, but that's not relevant to my HUMINT argument.]

&gt;Does the CIA have massive HUMINT inflows from within ISIS? First the CIA recruits the sex slaves that want to go home.

This doesn't make sense.  ISIS with their exceptionally tight population controls would surely know who fled and who returned, and would probably behead immediately anyone who fled.

&gt;Then the CIA recruits their fighters.

That's not really HUMINT as much as it is a form of terrorism, assuming that ISIS is a nation-state.

&gt;Imagine if the US was beheading and burning children. You are suggesting that many US troops would be silent and that few would attempt to flee?

They would not be welcomed back to the US, unless they had a death wish.

&gt;So, would you suggest that your thoughts on this are ""neutral""? 

""Neutral"" to my knowledge of how this sub works means ""substantiated with evidence"".  So, feel free to ask for any evidence for my claims.  I've made a lot of claims, so to back them up would probably take several times the amount of time of me typing this out.  A lot of it is historical, so I didn't want to spend too much time backing those up unless there was an actual disagreement with non-recent history.

Also, a lot of this ISIS stuff is going to be supposition of classified information from both of us, so supporting those claims is going to be very difficult.  We can only rely upon our reasoning for those claims.

,"I really liked Lazio last season so I can provide some tactical insight:

Piolo's main claim to fame comes from his 3-4-3 formation. Lazio had an excellent setup last year with Radu - De Vrij - Gentiletti in the backline. With Radu and De Vrij missing due to injury (De Vrij being a great defender while Radu being a great leader), Lazio have to play Mauricio and Gentiletti. Mauricio is a bigger fuck up than Zapata. Both don't complement each other.

In midfield, Biglia has just returned from injury and his main partner Parolo is missing with injury. Parolo is an excellent player, maybe the best box to box in Italy, and is an senior member in the squad.

Playing this formation allowed Basta and Lulic to play as wingbacks. They are pretty bad defensively and compensate by having tons of stamina and crossing ability. So they are exposed playing the in the 4-4-1-1 formation.

This setup also allowed Felipe Anderson and Candreva to play solely up the pitch and not have to cover for their fullbacks. This was the problem today as Felipe Anderson and Candreva had to go back and run all over the field to get the ball.

It's a combination of injuries and unfamiliar tactics that have led to Lazio's demise this season. Doesn't bode well for Europe.",ACMilan,0,4,IsIndianStereotype,4,1446437082,1446436889,t1_cwkuwcd,t5_2rnmt,cwl8kov,t3_3r4o84,Abate,1449542125,,0,

It would be best to find programs that interest you and then email them and ask about international students - how many are in the department currently, are there funding differences (i.e. international students are often not eligible for a lot of the extra funding available for US students).

,"What tarnishes the brand is locals hijacking it thinking it will help their business then being a shitty business. Regardless I can't count the number of times I've seen American this or American that and it have nothing to do with actual American companies. Most technology out of Japan comes from elsewhere but is improved in Japan, like cars, TVs, toilets, etc. German nor Japanese tech helped them much in WW2. South Korea can in many ways thank the US for their recent economy boom (and their freedom from communism) along with the Vietnamese. (Communism would have obstructed a market economy.) America = brand value and business owners in third world countries want to reap that for all it's worth. If you look at product development trends in South Korea and Japan you'll notice somewhat of a creativity gap and lack of true innovation. Even video games and anime borrow themes from Norse mythology and old Japanese tales. This can be attributed to collectivist societies where individual thought and self expression is suppressed from an early age, unlike an individualist society like in America. East Asian countries with developed economies (Japan &amp; South Korea) are really good at taking ideas and improving on them (like better LCD panels in TVs or heated toilet seats that open and close by themselves). They didn't invent computers or discover airplanes. Germany is known for advanced manufacturing processes and modern machinery. Still the list of inventions/contributions to the world of the countries you mentioned would be dwarfed by that of the United States. People deny it all the time because of their own national pride, but the evidence is quite clear. Melting pot of cultures/ideas + freedom+ capitalism/free market economy leads to product and process innovations.

,"King redesigned their line in the 1990s (the mello and bari, at least), and the contra was again redesigned in the mid-2000s. 

As far as three-valve bugles go, Kanstul had their initial line from 1990 to about 1994 or so. The addition in 1994 of the ""tune-any-note"" slides necessarily changed the routing of the tubing, so they took the chance to redesign the bugles. You can see the original sopranos and mellos in 1991 SCV and 1991-1993 CBC, and the tune-any-note sopranos, mellos, and baris in SCV 1995.

Dynasty, however, started making three-valve bugles around the mid-80s for European corps, and the baris and euphs were basically the two-valve models with a third valve almost literally tacked-on. The mellos and sopranos, however, were new designs not based on the two-valvers. At some point, probably during the late 1990s, Dynasty decided to change their lineup to look more like Kanstul's, and added a ""tune-any-note"" kicker to the soprano, completely overhauled the bari and euph, and curved the third valve slide of the mello.

The Dynasty contras are really interesting because they're basically unchanged from the two-valve era except for the third (and in some cases, fourth) valve. Dynasty made two models of contra in the 80s - the regular and the Super Mag. The Super Mag came later, and I think it replaced the regular model at some point, but both of those, once three-valve came along, had the third valve tacked-on in the same manner as the baris and euphs. In the late 1990s, a four-valve Super Mag was available, but now Dynasty only has the three-valve regular model for sale. This model has the exact same tubing wrap and the same design as the one first introduced in around 1979, save for the third valve.",drumcorps,0,3,Karinta,3,False,1446440706,t3_3r4ty3,t5_2rwjm,cwlara8,t3_3r4ty3,G mello bugle pilot | SCVC '16 hopeful,1449543154,,0,

,"The Gulf States would be fairly hostile to a coup, they are also Islamic fundamentalists, and while they don't see eye to eye on everything, they would rather have Erdogan than secularists. Turkish and Saudi policies align fairly well on this point currently, and while a neo-ottoman army government may be just as willing to stay on the anti-assad bandwagon, they can't possibly be more commited than Erdogan. 

It would need to depend on the circumstances. You can count on Egypt and Israel to be supportive of a coup, though neither country would facilitate it. The Egyptian military government would love to see a Turkish military government, even though a Turkish coup would probably end in an election. It would legitimize their rule, and ties between Erdogan and the Muslim Brotherhood (which is being rapidly re-radicalized and re-militarized by the crackdown) have long been suspected, though I am unsure how deep they are. You may be able to put the Jordanian monarchy in this category as well. They are not happy with Assad, but they give just enough aid to keep the Southern Front alive, not enough to topple him. They want the war over to alleviate the strain it has put on their military and society, which already suffers from its involvement in the Israel-Palestine conflict. The Jordanian monarchy has proven its strength over the last four years, I would have never guessed they would be able to house a two to four million refugees of different ethnic groups, fight terrorists, and police a border with a failed state, but they've held the country together so far. But they need an end to the war soon, or we may begin to see cracks. A Turkey under a military government may be more willing to negotiate, something the Jordanians must be open to.  

The U.S. and EU would be highly context dependent, as would Russia. If Erdogan steps up his authoritarianism in a bad way, pushes things in Syria too far, and starts putting Kurds in camps, they may be willing to stand aside for a military coup, like how Obama reinstated weapons shipments to Egypt after the military overthrew the government there. They would actually probably be more supportive in Turkey than in Egypt, Turkey is more important strategically, and the military in Turkey has always been fairly friendly towards the United States, though Erdogan has also been friendly, more than is normal for Islamic presidents. He seems to be tilting more towards the US after flirting with Russia briefly, possibly out of fear of losing US support. 
 The Islamic factions in Turkey also seem more willing to work within the democratic structures than the MB. Unless the Army cracks down very hard, the prospect of the AKP radicalizing like the MB is more remote. After the last coup, for example, the Welfare Party simply changed its name to the Virtue Party (later the AKP) and re entered politics. Unless the army miscalculates, they can probably get away with a coup without too much violence from Islamists. They also don't have ungoverned areas like the Siani that militants can hide in. The areas outside government control would be Kurdish areas, and they wouldn't shelter an Islamic movement. The US presidential elections will also have their own impact. Hillary and all the Republicans are more hawkish than Obama. Of course, no one has addressed this in any detail, so it is hard to tell what their reactions would be. But they would likely all be more willing to seize an opprotunity than Obama. The EU position would likely be similar, but it would depend on the country. Germany, Italy, and France appear to be the main players within the EU on this issue. Their primary interest is in ending the war and stopping the refugees, but Germany dislikes coups. They also are still not comfortable with Assad, and have well founded doubts about there being any sort of long term peace, even if he only actually remains in control of a rump state. Realistically, Turkey is a very tricky problem for the West. If there is a coup, the Islamists will blame it on the US and they will further alienate the man in the street, who is already anti-American and anti-west. If there is no coup, the US and EU will be accused of failing to take action when/if Erdogan hits the Kurds and doesn't hit IS. Very few good options here for the First World. 

Russia would almost certainly support a coup, although they would also not facilitate one. Erdogan has turned very harsh towards Russia recently, as Russia has stepped up involvement in Syria. A new government in Turkey can hardly make things worse for relations. And while the Army may have its own neo-ottomans who are resentful of Russia and actively hostile towards it, the Russians may see them as being more willing to negotiate. They likely see the army as more rational than Erdogan. Not to say that Erdogan is irrational, his strategy of fanning the flames of the War for political gain was a good move that has evidently paid off. But he is less likely to negotiate a mutually acceptable deal than the Army. An agreement where the Turks stop arming rebels but gets a free hand in Kurdish and Turkmen areas in the North could be possible, for example. But again, this is all highly context dependent. 

Iran would likely be similar to Russia. Interestingly, most Iranian rhetoric seems to be aimed at the GCC, rather than Turkey. The Iranians support Assad, and Erdogan and much of the Army want him gone. But it seems to me that if there is one area where the Iranians will be willing to negotiate, it is Northern Syria. Assad is never going to reestablish rule there any ways, not with the Kurds sitting there with US backing. They are very commited to keeping Assad in charge along the Coast and in the South, but I can't believe that they are that interested (relatively) in the North, an area dominated by Kurds (not Saudi aligned factions or sunni extremists) and so unlikely to be useful to either side in the Sunni-Shia Cold War. The Turks also have limited interests in Iraq, once again mainly limited to the Kurdish dominated North. The Iranian interests lie in the South, in the Shia areas where they wish to extend their power and prevent the Saudis from influencing Baghdad. Iraq is a secondary front in the Cold War relative to Syria, but it is the closest one to Iran. Therefore, Turkish and Iranian interests are not perfectly aligned, but they do not seem to be locked into the same sort of deadlock game we see with SA and Iran. 

There doesn't really need to be foreign support for coups to succeed when a large enough portion of the population is unhappy with the present government. ",geopolitics,0,14,darthpizza,14,1446443760,1446442113,t1_cwlaasc,t5_2qhnn,cwlbhue,t3_3r5nyk,,1449543501,,0,

I think it will be very interesting to see what happens as we continue forward in the information age. Cultures simply won't survive in a terribly recognizable form. The internet has been a catalyst for cultural exchange, accelerating it tremendously. Once China, India, Brazil, and some of the other up and coming big names get their infrastructure up to par, that could do some interesting things, I feel. Many Europeans are already bi-lingual. I game with them all the time. With better infrastructure, we can also assume there is better education, and with those two combined we'll likely see a new generation of tech savvy bi-lingual people. That would vastly change the landscape of the internet in probably 2 generations. That's hundreds of millions of people sharing ideas.

The fact is, as we globalize, no culture will survive in any meaningful way. There will be no north American culture, no south American culture, no European culture, no Asian culture. Regardless of what cultural appropriation takes place in this century, by the 2150's, the culture that appropriated the word/item/practice will be gone. It will all be blurred and blended as there becomes only humanity. This is just a fact of nature, a natural occurrence in human discourse, and I don't see much point in fighting it. Personally, I look forward to it. This is new territory we're treading.",changemyview,0,1,ARogueTrader,1,False,1446442904,t1_cwlaqoe,t5_2w2s8,cwlbvrg,t3_3r4ejr,1∆,1449543684,,0,

,"Everything is an artificial construction at some point. Yet, some construction are more artificial than others. Some nation share a language, a space, and whether we like it or not have been taught their nation's history etc. There is no such thing in the EU. Moreover, before the recent explosion of transports from the last 40 years, the people barely moved, so you have some roots and some of your parents that lived there, for some hundreds years. The only thing that we share in the EU are some boundaries. We are supposed to share a wish for solidarity, unity etc. but this is all void speech and this is coming to light right now, as the european treaty already implied.

Singapore is a very special country, I doubt its history as a nation is very old next to such big countries but I may be mistaken. Furthermore, they advertised themselves as a very liberal country, willing to accept workers etc. so all nations are not equal. No one, is preventing people from going in or out. But some people may like some values of their countries, and that's exactly my case for France. I like its culture, I like the people, I like its food, I like its geography, I have my friend there, my parents, and the parents of my parents etc. lived there, my grand father work at the ""Chantier Naval"" in Nantes building boats, I like its history of revolution, I like some of its institution. Those people have some conscious and I just started to realize this as I'm in New Zealand where the culture is anglo-saxon (like the people dont even care about the TTP or may not know what it is), full of concrete, no architecture, no history, etc. well they have some nice landscape but it just does not cut it.

europe,"The short answer is that Austria-Hungary was looking to establish itself as the hegemonic power in the Balkans. I'm sure you're familiar with the term ""sphere of interest,"" and it would be accurate to describe Austria-Hungary's goal in the Balkans as such. In 1866, Austria-Hungary is defeated by both the Germans in the Austro-Prussian War and the Italians in what is called the Third War of Independence. Both of these defeats are serious blows to Austria-Hungary's Great Power status. Essentially, Austria is booted out of a position of influence vis-a-vis the soon-to-be unified Germany and Austria-Hungary's Italian possessions, including Venetia, is ceded to the Italians. Basically, Austria-Hungary is seen to be weak militarily and sees its powerful position in Central Europe taken by the Germans.

As a result, many Austro-Hungarian policy-makers decide that Austria's only area for expansion, and thus ability to regain its lost Great Power status, is in the Balkans. The Ottoman Empire is perceived as weak and dying (I've written about the pitfalls of ""decline and fall"" narratives before, so be careful here) and its possession of much of the Balkans is seen as tenuous at best. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, Ottoman Turkey cedes almost all of its European possessions. Romania, Bulgaria and Serbia all establish themselves as independent kingdoms. The province of Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, though occupied by Austro-Hungarian troops, remains under the titular control of the Ottoman Empire.

The countries that establish themselves in the wake of the Ottoman defeat are very important to the story of Austria-Hungary. Remember, the Balkans are where the Austrians are going to regain their pride and lost Great Power status. They want to establish themselves as the regional hegemonic power. What would that look like? Well, all the land not controlled directly by Austria-Hungary would be held by countries friendly to the Austrians in terms of trade, military affairs and diplomacy. Much of the time between 1878 and, say, 1908 is spent trying to win these new countries over to Austria-Hungary.

Austria trying to establish itself as the big guy on the block on the Balkans necessarily brought it into contact with Tsarist Russia, which, consequently, was also trying to establish itself as the big guy on the block in the Balkans. Russia wanted to be the protector of the new countries, especially Serbia. Russia, similar to Austria-Hungary, had lost its Russo-Japanese War with the Japanese in 1904/5 and saw the Balkans as *its* new area for expansion and influence.

Austria-Hungary and Russia actually have a pretty comfortable relationship, even in the Balkans, until 1908, when Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count Alois Lexa von Aerenthal pulls a fast one over on the Russians and their Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alexander Izvolskii. Remember when I said earlier that Austria-Hungary had occupied but not annexed Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina in 1878? Well now, Aerenthal decided he would go to the Russians and ask them if they'd be willing to support Austria's annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Austria-Hungary and Russia, remember, were kind of cooperating, or at least tolerating, each other's interests in the Balkans. Well Izvolskii and Russia, despite the fact that their little brothers, the Serbs, had designs on Bosnia, allegedly give Aerenthal and Austria-Hungary the go ahead to annex Bosnia (make it a full and legal province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) as long as Austria would support Russia in its attempt to lay claim to Constantinople and control of the Bosphorus Strait. I say *allegedly* because Aerenthal and Izvolskii's meeting was very secret and private and no minutes of the meeting survive. After the meeting, Austria annexes Bosnia but then fails to help Russia take the Bosphorus; this makes Russia look weak to the rest of the world, since it's well known that Russia is also looking at the Balkans as their special little area of interest. From this point on, 1908 to 1914, Austria-Hungary and Russia's relationship deteriorates.

So now Austria-Hungary is on Russia's bad side. Meanwhile, the king of Serbia, Alexander I Obrenovic, is assassinated in 1903. His dynasty had been pretty friendly with Austria-Hungary, but the new king, Peter I Karageorgovic, is decidedly anti-Austrian. The Serbs were a new nation in Europe, having becoming independent in 1889 (see above) but many Serbs were still living under Austrian rule in various Austrian provinces: in Croatia, in Hungary,  and, since 1908, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina. The annexation of Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina *really pisses off* the Serbs. They see Bosnia as Serbian land and, like the Russians, are incredibly upset when Austria annexes it. Three years later, in 1911, Serbia teams up with Greece, Romania and Bulgaria to attack the Ottoman Empire, since the Ottomans still have some European possessions. The Balkan League, as it was called, manages to defeat Turkey and push  them out of the Balkans. Bulgaria gets a ton of new territory as a result. The other members of the Balkan League get jealous and in 1912, *they* team up and turn on Bulgaria. During this Second Balkan War, two Austro-Hungarian corps mobilize in a show of force against the Serbs. The Serbs ignore the threat of Austro-Hungarian intervention, aimed at intimidating the Serbs and keeping them from making territorial gains and coastal territory. Serbia wins. These two Balkan Wars end with Serbia looking strong and poised to be a regional power in the Balkans, challenging the hegemony of Austria-Hungary. Importantly, remember, Serbia is also tied to Russia. The rivalry with Serbia as a new upstart in the Balkans provides the context for the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, with which I'm sure you're familiar. The rivalry with Russia for influence in the Balkans provides the context for the assassination of the Archduke sparking a general European War instead of simply a Third Balkan War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia.

As a side note, Aerenthal and other Monarchists saw foreign policy as vital to Austria-Hungary's future. The Empire was a hodgepodge collection of over 11 ethnic groups, and the domestic political situation seemed stagnant to many contemporaries. There was a coterie of diplomats and soldiers in the upper echelons of Austria's decision-making circles who felt that foreign policy was a good avenue to sort of divert attention away from stagnant internal politics. Conrad von Hotzendorf, who would famously lead Austria-Hungary's troops in battle in 1914, many times suggested preventative attacks (preemptive strikes) against Italy and Serbia.

As one final note, Alison Frank at Yale is working on a new book about Austria-Hungary's imperial ambitions prior to the First World War, so if this topic interests you, look for that to come out soon. I gave you the short and dirty version of the story, so if you're unclear about any of the parts (some of them are rather confusing) or would like book recommendations on the topic, please don't hesitate to ask. I think it's awesome that you're looking into this period and Austria-Hungary specifically, and I'd like to help.

**TL;DR** - having been defeated in 1866 and not possessing any overseas colonies, Austria-Hungary needs a place to expand and exert its imperial influence. The Balkans are seen as fertile ground, but Russia and a new Serbia stand in Austria-Hungary's way.

,"I have figured some things out to help myself get better at this.

1. Banish anxiety. If you're super worried about following the speaker, the words won't stick in your mind. Do your best to maintain a relaxed, but focused, mental state. One thing that helps here -- when you're sitting in a lecture or meeting, make sure you're breathing. Your brain needs the oxygen!

2. Game-ify your active listening. I'm quite visual, so I create images of what the person's talking about. For example, if the professor is describing relations between two European nations, I might picture them as people with cartoon-like outfits or characteristics. 

3. If you can, take notes. Write down key sentences instead of trying to copy down the lecture word for word. Use numbered lists, if you feel like it, to organize thoughts as they come. You can keep doing this throughout your career -- people take notes in meetings all the time!

4. If it's a small enough group, you can raise your hand and say, ""I'd just like to make sure I understand what you're saying..."" Then, briefly (3 sentences) summarize what you think the professor is saying. it's a great way to learn more actively, and as long as you're not rambling, this one can fly in the professional world, too. Over time, you'll find yourself doing this in your head automatically, and you won't always feel like you need to verbalize it aloud. 

5. This is a quirky one, but start paying attention to *how* language is used by speakers. Take note, mentally, of when they repeat constructions (e.g. ""We choose to go to the moon...""), emphasize words, change tone, speed up or slow down. ""Hearing between the lines"" in this way can help you catch and respond to the key points instead of hearing one long, unbroken stream of words.

,"exactly. He's arguing as if every base is a Ramstein, and ready to destroy whatever country it's tasked to destroy, and that's just not the case at all. Majority of the bases are simply logistics and communications hubs, that allow the US military to do what it does. Hell, majority of those bases, serve not only the US, but large chunks of the global military powers. For instance, NSA Naples serves not only the US Navy, but also the Italian, French, British, German, Dutch, etc. They're all helped by it. The comms out of NAS Sigonella aren't *just* for US ships/aircraft. During Unified Protector for example, 90% of the aircraft I was working with out of NAS Sigonella weren't even US aircraft. They were Turkish/French/Dutch/Swedish/UAE/etc.

We could probably cut down on bases like the Army installations in Germany, but even those would be hard to do, as the German government begged us to come back, the infrastructure already exists, and they serve double purposes. Not only are bases like Stuggart army staging areas, but they're also massive medical hubs. A person injured in Iraq gets stabilized in Iraq, but then sent to Germany for intensive care. It's far closer than the US, and it's in friendly territory, where you're not putting the patient's life at risk of cross fire. Also, they're the main DoD telcomm hub. Most internet and data feeds to posts in Europe and the Middle East all go to Germany, where they're broken down to their particular post. When my long haul comms went down, I'd have to call DISA Europe, out of, you guessed it, Germany. WIthout them, we'd have to have hundreds of private connections for each post, including embassies, from the US. Instead, we get a couple massive bandwidth cables from the US, send them to Germany, and then use small cables locally to send the data where it needs to go.

It's not as simple as it seems, and the logistics aspect of it, is why the US is the unparalleled military leader in the world.

,"I like you and I like your posts, so don't take my disagreement personally. 

You say ""concern number one is always economic"", when there _is_ certainly a problem with global economic crises that are manufactured and always tend to benefit the elite - the two number one concerns are 1.) That our global life support systems are slowly failing because of 2.) Our addiction to fossil fuel and carbon-based energy. The economy collapsing would be significantly problematic, but nothing else matters if the Earth cannot sustain life. 

Refugees in Europe ... humans might be able to be hosted in those countries, sure. But culturally, economically, and in terms of food and materiel necessary to support life, Europe is already stretched, and pushing stressed-out, potentially militant refugees into other people's houses (look it up - Germans are getting kicked out of their apartments to house refugees. How will that go over do you think?)... I think your idea that Europe's ""liberalizing influence"" will benefit people could be true, but not if instead people get scared and start walling up - literally or figuratively. 

Peak oil _is_ a huge problem. Fossil fuels power modern society and nothing we can do will replace that in the near term. Electric cars need a power source, so in a global-energy-requirements-point-of-view, they're irrelevant. The big problem is energy return on energy investment; if it takes more oil to get the oil out of the ground than you get, then plenty of oil in the ground will stay there. The EROEI of the Tar Sands, for example, is between 3-5:1 and that's terrible. 

Lab grown meat? OK, maybe. But self-driving cars? We'd need to make enough to replace *ALL* the cars currently on the road and AT BEST we'd save 1.3 million people a year from death and ~55 million from various injuries. Maybe. Pedestrians might still get killed, and I'm not convinced that self-driving cars would _guarantee_ 100% reduction in disease burden. But yes, it might lower the disease burden associated with driving cars. But we'd need to make millions and millions of them and we don't have the economic structure, energy, or materiel to do all that. And I'm not sure what difference it would make with respect to everything else we were talking about to save those people - especially if part of the problem is overpopulation. Health breakthroughs? Maybe, but keep in mind that diabesity (the WHO term, not mine) and cardiovascular diseases in general are _diseases of Western civilization_. By many accounts they're getting worse because of modern society, not better. Medication doesn't tend to _prevent_ disease, but _treat_ it. And, the older people can get, the more people we have for longer who need energy, food, water, and so forth. Where are all the labs for your lab grown meat? What guarantee can you make to us that this synthetic meat wouldn't cause some other medical problem? 

You go on to say that Environmental Damage is the most serious threat but earlier you've already said that the ""1. concern number one is always economic""... is it the former, or the latter? What technology is being developed to mitigate all environmental problems? Where can you point to us having the know-how, wherewithal, materiel, and energy to do geoengineering without causing some other series of externalities/unintended consequences? The rest of your post seems to focus on how 'new tech' will save us. I laugh a little bit over the ""history has a proven track record of increasingly impressive developments""... ? Really? You bring up fusion, which we're not capable of doing; then quantum computing, which we're not capable of doing (or aren't doing at least), or really _doing anything with_ CERN other than taking measurements and doing purely theoretical physics... We don't have a space elevator. We can't build a space elevator. What benefit would we have to mine asteroids? We don't have the _energy_ for that. We don't _need_ that shit. 

You know, maybe I agree with your last couple sentences, sort of. If we can make it 50 more years, it'll _only be because we've managed to pull a rabbit out of the hat_. It'll be because we start churning out LENR or LFTR reactors by thousands a year and start en masse turning off coal powered plants, pulling carbon out of the atmosphere and burying it as some synthetic compound with nuclear energy, and finding a completely new way to manage resources, each other, and governance... Otherwise, we're dead. 

We haven't got time to fuck around. The techno-fantasy you're proposing is tempting to want to buy in to. But, we don't agree there's a problem. We don't agree what we'd do about that problem(s). We don't have the political will, economic ability, energy, or materiel to go build magic boxes, whether they're LENRs or LFTRs or whatever else. Whatever magical boxes you're talking about. We don't tend to distribute this magical technology evenly and that doesn't matter so much when we're selling plasma TVs, but in terms of sustainability we need the whole world rowing in the same direction. Conflicts can arise from a number of factors obviously, but if we had magical green-grass, fresh-water, and clean-air boxes, and we kept them for ourselves, that'd spark major conflict. If society collapses economically or socially before you can geoengineer and infinite energy ourselves into a futuristic utopia, then you don't have the supply chain, human resources, or framework and infrastructure to roll out your technosolutions before they're fully operational. They also need all of those things to stay working. And we're in increasingly perilous positions. 

Overall I just find it head-shakingly annoying that you make a number of foregone conclusions about how we're going to improve our health and lives with magical new technology, but that you're ignoring that we cannot really get there under current conditions (peak oil, peak economy, peak copper, peak fresh water, etc.) All the things we need to exist are in decline. All the things we need to build your magical future-boxes are in decline. And, there are 100+ million US citizens who would argue with you over the very existence of ""global warming"", and they'll call you a ""warmist"" and vote for some dickhead who will go drop a bomb on some brown guy who we never had a problem with before dickhead got in the seat, fire all the scientists, and get into another few brushwars. 'Murica. 

You're also ignoring runaway feedback loops. You're ignoring the fact that we need a healthy environment to exist. We can adapt - wear coats, get air filters, grow food in our bunkers with aquaponics - but we cannot support 7+ billion people like that. We can't build controlled-environment greenhouses over _all the arable land that we just destroyed by messing with the climate too much_. You are placing an awful lot of faith in large, profit-driven institutions (big pharma for example) and discounting the resistance that is offered by other big interests (big oil for example), to make effective changes. 

Change won't come from magic boxes. It isn't going to come from solar panels, wind turbines, or making us live 'more efficiently'. The money/market paradigm, fossil fuel energy, the surveillance state, the wag-the-dog media, military-industrial-corporate-plutocrat rule... we need to get rid of that stuff to socially evolve. We need to socially evolve before we're going to be able to do anything effective that _would_ enable humanity to have a dignified existence for centuries longer. Right now, I don't see it happening without significant pain. I hope I'm wrong. But I hope you're wrong too - because if nothing with respect to our sociopolitical organization changes, all the infinite energy and super-healthy synthetic meat won't stop other social and environmental injustices from happening, nor can we reverse the ecocide we've already committed. The worse the ecocide gets, the less chance we have to survive.

16,"&gt; I just thought it was interesting that someone like Kahn or Maier were behind Neuer

Not really surprising. He won the treble, won the world cup, playing every minute of both tournaments and being an essential player. He came in 3rd for Ballon D'Or, was named World Goal keeper of the year twice. He's credited by pundits and peers for having brought goalkeeping to another level. Achieved all that by the age of 28. He's kept breaking almost all historical Bundesliga goalkeeping records for the past couple of years. Most clean sheets in a season, least goals conceded in a season, most clean sheets per game played and least goals conceded per game played looking at the entire career. Of those who played more than 100 matches, he's actually the only keeper to concede less than one goal per game over his career (0.81 per game), and that includes his Schalke games. He was even the only one to concede less than one goal per game if you only count the Schalke games.

It's not just the Bayern defense. After Kahn retired, Bayern's defense was the laughing stock of Europe from 2008 to 2011. When Neuer came on in summer 2011, the number of goals conceded a season went down from 42/31/40 to 22/18/23/18. First season he played for Bayern he broke the Kahn record and Bayern went over 1100 minutes without conceding. He's quite arguably the best goalkeeper in Bundesliga history, and as such I don't see why he shouldn't be there.

what makes frankfurt better to bet on than online games? i personally do poorly during lans. ive lost overall on every single lan since DAC. i know this so i bet very conservatively during lans and ultimately just bet for action so i can have a little fun watching games. i make most of my winnings from online EU/SEA games and soccer. frankfurt being a huge tournament doesnt guarantee that you'll end up winning.

everyone (even 'good' bettors) loses everything in the end? if youre a winning bettor long term whos bets are +EV and with proper bankroll management then you will win in the long run no questions asked. take this for an example: if i told you that you could bet $10 and win $15 if you bet heads on a coinflip, would you stop betting if tails came out 55/60 times? definitely not cause the bet itself is +EV, but you would probably decrease your bet size relative to the decrease in your bankroll",Dota2Betting,0,3,nevermindthebbb,3,False,1446453945,t1_cwlevjy,t5_2xnuo,cwlfdnu,t3_3r6n3i,,1449545338,,0,

,"People tend to think socialism was just pure bad, but many would argue that that world was better in many ways. This applies to most ""satellite states"" (Eastern Europe), but maybe less to the USSR itself where everything was way more serious. Many people tend to say that life was better in general during socialism, for these reasons:

* Everyone had a job, and you could not lose your job

* Everyone had money to live a regular life

* There were no homeless or poor people

* The price of everything was low and did not go up over time

* Life was simple, there was no competition, so no stress in not being ""good enough"" like today

* Work was easy, since you could not lose your job it was acceptable to slack off

* Money was not important - everyone had the same pay and the price of everything was adjusted to that, so you just bought what you needed. There was no need to put money aside or to fear expensive things.

* The world was not ruled by rich people or corporations out of interest. It was ruled by the government alone.

But then the disadvantages:

* Lack of freedom - this is probably what pissed people off the most. People will fight for freedom at any cost

*  Could not leave your country, could not buy things from other countries because foreign currency was non-exchangable

* Could not earn more money than the average person

* No variety in commodities - you had one kind of bread, a handful types of cars that all looked the same, one kind of record player, one kind of underwear. There was rarely even a choice of color or size.

* The system was unsustainable, there was no way it would not collapse sooner or later economically. This was because the work and goods that people would produce would not match the cost of that work, since it didn't matter

* [Edit] There were spies everywhere - your friends and neighbours could very well have been spies. They would report on you to the government, and if you behaved in a way that the government didn't like (listened to pirated western radio or music, talked against the system, etc) they would come for your at night and question you and intimidate you (they'd beat you up), and that was never fun.

Overall it had good and bad points like any other system, and in many ways was more human-friendly than today's world, but then in many other was it wasn't.

marx,"&gt; because there are still capitalist states out there, then even though all of Europe is practicing every tenant of communism except no govt (because of the need for a dotp for protection) they said that was STILL not communism.

Because of the way that Capitalism has managed to become a global phenomenon (faster technological advancements leading to the obsoletion of previous modes of production, which increases the contradictions within them, leading to large scale Capitalist revolutions), Communism in virtue must also be global. This is because (most of) the resources required to produce much of our technology today is only found in certain parts of the world. Using the example you provided of Europe, the Communists would still have to participate in international trade and competition with Capitalist nations in order to gain access to specific materials. Communism operates purely using a gift economy, which is free of trade (as it has been rendered obsolete).

&gt; However, I may need you to elaborate on this. Can you help me understand how his analysis through looking at physical matter makes his analysis more accurate/realistic than others?

So Idealism, which is essentially the philosophy that through your five senses, the way you interpret the world, is correct. The material world is seen as secondary, and through using purely your own sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch, this is the way we as humans understand the world around us. Now the problem with this is that everyone experiences the world differently, and therefore makes subjective analysis (seeing things as good, bad, evil etc.) and limits us to our own biases.
The purpose of Materialism is to look solely at matter, and to explain the world through a physical process in order to avoid subjective biases (evolution verses creationism for example). It is the understanding that everything around us moves, changes, and operates due to external or internal material influence. For example, an idealist analysis of Nazi Germany may say that it was evil, whereas a materialist one would explain the physical circumstances that pushed them to their destination.
Basically our brains are matter that is interpreting other matter.

&gt; saying he didn't want to change it and therefore his analysis is somehow completely objective and non-biased is misleading to say the least.

Apologies if that is what you felt I implied in my response, I should have been clearer. The reason Marx’s understanding of Capitalism is empirically correct is because it has been cleared free from the mists of ideology. Liberal analysis fails in this respect is because the axiom of Liberalism is intrinsically pro Capital, and so begin their analysis with this belief firmly held, which obviously distorts their understanding. Marx looks at how Capitalism works and functions free from ideological distortions because in order to overthrow it, we must understand exactly how it operates free from preconceived positive or negative notions. 

&gt; That's not really the point of the invisible hand. It wasn't that it was a catch-all explanation for aspects of the market he didn't understand. The invisible hand was a description he used for how overall spontaneous order could take place in the absence of a master coordinator/designer.

Thanks for the correction, I still have yet to read Adam Smith (have Wealth of Nations on my reading list) and don’t have a strong grasp of Marxian economics, so I won’t argue against anything you wrote.

Sorry for the late replies and if none of this makes any sense (long ass day at work), but I am enjoying this discussion.

,"This is quite a difficult question to answer shortly. The whole idea of ""being stopped by police"" is quite a new invention.

Before the idea of individual rights became the basis of government (before the English, French and American revolutions, basically), ""the police"" were really only the henchmen of the local power base. Their ability to make a person submit depended on the status of that person. The nobility and clergy were basically immune (being part of the power base, and therefore usually having henchmen of their own), and everyone else were expected to submit out of hand. The police didn't need any overwhelming force to make ordinary people submit - if someone didn't submit, he and his family would face retaliation: int the extreme case their houses and farms would be burnt down and their livestock seized, usually without any trial. Peoples hopes of avoiding this kind of arbitrary violence rested on the ability and willingness of the local nobleman to protect them. This is the basis of the feudal system: the nobility protect the people from external threats, and the people submit to them completely within certain parameters, which were usually considered kind of divine. This inequity resulted in literally thousands of peasant revolts in Europe during the middle ages, none of which had much influence, except to strengthen the social order.

It is also important to understand, that back in those times running away wasn't really an option. The communities were so small that everyone knew everyone. Only in large cities could the people of lower classes evade the police. In the example given by OP, the constable would probably have known the person he stopped, and even if that person would have been able to escape, the constable would have shown up at his house the next day to conduct the business he wanted. Moving to an another community would also have been out of the question - people were defined by where they lived and who they were related to.

Only after the total - although slow and sporadic - disintegration of this social order in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries would there be any sense in this question. Only then would there have been a meeting between a policeman and an ordinary person, where the policeman didn't have almost-absolute power over the person - without the need for weapons - through the feudal power structure. It is difficult for people today to understand the gigantic shift that the Enlightenment really was - this is actually a good example.

So now that the premise has been laid down, the answer is quite simple: not much. Muzzle loading firearms were ridiculously slow to load*, and the breech loading -mechanism wasn't really that much faster. The police relied really only on numbers throughout the centuries between the seventeenth and twentieth. Highwaymen and other armed professional criminals were hunted by whole squadrons of cavalry. Meeting a lone policeman that demanded your submission would have been strange. 

Industrialization makes the whole picture quite muddled. On the one hand it brought a huge amount of firepower to the police in the form of automatic weapons and armored cars, but it also armed the criminals. This resulted in a lot of death, with gangsters and police shooting at each other on the streets. The setting under consideration wouldn't have been that much different - the policeman would have a revolver, and your escape would have been more difficult, but his power over you wouldn't have been that overwhelming.

It's really only in the last half-century that the police have been getting the upper hand with all this new technology. Unfortunately it seems that the ancient power structure is still there: the use of this power is still somewhat arbitrary.

,"&gt; How was George Osborne and Cameron able to secure 30bn of Chinese deals recently while still being in the EU?

Because that was not a trade deal. That was us selling our infrastructure in order to get it built.

&gt; The way trade deals are now done is by blocks, not bilaterally. The USA signed a trade deal with the the pacific asian area for example, not some small 5m nation. 

That's one way to do it, but not the only way. Are you saying that it would not be worth our time to trade with a nation like, say, New Zealand because it only has 4.4m people living there?

&gt; And the EU is looking to create a trade deal with the USA, if you are out of the EU you wouldn't get that massive trade deal.

Sure. But outside of the EU you wouldn't need to because you'd have more say in creating your own.

&gt; What advantage on agricultural policy is there for being outside the EU really? All the EU seems to do is just pay farmers lots and subsidize them.

technology,"Excellent answer; I have very little to add.

This, though: in the Cold War game, particularly during the early years when Europe could still conceivably turn at least friendlier towards the Soviet Union, building trade relations with the U.S. was clearly seen as one method of anchoring European countries towards Western-friendly alignment.

For example, I've been recently reading up on Finland's trade relations in the post-war period. Those histories make it abundantly clear that it was in the U.S. government's interests to develop mutual trade relations between U.S. and Finland (for example), and the explicit purpose for even subsidising firms for doing that was to prevent Finland from sliding closer towards the Russians. After all, if Finnish firms (for example) could not do business in American markets, they might do business with the Communist bloc. Similarly, if the Finns could not purchase goods and equipment from the West, they might purchase them from the East, tying them closer to the East.

Perhaps the most blatant examples of this game are the U.S. efforts to stop Finland from selling ships to Communist countries during the early 1950s. This went as far as the U.S. government trying to find Western buyers for Finnish-built ships; however, the U.S. found they had relatively few tools available to induce commercial firms to purchase ships they didn't want.

Playerbase *is* low, but it's still easy enough for most people to get games. PC currently has around [30.000 active players](http://steamspy.com/app/273350), with concurrent player numbers varying from ~150 to ~700. from some numbers given by the devs a while ago it would suggest that PS population is roughly twice the size of the PC community. The ones with a hard time finding games are the people located in regions like Australia and such. As long as you live in central Europe or US, there shouldn't be big trouble with finding games.

Most of the people playing atm are the skilled players that have been there from the start, and the new players that have picked it up on recent sales. Most of the skilled players are friendly and helpful, and will give you tips to master the game. There are of course some salty ones in there too though. Experience is best if you use a mic to communicate, and of course it's always good to add people you liked playing with to your friends list.

A new monster and two new hunter adaptions (like a rework of a current hunter, which is its own separate character) are coming out tomorrow, which should definitely boost the player numbers for a couple of weeks.

People have before bashed it for not having enough content in the base game, but I would disagree. Base game has 12 very different hunters and 3 even more different monsters. And there's ~20 maps and a couple of game modes. And the devs are even doing weekend events every other weekend where the community takes on a challenge to unlock skins.

This ultimate edition has a lot of content besides the base game too though. 8 hunters (two are yet to be released though) and then there's 2 monsters: Behemoth and Gorgon. + there's like 12 skins included. But as I said, there's a lot of content in the base game too (and by no means are the base base game characters worse than the DLC ones). And you can always play with/against the DLC monsters and hunters even if you don't own the DLC yourself.

Evolve *is* a great game, but also quite a niche title. Biggest problem is pricing if you ask me. Sorry for the long post.

TL;DR: I like Evolve, it's a good game. Playerbase is kinda low though, but it's still very playable.

,"The mainstream media tends to tell the establishment story.

The establishment story has always, since the beginning, favored Israel.

From the outset, Zionists had links into European and US governments that the Palestinians never had. They had links into society, business, media, culture that Palestinians never had, which is why lobbying for a Jewish state in Palestine was ultimately successful against the combined lobbying of the entire Arab Middle East.

For example, there simply is no Palestinian equivalent to the scale and reach of AIPAC, which formed in 1951. Pro-Israel lobbying groups are considerably better funded, more numerous and larger than their Palestinian equivalents by an order of magnitude. For media and politicians alike, this means the pressure to adopt a pro-Israel position and to shift the baseline of 'neutral' away from a Palestinian narrative is far stronger on one side. It also means there is a stream of pro-Israel content and talking points unmatched on the Palestinian side that is readily available to content producers (who are themselves under more pressure to create content more quickly and cheaply). In more recent times  -especially since 9/11, the growing relationship between Republicanism and Israel has meant that many think tanks and lobbying groups reflexively treat conservative foreign policy and pro-Israeli foreign policy as one and the same.

Palestinians were - still are - hopelessly unequipped to deal with this. They had no lobbying power in Britain at the time of the Balfour Declaration. While Israel could call on men like Abba Eban to promote their cause abroad [post-independence] and already had built what would become a very strong lobbying machine, Palestinians had no external lobbying network, had few fluent advocates to make their case and accordingly had no reach into the media. Their lobbying was done through Arab countries and the Arab league and was a total failure for many reasons.

And, frankly, US and European media and media consumers reflexively sided with the white, European [heritage] leaders of Israel, and who *still* dominate political, diplomatic and cultural life. By contrast, Palestinian Arabs were stuck in Lawrence of Arabian tropes and the prevailing colonial outlook Europe especially still adopted towards its existing and former territories. They are still stuck in the past, some of which is entirely their own fault. The language of the PA top brass is that of international diplomacy for the most part. Hamas, the PFLP and other Palestinian factions are media dinosaurs. 

For most of post-war Europe and the US events in Israel and Palestine were of little consequence. They happened *somewhere else*, and Europe especially had more and bigger concerns - the Cold War, the dissolution of its colonies, rebuilding after WW2, the emergence of pop culture for a generation of baby boomers. It was only in the late 1960s and 1970s when Palestinians got media coverage. Initially in two wars positioned as David (Israel) and Goliath (Arabs) affairs. Then, more publicity for the wrong reasons: the various terrorist attacks perpetrated outside Palestine. Those events effectively set the tone for how Palestinians - almost invisible until then - would be seen in the mainstream eye. Nobody asked or cared what they were fighting or why. They only knew what they had done. Those attacks set the tone for a generation of Western media. After the briefest of respites in the eighties when brown, muslim people made a fleeting appearance in Hollywood as noble Cold War warriors - the credits of Rambo and Art Malik's turn in The Living Daylights being notable examples - it was back to normal. Eventually 9/11 would happen and the conflict and occupation would be repositioned - like most of the US's Middle Eastern foreign policy - for Western media as a battle against Islam, a narrative for which Hamas still prove to be the useful idiots.

But after the 1970s attacks, the first intifada of the late eighties largely passed without notice outside Israel. The media quickly bored of pictures of Palestinian youths flinging stones at the IDF and never bothered to report anything beyond the old, contextless cliché of 'tensions flare in Israel'. The second was dominated not by the appalling death toll of Palestinian civilians, including considerable numbers of women and minors, but by Hamas's suicide attacks. You can still see this imbalance to this day: almost without fail, every Israeli victim is given a loving write up that humanizes them and the terrible impact of their murder on the lives of their family.

Palestinians, for the most part, are just killed. They don't get obituaries. When they are killed an intensive lobbying effort swings into action to repeat the prevailing narrative that those civilians killed are unfortunate collateral damage of a moral army, or human shields etc etc. The racist quote attributed to Golda Meir of Palestinians blaming Palestinians for not caring enough about life still does useful service today in various guises.

But it is changing.

There are, belatedly, three reasons why this shift in 'ownership' of the narrative is finally moving away from Israel and towards Palestine.

Firstly, the corrosive effect of the occupation, of the blockade of Gaza, of settlements, of repeated attacks on Palestinians is undeniable. There is now a broad caucus of groups that now either advocate for Palestinians or are more inclined to do so. This includes centrists in Europe, liberal Jews and Anglicans - three important groups that were not traditionally in the camp of Palestinians.

The second reason is that social media and the internet have democratized news. And as such, it has made it far harder for Israel to control the narrative. We can now see pictures from Gaza and the West Bank. Ordinary Palestinians like Farah Baker actually have an authentic voice that no lobbying group in Washington or Paris can ever acquire.

Thirdly, US power is on the decline in the Middle East, slowly. It has totally failed to transform Baathist Iraq into a pro-US client state. Its activities in Syria have handed huge territory to extremists. Its clients in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Bahrain hold power against the will of the people and require considerable support to keep on side. Turkey is no longer a passive NATO ally willing to toe the US line. Iran has had to be accommodated. And, frankly, Europe now recognises and the US *may* be recognizing that it will need a different approach to Israel in the face of more pressure in the region. 

Compounding this, Israel's lurch right makes for a difficult regime to love. The new right in Israel sounds more messianic and more extreme than the old guard of secular hard men who once ruled Israel. Israel, with far greater numbers of vocal religious nationalists, feels a lot less like it did twenty years ago.

,"So having foreign armies come in in 1945, dictating their own terms to the German people and pretty much controlling every day life (which is what they did--positive speech or press about the Nazi regime was flat out banned) is a more preferable ending than WWI, where Germany remained completely sovereign in domestic politics? Are you serious? 

&gt;but the governments were elected by the people and were most definitley German.

In the West, yes. But it isn't like the Western Allies were going to allow anything else but Western-style democracy in their zones, either (not that West Germans wanted fascism back or to become communists, but that wasn't going to happen even if they did). In the Soviet-zone the elections you're speaking of never occurred and there was never really anything other than a rather rapid restructuring of East Germany toward Stalinism. 

&gt;If you honestly think the Germans faired better after the treaty of Versailles than after WWII you've got a lot of reading to do.

You're looking through the lens of Germany's post-war history and their current place in the world and not the actual history as it happened. You're arguing that a Marshall Plan should have been adopted of some sort after WWI correct? Impossible. This would have sounded ludicrous because France and Belgium were the ones living in utter destruction following the war, not Germany, whose country wasn't the site of massive looting and destruction by occupying/retreating armies or endless shelling in months-long battles. The Marshall Plan was implemented after WWII ended (three years after mind you...the original plan the Allies had for Germany was to slice it up and make the former industrial powerhouse an agrarian nation) because The West feared that leaving central Europe flattened and starving would point them towards the Soviet system. 

The situation in 1918 was far different. Germany had not been bombed and invaded into rubble, and it geo-strategic situation had actually not worsened that much. Russia, it's nemesis to the east had now massively lost territory and was in the chaos of a civil war while the new Germany was now being surrounded by weak, small, newly created countries to the east and in the Balkans. Giving a massive economic boost to a country that had just started a war and torn Europe apart (especially when you don't occupy--that is control that country) was unthinkable.

I guess what we're getting to here is you're of the opinion that Germany should have been invaded in 1918/1919, its cities destroyed, its government toppled and replaced with a British/French/American influenced one, and then rebuilt from the ground up, as it was after WWII? And that would have been BETTER for the Germans than Versailles was?

And that might be right, who knows.  But I think 99.9% of all Germans living in 1918 would disagree. Many millions would probably have died to prevent that from happening.

EDIT: Besides, in terms of giving massive aid to countries with economic problems after WWI, was Germany--the enemy--really going to be higher on the list than the UK or France, who never paid their war loans to the United States (and still haven't?) I'm sure that would have went over well. ",AskReddit,0,1,CarlinGenius,1,1446464501,1446464200,t1_cwlh057,t5_2qh1i,cwlhnxu,t3_3r3zs7,,1449546416,,0,

Wait a minute, so you think that whilst Russia would have the time to build up its army on Europe's border; Europe and European countries (including Britain France and Germany) would not be able to do the same?

No it's not... It applies to any sort of invasion from Russia. At present they have almost 0 logistical capabilities beyond their borders and the capabilities they do have would be used for a very ill equipped, badly trained and low moral army. Active personnel are estimated to number ~800,00. EU nations have active personnel of ~1.5 million.

You are vastly over estimating the capabilities of the Russian armed forces if you really think they could organise an invasion of Europe firstly without Europe making any defensive moves to secure its eastern border and secondly that Russia could even get its forces further than the Baltics, Belarus or Ukraine.

You then proceed to provide no examples of studies that say as such. Here's another one that says they are mostly liberal, and I'll find another one after that if you want.

Daniel De Leon was a Marxist, Marxism is NOT the only form of socialism much as you guys seem to think it is. It's not even the most prevalent form of socialism, it's an utterly fringe niche.

It is utterly, utterly ridiculous how Marxists in this thread are pathetically trying to claim that THEIR specific and extreme niche version of socialism is the Only True Socialism.

The term ""socialism"" predates Marx and was co-opted first by him and later by Lenin. Why on earth are *their* specific versions of it the only valid one?

According to you guys no self-described socialist in Europe is actually socialist, the British Labour party despite describing itself as democratic socialist isn't, the French Socialist Party isn't, the Spanish Socialist Party isn't, the Socialist International isn't, the Party of European Socialists isn't, because no one who isn't an extreme niche Marxist is a socialist in your eyes.

reckons Stockholm is a great place to rent - everyone knows it's not

http://qz.com/264418/why-its-nearly-impossible-to-rent-an-apartment-in-stockholm/


&gt;Stockholm is today one of the few capitals in the world where you cannot simply move to and hope to find a rental. You either have to wait in Stockholm’s official housing line, which has about half a million people ahead of you, or you can wait in one of the co-op lines, which own 28% of rental properties. Yet, if you look to Sweden’s largest co-op, there are exactly zero apartments available in Greater Stockholm.
Today, estimates have Stockholm lacking an astounding 431,144 housing units at the end of 2013. That’s an 8% increase from the year before.

Well in the kind of medieval setting Pathfinder tends to be in, the Mongols would be the empire with immense wealth and advanced that western kingdoms want to trade with. Geoffrey Chaucer even called Genghis Khan ""King of Kings"" in his ""Knight's Tale"" poetry.

It's only around the 1700's that they became 'barbarians', after Voltaire wrote a play that portrayed Genghis Khan as a brutish king which was meant to be a criticism of (then) modern European monarchy. Voltaire was a huge sinophile and picked up their biases towards the Mongols. 

Playing as Mongol PC's would be interesting, fighting against swarms of western knights and capturing their castles, maybe even making alliances with the faithful who believe you're punishing angels sent to cleanse sinners.

- Stygg i Norge (även Värmland) betyder *ful*. Även detta är ett exempel på när svenska har strulat till det.

- Gurka heter kort och gott, ""agurk"". Otroligt roligt tycker jag!

- Det finns inget som heter ""gulebøj"" i Norge. Däremot så heter morot ""gulrot"", och du kan i butik köpa ""gule gulrøtter"", alltså gula morötter!

- Vi har en vana att kalla flickor för ""tös"" i Värmland, kommer du till Norge däremot så bör du se upp med det, då ""tøs"" på norska betyder hora.

- Undvik även att beställa en bärs på krogen, ""bæsj"" uttalas detsamma och betyder bajskorv.

- Ordet för växellåda har dom lånat från engelskans ""gearbox"", på norska så säger du alltså ""girboks"", lägg särskilt märke till ordet ""boks"" för-

- Norrmän älskar ordena ""boks"" och ""stoff"". Saker jag hört norrmän kalla boks: pantburk, hink, låda, askkopp, snusdosa, ja egentligen allt som du kan stoppa saker i. Saker jag hört norrmän kalla ""stoff"": vaddning och stoppning i tyger, knark, allmänna saker och ting, medicin, nyhettstoff, allt som har materia egentligen.

- En annan personlig favorit är deras ord för snabel-a, som då alltså betyder ""alfakrøll"". De har dock lika kul åt vårat ord som vad vi har åt deras.

- Allt som är vattenrelaterat är tämligen förvirrande också. ""Sjø"" betyder del av hav, ""innsjø"" är det som vad vi kallar sjö, ""vann/vatn"" betyder vatten, men kan även betyda mindre sjö. ""Is"" betyder is som på svenska, men kan även betyda glass. ""Glass"" betyder glas, fråga mig inte hur man säger isglass på norska dock.

- När norrmän åker till sydeuropeiska länder så åker dom till ""Syden"". Tycker det är väldigt charmigt och lite smått fascinerande att dom brukar vara så ospecifika med vart dom åker på semester genom att bara svara söderut, som om att det gick att resa längre norrut.

Exactly and on the flip side Tanker Denial is one of the things that could cripple the U.S operating in that area. It is kind of a pointless exercise really, any state big enough to sustain an airforce worth thinking about would not get involved in a war.

Purely looking at things by numbers is also a bit pointless. The Saudis have a high spec military and on paper could have rolled over Iraq in Gulf War 1 had they wanted to. Yet they still wanted international help.

You can buy all the latest gadgets you want but unless you have the training, the maintenance and the mind set to develop tactics it makes you a paper tiger. The Saudis have a mix of front line U.S and EU military equipment but are struggling with guerrilla groups in the south of the peninsula.

The other example is the new Iraqi and Afghan Armed Forces. Iraq in particular was de-Baath'd expunging the people with experience. When ISIS popped up as a rag tag bunch of vicious bastards the Iraqi army outgunned them significantly but often dropped kit and ran rather then hold and fight whilst calling in reinforcements, air assets etc.

,"The most obvious examples are proper land reform and assisted dying. Overwhelming public demand for these matters to be addressed in particular. On land reform, the party membership, which is far from rebellious, had to tell them to go back and be braver. Sturgeon should be leading from the front on that. On assisted dying, 85% of Scots want it to be legal. I think it's logical to assume that an even higher percentage of the SNP's voters hold this opinion, since objections on this usually come from the right. So why are the SNP, by a clear majority within the party, including the First Minister, out of line with the Scottish public on this question? Remember, they didn't just reject Patrick Harvie's bill on its detail, they rejected the bill in principle, and along with it, the opportunity to debate the details. That's not radical, and it's well to the right of public opinion. 

Aside from that, matters such as the strengthening of local democracy, which is the weakest in Europe. The SNP are not the centralising maniacs the opposition try to paint them as, but it's clear they have no interest in dividing decision making and spending down to a more local level. That is an integral part of the Scandinavian model of social democracy which the SNP have been happy to claim aspiration to.

I also find it hard to take someone seriously, who calls for radical reform, and decries the absence of democracy in the system, while supporting monarchy. 

Redistribution of wealth is harder, with no real control over budgets or borrowing.

Maar dat doen we nu ook al met het lesprogramma voor de middelbare school. Ik zie niet waarom dat voor taalonderwijs op de lagere school opeens niet zou kunnen. Of dat dat daarvoor heel veel moeilijker is.

En mijn keuze voor engels, spaans, en duits is vrij eenvoudig: engels is zo'n beetje het 'europese esparanto' geworden; spaans is een romaanse wereldtaal waarmee je jezelf prima kunt redden in zuid-amerika en het zuiden van de verenigde staten (jawel!). Daarnaast, als je spaans kent wordt italiaans, frans en roemeens ook een stuk makkelijker, omdat die talen veel gelijkenis met elkaar hebben.   Duits is de taal van onze oosterburen, waar we veel handel mee drijven.

,"In my opinion, the real turning point in Europe during World War 2 was Operation Typhoon: the battle of Moscow.  

At the outset of Operation Barbarossa Germany's army was well-equipped, well-led and battle hardened but also numerically inferior to the Red Army.  Germany's economy wasn't on a full war-time footing either and so had considerable slack which wouldn't be taken up in war production until 1943-44.  By contrast, the Soviets would start the war fully committed to maximizing war-time production.  As a result, despite the enormous losses of territory and population during 1941, already by 1942 Soviet war production had passed Germany's and despite losing 4 million soldiers (killed, wounded and captured) during Operation Barbarossa the Red Army was *larger* at the start of 1942 than it was when Operation Barbarossa began.

In the face of such a massive mobilization of resources and manpower, Germany had to win quickly.  That was the whole point of Blitzkrieg: the rapid defeat of enemy military forces so as to not require full wartime mobilization.  While the German army invaded Russia in three huge movements toward Leningrad, Moscow and Kiev, the stated objective of Operation Barbarossa was to destroy the Red Army in Western Russia in 6-8 weeks.  The Germans failed to accomplish the task, partly because there were more Russian divisions than they had anticipated (303 vs. 240) and partly because it was too ambitious for their forces to carry out.  The emphasis on destroying enemy forces is why, for example, Germany's army group centre was diverted south toward Kiev and away from Moscow to help destroy the massive Soviet formation there.

After the Battle of Kiev, most of Germany's military forces headed for Moscow.  At the outset of Operation Typhoon 60%+ of Germany's total military strength was concentrated on the massive offensive for the city.  The Russian's stopped the German offensive and in so doing inflicted enormous losses in manpower and materiel on the Germans.  The Soviet counteroffensive ran out of steam and left the Germans defending an enormous front line with fewer divisions than the Soviets had.

I think this was the final turning point.  The 1942 offensive by the Germans was initially a strategic withdrawal by the Soviets followed by a bloodbath in Stalingrad and an enormous counteroffensive.  At the Kursk Germany was hoping to shorten their own line and blunt the Soviet's ability to conduct offensives.  By that time the war was about survival rather than renewed invasions of the USSR.  

The Germans certainly weren't defeated after Moscow, but I think it's fair to say that after that point it was the Soviet's war to lose rather than the German's to win.

,"All kinds of drugs have been used in social contexts, and the social aspect is part of what makes addiction so hard to fight.

Alcohol was the major drug in Europe since Ancient times, but this was not the case for cultures in others parts of the world (e.g., peyote in South America, tobacco in North America, opiates in Asia). Because Europeans became so dominant, we ended up exporting our favorite drugs to most parts of the world, but it didn't use to be that way.

However, in all of these cultures people took drugs, even happy rich people, in order to participate in the social fabric of their societies.

BELG,"Dear Andrew Cooper, 

I'd like to ask about nuclear policy. While it seems to me that most voters are opposed to the use of nuclear power, the question of ""okay, then what else?"" seems to be one that doesn't get addressed often enough. Basically, 

* In researching the clean-technology market for Japan and other G-7 markets, I've understood that investing a diversified renewable-based energy supply today will yeild results the kinds of results we'd like to see, but decades in the future.

* What do we do in the mean-time? I've understood that parts of the EU are more inclined to be friendly to the Russians for this reason (energy access), while pro-nuclear voices in Europe point to this exact dilemma, and AmCham Belgium seems to favor fracking in Belgium in the short-term, since there's a large shale and gas deposit stretching from Denmark to Normandy, which Belgium could access as an alternative to nuclear (but with possibly disastrous environmental consequences).  

So what are your views about how the EU and its member nations should proceed on this issue? ",europe,0,4,mberre,4,False,1446473530,t3_3r6zq0,t5_2qh4j,cwlkv8z,t3_3r6zq0,Belgium,1449547925,,0,
,"&gt; Why is it impossible to find out how many people have lighter skin tones?

We don't ask people what their skin colour is, we extrapolate from ethnicity. And not all English/ Scottish/ Dutch/ German people will be too light for foundation. Obviously not all Aboriginal people will be too dark for foundation but I overestimated the number of people meaning the actual figure is even lower. 

&gt; 15.8% of respondents identified as other

I believe what's happened here is the world fact book breaks the data into more subcategories while the scource I quoted combines them all into 1 'white' category. For instance, the census data is given in more detail [here](http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/CO-62) and adding together just the European/ Australian ancestries gives you 96.6% as well as 4% Chinese (obviously theres overlap but the point remains, only up to 0.5% are Aboriginal but as many of them will be mixed heritage not all of them have dark skin. As I'll explain in a second, having some European ancestry means it's much more likely people will be light enough to fit into the standard foundation range. 

&gt; 15.8% of respondents identified as other

Yes? Why are you annoyed at me for not considering data I wan't sure about? We have no idea what ethnicity was represented here but we can't assume they're either very dark skinned or not. The fact that the only ethnicity with dark skin (Aboriginals) was less than 1% means than **darker skin colour is by far the minority in Australia** which is really the point I'm trying to make.

&gt; Do you have a scientific article to support this assertion

[This fun thing called genetics?](https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-918dfaf31f950477d62ffcc5f2b6ce5c?convert_to_webp=true) We know there's at least 8 loci involved in melatonin production and while sometimes children can be lighter or darker than their parents. Someone with very dark skin having a child with a lighter skinned person will generally produce babies with lighter skin (who will therefore find it easier to find foundation). This is the whole basis behind the stolen generation, 'half-caste' children looked more European and were therefore forcibly raised in European society. Therefore even if someone identifies aboriginal ancestry, any secondary or tertiary ancestries (unless they are of similarly dark skin) will produce people with lighter skin tones thus meaning they don't fit into the target audience for very dark foundation.

&gt; Out of 8 categories listed, the products we're discussing only fall into one category, unless you're assuming people of darker skin tones (as this is all your comment addressed) are also ""[demanding] that [companies] supply an incredibly niche product"" in all of these areas, in which case I do wonder why you'd think skin tone would factor into the use of, for example, perfume or even moisturiser?

Well, that's a fair criticism, but I don't think it's as case disabling as you make it out to be. 

Firstly, many companies and brands are invested in a variety of those categories. The [EL group](http://www.elcompanies.com/pages/our-brands.aspx) for instance includes not only cosmetic companies but also skin and hair care. A store like priceline, sephora or mecca stock many if not all of those categories and it therefore makes sense to look at the category holistic. For a brand to stock a wider range of shades, it requires more money on imports, advertising and shelf space and it is just not profitable to do it for such a tiny, tiny proportion of their industry. 

However, I'm going to try and adjust my calculations to consider only makeup. 

The [EL group](http://investors.elcompanies.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=109458&amp;p=irol-reportsannual) are one of the biggest makeup groups, they had net sales of 10.78 billion in their last year, 40% of that for makeup and 20% of that in the Asia-Pacific region. That's 862.4 million USD or ~1.2 billion AUD.  Even if everyone in our Australian target demographic buys the expensive MAC foundation we're still coming in under 1% of EL groups sales for this 1 product type in this 1 region. Now consider that not everyone will buy the premium foundation, in fact the most common complaint is that it's too expensive to buy that foundation and you're back to far less than the number we arrived at. 


Whatever way you look at it, **there is just not a large demand for these products**. Companies don't choose not to supply something for the hell of it, if there was sufficient demand to justify the added expense in imports, marketing, shelf space ect then companies would do it. At the moment we only have a few higher end brands offering these products. There is not room for a huge amount more of competition and for most companies it's not worth the time and effort to provide this. If there was money to be made, everyone would be doing it. Again, capitalism at work. Yes it sucks, but it's not some evil racist conspiracy. It's profit driven business tactics.

,"Eu diria que é algo ligado a viés de confirmação e/ou cherry picking. 

Primeiro, o PT, quando o Haddad foi eleito, não tinha uma reprovação tão grande quanto hoje pois o país ainda estava em uma situação econômica razoável e os escândalos de corrupção ainda não tinham estourado.

Agora, os efeitos que eu citei acima basicamente fazem as pessoas magnificarem (ou notarem apenas) as decisões ruins ou as partes que elas não gostam do Haddad e ignoram as partes boas. Ou seja, elas apenas enxergam apenas o que que elas já ""sabem"" (viés de confirmação): ""O Haddad é do PT e o PT é um partido ruim. Ele não sabe planejar, olha como essa ciclovia aqui está descascando!""

O problema é que ao fazer esse tipo de racional, e não partindo de um ponto neutro (sair procurando problema) impede de ver o outro lado das coisas, por exemplo: ""Essa aqui está descascando, mas a da Paulista subiu rapido e está bem conservada. É necessário examinar outras coisas antes de entender e tomar conclusões.""

Basicamente, ao examinar algo que as pessoas tem antipatia (ou a antipatia aumentou), faz com que elas tomem conclusões que talvez não reflitam a realidade. Um exemplo é as pessoas ""saberem"" que mulher dirige pior, então quando alguém faz besteira sempre checam ""que deve ter sido mulher"" (e realmente é o que enxergam, pois ignora-se quando é homem). Mulheres, por outro lado, tem seguro de carro mais baixo, o que vai contra essa ideia.

One game was an angry kid that got mad when I told him to stop complaining because he was dragging down team morale (constant cursing and blaming on others while he wasn't doing great himself). He killed me twice before getting a 7 day cooldown.

Other game was with a 4 stack and I was their random. I had a rough start, got insta rekt the first 2 rounds and then remained a bottom fragger till round #6. They were only communicating in an eastern European language and I only heard English when they were complaining to me, telling me what to do and how shit I was. In return I did what I always do and mute all the assholes. 

Just carried on playing the game and started becoming alive on the leaderboard but after a while they probably noticed I had muted them (probably the reason I started getting frags in the first place) and then they 4 man bodyblocked me at spawn before killing me in the middle of the round several times.

,"**Vakbonden moeten vooral niet meedenken met het beleid**

*De Standaard - 2015/11/01*

Wie? Vincent Scheltiens, Historicus, onderzoeker aan de Universiteit Antwerpen

Wat? De regering rekent op de vakbonden om haar beleid te legitimeren. Omdat ze weet dat dat beleid niet te legitimeren valt.

De rabiate aanval die op de vakbonden is ingezet, dringt ze in het defensief, zoals ook ACV-topman Marc Leemans (DS 31 oktober) moet toegeven. Enerzijds luidt de kritiek dat de bonden zijn blijven steken in de vorige eeuw. Ze vormen een rem op elke vooruitgang en zouden zich enkel om de eigen machtspositie bekommeren. Anderzijds weigeren de critici de voor hen logische conclusie te trekken dat de vakbonden zich overbodig gemaakt hebben. Vakbonden zijn nodig, klinkt het verrassend, maar dan moderne vakbonden die ‘meedenken’ over de modernisering van de samenleving. Deze contradictie maakt duidelijk wat de achilleshiel is van de beleidsmakers.

**Buitenspel**

Aan de basis van de radicale aanvallen op de vakbonden ligt een dogma. De critici gaan ervan uit dat het huidige besparingsbeleid noodzakelijk is. Wie zich verzet tegen de eenzijdige besparingen op arbeids- en vervangingsinkomens, zet zich volgens hen buitenspel. Hetzelfde geldt voor wie openbare dienstverlening weigert in handen te geven van private spelers die de diensten alleen nog zullen leveren als ze er winst op kunnen maken. Deze dogmatici doen het verzet tegen dit bezuinigingsbeleid af als irrationeel, oubollig. De vakbond, zo schrijven ze, heeft een probleem.

Die retoriek moet verbergen dat de regering een probleem heeft. Het ontbreekt haar beleid aan legitimiteit. Het is het probleem van elke regering die de eenzijdige Europese neoliberale dictaten toepast in haar lidstaat. Hoezo? Zelfs wanneer de beleidsmakers retorisch plooien en zich het begrip ‘taxshift’ toe-eigenen, worden alweer de loon- en steuntrekkenden belast en de grote vermogens ongemoeid gelaten. Opwerpen dat de legitimiteit voor dit asociale beleid op de verkiezingsuitslag steunt, klopt niet. Geen enkele regeringspartij voerde campagne voor een verhoging van de pensioenleeftijd, het eenzijdig belasten van werkende en werkloze mensen, het creatief invoeren van een reeks nieuwe belastingen die ze nu nog steeds niet bij naam durft te noemen.

**Onder valse vlag**

Dat legitimiteitsprobleem verklaart waarom de rechtse regeringspartijen onder valse vlag varen. Terwijl net hun sociaal-economisch beleid erop gericht is de klok terug te draaien naar diep in de vorige eeuw (precarisering, verarming, bestaansonzekerheid), eigenen ze zich de begrippen ‘modern’ en ‘progressief’ toe en trachten ze de vakbonden in het nauw te drijven door ze weg te zetten als ‘conservatief’. Mochten deze partijen onder eigen vlag – dus zonder de retorische toe-eigening van deze begrippen – de kiezer tegemoet gaan, dan zou hun aanhang sterk afkalven.

Er wordt dus op de vakbonden gerekend om het beleid te legitimeren. Geen enkele organisatie heeft immers de representativiteit die de bonden hebben. Dat komt doordat behalve de vakbonden niemand 2,5 miljoen mensen verenigt. Omdat ze de enige organisaties zijn die snel honderdduizend mensen op straat kunnen brengen. Omdat ‘de vakbond’ in de praktijk een gigantisch netwerk van kaders, militanten en leden is, die op de werkvloer collega’s kunnen informeren en laten beseffen dat ze niet de speelbal van de werkgever hoeven te zijn. Omdat weinig tot geen werknemers ontkennen dat ze hun levensstandaard historisch aan de syndicale massa-acties te danken hebben.

Daarom pleit rechts niet voor de afschaffing van de bonden, maar roept ze die op ‘mee te denken’. Om dat gedaan te krijgen wordt zowel de stok als de wortel gehanteerd. Enerzijds wordt gedreigd met het belasten van syndicale premies, het omvormen van vakbonden tot rechtspersonen, het opleggen van dwangsommen aan piketten. Anderzijds gaat men ervan uit dat de bonden ‘vooral aan zichzelf denken’ en garen kunnen spinnen bij het ‘meedenken’. Men is dus bereid ‘meedenkende’ vakbondsleiders, naast privileges, ook wat sociale kruimels toe te schuiven.

**Dogmatische praatjes**

Vakbonden zijn er niet om het sociaal en democratisch deficit van de bezuinigingspolitiek weg te moffelen. Uiteraard moet er onderhandeld worden, zijn goede compromissen eerbaar en is het prettiger resultaten te boeken via overleg met wederzijds respect dan in de grimmigheid van een sociaal conflict. Maar vakbonden hoeven niet ‘mee te denken’ over hoe die politiek in heel de Europese Unie de krachtsverhoudingen tussen inkomsten uit kapitaal en die uit arbeid substantieel wil wijzigen in het voordeel van deze laatste. Vakbonden moeten hun eigen denkwerk verrichten. Ze moeten zich verzetten tegen dat afbraakbeleid. Ze moeten er helder over communiceren naar een publieke opinie waarvan bijna iedereen in zijn portefeuille voelt dat de regering liegt. Ze moeten werken aan sociale en democratische alternatieven, want ondanks de praatjes van de dogmatici zijn in een democratie altijd alternatieven mogelijk.

En natuurlijk moet er constant gesleuteld worden aan de optimalisering van de vakbondswerking, haar slagkracht, de timing en dosering van haar acties, haar verhouding tot andere middenveldorganisaties en tot de politiek (en voor wat Marc Leemans betreft: zijn band met de valse vrienden van CD&amp;V). Maar daar hebben de syndicale organisaties honderdduizenden mannen en vrouwen voor, uit alle sectoren en beroepscategorieën, mondige mannen en vrouwen van alle nationaliteiten en origines. Als die meedenken, zit het goed.

,"&gt;Through all of my childhood the big fear was the USSR, but it was bullshit. The USSR could barely keep itself from collapsing.

In 1983--the year you were legally allowed to drink--the Warsaw pact and NATO came very close to nuclear war on multiple occasions. The USSR shot down a South Korean civilian airliner that was carrying a US Congressman. Both sides were rapidly building nuclear arms. The US invaded Grenada. And NATO simulated a European war culminating in a US/UK/French nuclear release.

But that's just one example. Between that example and the Cuban missile example, I think you are underestimating historical threats. That makes me wary of trusting your blasé assessment of current threats.

&gt;It truly is hard to take seriously people getting all bent out of shape over ISIS.

A lot of people got bent out of shape over the ""Black Hand"" terrorist group. The Black Hand controlled no territory and yet they managed to spark a war that killed millions.

The important factor wasn't their (negligible) military power. No major power was going to be conquered by the Black Hand. It was that they are destabilizing force. They were willing to resort to assassinations and acts of terror. Combined with the international tensions of 1914, that upset Europe's precarious balance.

I see a similar possibility with ISIS. ISIS is willing to ignore borders and operate outside of a traditional nation-state framework. They could disturb the tangle of alliances in the Middle East.

The international situation today is tense. Not as tense as 1914, but things are moving in the wrong direction. Russia is annexing land in Europe and China is annexing the international waters to their south. I think it's totally reasonable to take these tensions seriously.

&gt; As experts prepare to analyze the flight recorders, the number of theories speculating about the demise of the Russian plane crash that killed 224 people on Saturday is proliferating by the hour.

&gt; The head of Russian aviation agency Rosaviatsia, Aleksandr Neradko, has said that &amp;quot;All signs testify to the fact that the destruction of the structure of the airplane took place in the air and at a great altitude.&amp;quot; The principal evidence is that the remains of the plane and the bodies have been scattered over an area measuring about 8 km by 4 km.

&gt; Metrojet have been told to temporarily ground their planes, while Russian authorities have begun a safety audit of the small company, which is operating five other jets.

,"&gt; No I'm saying that a lot of people find it just as difficult.

&gt; And missing the point that you're underestimating the people from other ethnicities such as Australians, or Europeans, who also find it hard to buy makeup.

God knows a lot of people find it difficult to match their skin tone to makeup products. Even people who sit comfortably in the range of ""beige"" find it difficult sometimes. But the darker you skin gets and the further away you get from the Eurocentric idea of skin colour the harder it gets to find appropriate products (simply by the law of supply and demand)

&gt; See my above point.

You didn't even try to calculate your own number, you just levelled criticism at my calculation. Calculate a number for the potential financial gain a company would receive if they widened their product range. Or even just give me an estimate for how many people fall outside the ""easy-to get-foundation-for"" group and I'll try and do a better estimate. Until you do that, this is the best we've got. You can constructively contribute but if you don't then we have no other number to work with.  

&gt; We're also referring to people who fit the ""medium"" skin tone range, as in mid way between the most dark and the most light foundation shades currently on the market.

By ""meduim"" you actually mean the median. ie. the central point in the data. What I'm trying to show is that the median is neither the mean (average) or the mode (most common value) in Australia. Australians are, for the vast majority, fair skinned but not in the category of very pale (the amount of sunshine we get factors into this). It is in the financial best interests of a company to provide products that the most number of people will be able to produce. Moving too far away from the mean/mode is lowering your profit margins and it reaches a point where a company decides it's no longer viable so they no longer provide products for people beyond that point, or, if they do, they're a more expensive brand.

&gt; Well many brands do firstly

Then why did you make this thread? Clearly they don't or they do it at too high a cost (again, supply and demand). So either this comment is incorrect, or your whole argument is incorrect.

&gt; If you want to discuss how unprofitable medium shades are, as well as shades on different ends of the spectrum, I'd love to see some logical and factually based maths and stats on that!

,"&gt; *What's your favourite coffee, and how do you like it roasted/brewed?*

With many friends who produce coffee all over Africa, I always hesitate to answer this question. So, with the caveat that everyone should taste a whole range of single origin coffees to find the flavour profile they like best, I personally am a big fan of Ethiopian Fully Washed coffees.

&gt;*What do you see as the largest challenges to the future of African coffee farming, and what steps can be taken to address them?*

This is a big question! with the risk of missing out a lot of things, some of the challenges I see are as follows:-  

1.   Productivity – there is a lack of basic agronomy generally amongst African smallholders, who represent over 95% of African coffee production. With basic zero grazing/organic fertiliser application and some pruning, farmers can see a 50% increase in yields. However, they remain reticent to do any pruning, as they are fearful of losing immediate production. It is part of a wider issue of short-term thinking in the society as a whole.
2.   Lack of market knowledge. It is well documented that knowledge is a big factor in the capitalist economy. Nowhere more so than in the coffee sector. There are a lot of large multinationals in coffee – many of whom do some excellent work in agronomy and solving the above issue, but whom are all companies, and thus needing to make profits. They have better knowledge of international markets, hedging, quality, roaster needs, risk management, insurance, finance etc.. than the growers. Thus, they are in a position of power when determining where profits are taken in the supply chain. The chain is extremely competitive and thus efficient, but local players are always at a disadvantage to the international ones. 
I would love to see local export companies empowered with finance, risk management and knowledge to provide a healthy competition to the international players. This is not as simple as it sounds. Some projects like the [Joint Marketing Initiative](http://jmicoffee.org/) are doing great work along these lines, but there is still a missing piece of being able to provide final buyers with the comfort that they will be delivered what they buy even if the intended suppliers cannot deliver – for whatever reason, be it climatic, financial or other.
3.   A negative image of Africa from the media as a whole. Already to be talking of ‘Africa’ without differentiation (one of my pet hates) shows how little the continent is known or promoted. The potential in Africa is fantastic. The hospitality in most countries puts us to shame. The landscapes are breath taking, the art and music phenomenal, the sunshine, food, colours, smells etc… all somehow deeper, brighter and fuller than what we normally experience in Europe. There is resilience, generosity, hospitality, joy, humour and a positive attitude in most African countries which puts us to shame.",Coffee,0,6,Phil_Schluter,6,False,1446478249,t1_cwlglwi,t5_2qhze,cwlne4l,t3_3r6vky,,1449549180,,0,

juveflair8,"Ferguson: “Patrice, two people are going to be great managers in this team. You and Ryan Giggs.”

Evra: “Come on, boss!”

Ferguson: “Patrice, trust me because you understand football, you know how to talk to people, you’ve got the leadership. Forget tactics and everything; you know how to pass on your passion. You can easily pass on your inspiration, your leadership. Trust me — do your badges.”

Evra, who was about to turn 32, had not considered management until then. Before that season had finished he was coaching academy players. Now in his second year at Juventus, Evra regards his concluding years as an elite-level player as an observation course in Serie A tactics and preparation. “I am like a computer, I’m trying to absorb everything.”

When Ferguson spoke, you listened. The way his captain tells it, there was no point arguing when a halt was called to a quarter-century at Old Trafford. “I remember we talked maybe two weeks before and he said, ‘Patrice, I will be here another five years’,” says Evra, laughing. “I said. ‘Yes, boss. Let’s do it.’ I was so convinced. He was looking younger and younger, amazing. He even told me ‘99%, Cristiano Ronaldo will come’. I was like, ‘Wow, we are ready to bounce back and to even win the Champions League again’.

“After that everyone knows what happened. You know when you are lost and you feel like the world is crumbling? It was a big trauma. I felt lost.”

Ferguson had been working with Ronaldo’s representatives to bring the forward back from Real Madrid, and Ronaldo wanted the move. The decision to retire, he explained to his players, was made after a family bereavement, the death of his wife’s twin sister.

A year later, Evra himself had to face the decision: stay or go. Much has been said about the Frenchman’s transfer to Juventus 59 days after United announced a one-year extension to his contract. The standard narrative is that the left-back was too old; that the inbound Louis van Gaal preferred Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind in his position.

One reason Evra requested our interview was to let United’s supporters know why he left. The delicacy of the departure, and a desire not to offend Juve fans in detailing the pain it caused him, made Evra wait more than a year before speaking. “First of all I didn’t want to hear about any club because my club was Manchester United,” he says. “We have to be clear about that.

“David Moyes had said to me, ‘I really want you to stay because you are my captain’. I explain, ‘But I have got a family problem and it will be difficult for me to stay’. After that I met [executive vice-chairman] Ed Woodward, ‘Patrice, I know your problem, your agent told me about it, but I can’t lose you. You are such an important figure at the club.’”

Evra, whose wife wished to leave England, thanked Woodward and requested some time to think. While he was on holiday United announced that contract extension. His deal included an option for another year, and the club exercised it.

“Juventus had already talked to me. The challenge was so exciting. [Juve coach Antonio] Conte had called me a lot during the World Cup. It was not difficult to go to Juventus, because it is such a big, historic club. But it was difficult to leave Manchester United.

“Ryan Giggs called me and said ‘Come on Patrice, if you want, you can talk with [Louis] Van Gaal’. I say, ‘OK, but I am really upset and let’s see.’ Ed Woodward called me and said again ‘Patrice, I am sorry. But you have to stay, I will give you another two years contract.’ I understood he had the club’s interests at heart. I didn’t know what to do.

“The president of Juventus, Andrea Agnelli, called me and said ‘Look, we didn’t put your contract to the Italian league, you can change your mind, but we really want you here’. And I feel somebody really wants me strongly, with a lot of respect.

“After that I speak with my wife and she was ready to go, so I call Ed Woodward to say, ‘I am sorry, I already gave my word to Juventus, I can’t go back’.”

The hardest moment came when Evra went to say his farewells to a touring United team in their Los Angeles hotel. “It was one of the worst days in my life. Finally I meet Van Gaal. ‘Patrice, nice to meet you, a lot of people talk so well about you. I really want you to stay.’ I say, ‘It’s too late...’ ‘No. I have got a lot of plans for you, for you to play centre-back sometimes. Play 3-5-2.’

“And again I was thinking ‘Oh, my God.’ That’s why I don’t want to blame anybody. The only person who takes the full responsibility why I leave Man United is myself. I am the one to make the choice.”

Evra remembers looking at himself in black-and-white stripes and asking what he was doing. For two months he felt unable to give all of himself to his new team.

Slowly he began to appreciate the benefits of a training regime that demanded more than double the hours he had put in at United, a medical team that resolved a long-term health problem, and an approach to tactical preparation unlike anything he had known in reaching four Champions League finals with Monaco and United.

“I didn’t expect this,” he says. “ I learnt a lot about a way to be more professional — even if I was already a massive professional in Manchester. I was sometimes thinking, ‘You win a lot of trophies for Manchester but you could have done much more if you had known the Italian way to play.’

“I always say the Premier League is like two boxers fighting. The one who is least strong gets tired, he goes down. Here it is like a chess game, and you have to understand every move before you play with your quality, your strength, your skill. That’s the difference.”

Evra’s first season added Serie A and Coppa Italia titles to his 10 major trophies at United, and he was in the Champions League final again in May. In September, Juve went to Manchester City, fell a goal behind, but left as winners. Serie A is poised to displace the Premier League in third place in the Uefa rankings. Is he surprised?

“No. I learn a lot, and I’m a little bit worried about English football. Why? In Europe, being fast, being strong, playing only with your quality, you are going to struggle against teams that prepare. That is where England has to work, it is about tactics. But it is not easy, because the players won’t accept it.

“When Juventus played Manchester City — and it was an extra bonus of course as an ex-Red — I was not worried. Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City, when they buy expensive players a lot of people say, ‘They should win, you see all the wages he got’. But this is not the football.

“When you play against Manchester City, did any player win the Champions League in their squad? Before the game I thought, ‘In Juventus, I’ve got three or four.’ It’s not like being arrogant, but it’s just, ‘I know what I’ve got in my bag, let’s go.’

“Then before the game it’s like going into the restaurant. I say to [Massimiliano] Allegri, the coach, ‘What is on the menu today?’ Because he gives you all the information. Against City, the way we came out from the back, it was really smooth, because we train every day like that.

“When I’ve got the ball I have three solutions, I have to choose the best one. In England sometimes you’ve got the ball and you have to create something with your own skill. But in Italy they don’t leave you time to create. Allegri always says, ‘If this door is closed why go through it? Go to the open door. If that one is closed again, pass the ball back, then you go to the other door.’ That’s their philosophy, and I’m so lucky to get all of this information.”

If his luck holds, one day Evra wishes to pass that information to Premier League players. He already has the master’s seal of approval.

archNew,"These are all good questions.

&gt;In what way did Columbus' discovery undermine the power of the church? 

European academic thinking was based on the assumption that everything there was to know was contained in the Bible and the writings of the Greeks and Romans. 

With the discovery of whole continents and peoples not mentioned in any of those works, people began to wonder what else they didn't know about. The fundamental assumptions being invalidated, other assumptions were broken down. The Protestant Reformations in the 16th century, while not directly caused by this shift in thinking (their roots are deeper), were aided by them. If the church was wrong about those land masses, what else did they get wrong? If they were getting these things wrong, what of our salvation?

&gt;In what way could a causal link between Columbus' discovery and the subjugation of Asia be established?

The reason the Iberians were going on sea voyages was to get around the Turkish monopoly of Asian trade. The Portuguese got to india in 1498 and opened trade posts. Between then and 1880 the Europeans kept pushing into Asian markets and came to dominate the whole region. 

With the discovery of America by the Spanish and the competition for resources it fueled, the European colonial powers fought very hard over Asia and Asian trade ports. 

&gt;In what way did it turn Africa into a battlefield?

Slavery has been a thing probably for a million years. African slavery was not much different than any other kind of slavery. Guys lose a battle, end up shackled and sold off for trade. In the 1450s the Portuguese began buying African slaves for their sugar plantations in the Atlantic. 

Columbus finding America opened up many places that were perfect for sugar plantations. With the native americans being wiped out by disease and not enough White laborers to do the work, the plantation owners bought some 12 million Africans between 1500 and 1880. I believe this is the largest human migration on record (not sure though, but it is one of the largest human migrations).

The way this turned Africa into a battle field is a two fold impact. 

First, the African slave dealers found demand spiking, especially after the 16th century sugar boom. Europeans were demanding more and more slaves, so the slave dealers began pushing slave catchers to find more slaves. This meant raids. Warrior groups wiped out more peaceful groups. European weapons were traded for slaves giving the warrior groups a greater edge. 

The forced shift in West African cultures toward warriors and the massive removal of millions of men, women, and children, explains part of it. 

The discovery of America shifted European politics in immeasurable ways, some of which I have mentioned. European competition in the 19th century lead to the Berlin Conference where Europeans divided up Africa into sections that they could conquer. 

For about 70 years, European colonial nations invaded and subjugated Africa, weakened by the slave trade and the warrior culture supported by that slave trade. 

&gt;Your causality is messed up.

I hope I cleared up your misunderstanding.

,"Yes, I am pretty old for a Redditor, and that $24 conversion rate was ridiculously outdated when I was a kid.  

Being not only old, but lazy, I am blatently stealing the text below from *Mental Floss*

&gt;Nineteenth century historians converted those 60 guilders to U.S. dollars and got what was then $24. That same figure has been repeated for almost two centuries since, frozen in time and untouched by changes to the value of currency—but those guilders don’t stand at $24 today. According to this converter from the International Institute of Social History at the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, 60 guilders in 1626 was equivalent to 734.77 euros in 2011. The exchange rate to the US dollar varies, but a conversion as I’m writing this gets us $951.08 USD, which puts us more in the ballpark.

&gt;While $951.08 is less of a steal than $24, there are still some other confounding factors to the deal. For one thing, Schagen’s letter does not mention who actually made the deal with the Dutch or the tribe on whose behalf it was sold, and the deed for the land has been lost. Without confirmation from a primary source, historians are left to infer who the island was purchased from, and can’t seem to agree.

,"I take it you're talking about the Ice armor/Frost Nova build with Parthan, at least with that build in mind I'll answer your points.

1. In a group you're a more traditional AoE DPS; you aggro a bunch of mobs, run back to the healer and simply mashing your Arcane strike and Blast. CC isn't crucial as it is in solo play, and your survivability comes from stacks and healing. 

2. In groups my downtime is still trivial. 3-4 seconds of Arcane Torrent and I'm back in form. I don't know what you mean by staying in sync.

3. That's simply a trade-off. The faster you kill the packs the more time you have with the boss.

4. I'm not sure I understand why this is a point. If a dmg buff isn't well spent on a wizard it doesn't mean the net DPS is going to suffer, it just means there's a different mechanic behind that DPS. If a SWK gets a huge damage buff, and Archon gets little, and their net DPS is the same, then it's a moot point.

I'm also working on solo gr65, and I do gr70 with friends. For survivabilty I find it poignant that I rarely ever die, even if the party gets wiped. That's without fleeing, I'll just turn on solo mode. What I've found is that you absolutely need some group flow. There has to be an agreement on size of packs, when to move on etc, and this is something you won't often find in randoms. But when you agree on, say, no elites and kite packs of ten, skip corridor maps, to me the Archon turns into a pretty traditional DPS that's able to punch a hole through the pack (literally).

When it comes to build and levels I therefore disagree. For me I used Delrasha up until 60, and Vyr's after that. 

I haven't tried out many variants closely enough to say anything about them, but a friend is running a Hydra build that has an enormous output. He's doing some theorycrafting, I'll ask him for the hard numbers. Personally I'll just use my solo spec until someone posts a proof of concept on youtube or something. 

If you're on an EU server I'd be very happy to game with you. I'm not trying to debate this to death, it's just that I've had the diametrically opposite experience with Vyr's.

,"&gt;How many sent their men, knowing their families will follow them soon after? 

Relatively few. It's sad how pervasive the idea is that the refugees are mostly young men. The distribution of Syrian refugee demographics typically mirrors the national identity: mostly female, the largest proportion being under 18.

The governments of Europe have been fairly strict on who it is accepting. Germany has an acceptance rate of 40%, and largely takes into account country of origin. For instance, Kosovo, Albania, and Serbia applicants are outright rejected. 

My research this year has been on the impacts of hosting nations, primarily Syria's neighbors. Prior literature about western world involvement gives a fairly good clue to the success and expediency of integration and assimilation.

Compare the refugee crises of Burundi (1993), Rwanda (1994) and Yugoslavia (1991). The first two had net positive effects on Northern Tanzania because of humanitarian aid creating infrastructure near refugee camps. Still, malnourishment and disease transmission rates were extremely high.

On the other hand, with the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Europe stepped up and absorbed most of the refugees without issue.

,"What agenda are you referring too? The one where we say lets compare two things that are completely different and try to find spurious correlations? 

I'm sorry, but if you want to spend you time figuratively shouting at plastic bags at the bus stop, please go ahead, but the only agenda free response is to look at facts. 

The US crisis in 2008 and the Eurozone crisis in 2010 were two completely different situations, with two different causes and two responses. They have linkage due to distressed credit conditions, but other than that it's like comparing a kebab to a a plum... yes, to the uneducated eye they are both food, but very different things.

The US crisis was caused by a sub prime mortgage crisis, and the Eurozone crisis caused by an attempt to shoehorn monetary policy and a single currency across a diverse economic block.

The US has shown growth but at the same time has favourably adjusted the way that GDP is calculated. Also employment data is still not consistent enough to lend credence to a rate raise from 0.25%. For perspective, when I started in this game, US rates were 5%. **Yes**, The Dow Jones made 37 all time record highs last year... That was not because of something magic happening in the US economy, but with interest rates so low investors are turned into forced buyers of risk ie stocks. **Yes**, the dollar is strengthening, but thats not because of an improving US economy. It's because during the recession and QE, when the dollar weakened, Emerging Market corporations took out close to $4trillion in dollar denominated debt that now needs to be paid back. Think about the mechanics... company has debt in USD. company earns money in roubles. Company needs to buy dollars and sell roubles to pay off debt...  

I'm not saying that the US is in a weak position, **but it is intellectually dishonest to pretend that it is an overtly strong economy**. 

The Eurozone is a very transparent situation. Structural adjustment policies have been forced upon Eurozone nations in order to synchronise their economies to Northern European standards, meaning that 'in theory' the impact of monetary policy shifts are unified across the continent.

Lets summarise this:

The US has made a concerted effort to recover, and are doing ok, but not an overtly convincing job.

The Europeans are using the crisis to make huge, previously unthinkable structural adjustments to its member state economies, and are experiencing choppy economic conditions as a result.

&gt; The ceremony Mina Salman Port in Bahrain comes as the UK is pushing to strengthen economic and military ties in the region, but has prompted outcry from human rights campaigners who say the ruling Al Khalifa family in Bahrain is overseeing an on-going crackdown on human rights and freedom of expression.

,"So let me explain what's going down with your post:

&gt; I tend to look at things from a point of view of how state powers work.

You take a stance that any adult following politics takes and assert it in a personal sense to explain how your views are not flawed, but insightful.

&gt; In this situation, namely the US instituted a coup in country X(Ukraine), 

The US did not institute a coup in Ukraine. That's incredibly self-centred for Americans to continue to buy into this guilt-trip, and denying Ukrainians their own abilities to chose for themselves anything beyond being a puppet for Moscow.

&gt; in order to take it away from Russia's sphere of influence

Ukraine sought to remove itself of it's own accord, just as Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria and Romania did. Oh, but these happened a long time ago, and non-Europeans forgot about them. It's ludicrous to assume shady G-Men are behind everything because Biden's son got a thank-you job in a privately owned oil firm.

&gt; Russia responded by creating instability and annexing a very important strategic location

Agreed.

&gt; (It definitely helps that the majority wanted this anyway).

Agreed, as did the endemic corruption and inefficiency in both the Ukrainian government and military.

&gt; Don't forget that NATO is a hostile military alliance in the end

Spin. NATO- is an apply-only defensive organization. It doesn't aggressively annex members. Putin has been their biggest ally in that. Hell, after Western nations helped the bankrupt Russia out with funding in the disastrous 90s (which, shockingly, we don't here so much about these days) NATO created the rapprochement centric [NATO-Russia Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO%E2%80%93Russia_relations#NATO.E2.80.93Russia_Council) to extend the hand to Russia. This Council was damaged after Russia invaded Georgia and suspended entirely after they invaded Ukraine. There are lines, and the Putin Administration happily stomped all over them while making no efforts to reciprocate methods of rapprochement while complaining about being ostracized.

,"I am curious how you justifiy this assertion:

&gt; ""Those countries have lower quality of care, and limit what care is available to their citizens.""

The limit might be true - I don't know if all other nations with governmental involvement limit or not.  However, it seems that those who judge such things such as the WHO disagree with the quality of care assertion:

We were ranked 37th, in 2000, which is disappointingly low imo.  Here is the actual WHO report: http://www.who.int/healthinfo/paper30.pdf



This report, on european health care quality is interesting:
http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2014/EHCI_2014_report.pdf

The Netherlands wins (by an easy margin) here are some of the observations of what the NL is doing right:

&gt; ""It has to be emphasized that the following discussion does contain a substantial amount of
&gt; speculation outside of what can actually be derived from the EHCI scores:
&gt; The NL is characterized by a multitude of health insurance providers acting in competition,
&gt; and being separate from caregivers/hospitals. Also, the NL probably has the best and most
&gt; structured arrangement for patient organisation participation in healthcare decision and
&gt; policymaking in Europe.
&gt; Also, the Dutch healthcare system has addressed one of its few traditional weak spots –
&gt; Accessibility – by setting up 160 primary care centres which have open surgeries 24 hours a
&gt; day, 7 days a week. Given the small size of the country, this should put an open clinic within
&gt; easy reach for anybody.
&gt; Here comes the speculation: one important net effect of the NL healthcare system structure
&gt; would be that healthcare operative decisions are taken, to an unusually high degree, by
&gt; medical professionals with patient co-participation. Financing agencies and healthcare
&gt; amateurs such as politicians and bureaucrats seem farther removed from operative
&gt; healthcare decisions in the NL than in almost any other European country. This could in itself
&gt; be a major reason behind the NL landslide victory in the EHCI 2014.""

&gt; 
&gt; I'd note this is a very accessible report and is a good read.  Here is an outtake of what the Dutch (NL) are doing wrong:
&gt; 
&gt; The “traditional” Dutch problem of mediocre scores for Waiting times has to a great extent
&gt; been rectified by 2014. As was observed by Siciliani &amp; Hurst of the OECD in 2003/2004, and
&gt; in the EHCI 2005 – 2014, waiting lists for specialist treatment, paradoxically, exist mainly in
&gt; countries having “GP gatekeeping” (the requirement of a referral from a primary care doctor
&gt; to see a specialist).
&gt; GP gatekeeping, a “cornerstone of the Dutch healthcare system” (said to the HCP by a
&gt; former Dutch Minister of Health) is widely believed to save costs, as well as providing a
&gt; continuum of care, which is certainly beneficial to the patient. As can be seen from the
&gt; references given in Section 8.10.2 on indicator 2.2, there is no evidence to support the costreducing
&gt; hypothesis. Also, as can be seen in Section 5.1, the NL has risen in healthcare
&gt; spend to actually having the highest per capita spend in Europe (outside of what the HCP
&gt; internally calls “the three rich bastards”; Norway, Switzerland and Luxembourg, who have a
&gt; GDP per capita in a class of their own). This was observed already in the EHCI 2009, and the

Rosettastone.com/English.  I know EU is poor, but come on at least invest in Rosetta Stone if you want to speak a first world language you barbarian

&gt;i myself would feel bad when i see all the teams in my region import players from other regions.

Best 2 players on Fnatic are Korean, wtf are you talking about?  Also, EU has 50 countries to recruit from, NA has 2.  Obviously NA would be way better if we had another 40+ countries to recruit from....  The USA has also been great at accepting trashy, dirty foreigners and turning them into better versions of themselves (see NYC in the early 1900s) so why stop now?

EU did just as good at worlds this year as NA did last year  Only rason that they made it to semis instead of quarters is because they had the luckiest brackewt of all time and didn't see a Korean team until semi-finals.  Then shit EU gets 0-6'd like its nothing.  Still a bad region whos only decent team gets carried by two Koreans, three if you count yellowstar

Sorry I don't understand what you mean by this.

&gt; Iraq Caused their own problems by starting sectarian warfare with each other. Not being able to govern each other respectfully and with competence not corruption.

We caused the downfall of Saddam Hussein by invading Iraq in an illegal war. Did we ever find those weapons of mass destruction that was used as an excuse for the invasion? Nope we didn't because they didn't exist. This illegal war which led to the sectarian violence currently gripping Iraq.

This is disputed but we (the UK) promised the Palestinians a homeland. A promise we subsequently reneged on see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration).

&gt; Winston Churchill did no wrong he was a great man fighting against the worst things that humanity has ever come up with. Did what needed to be done to protect the planet.

Really? Have you read anything about Churchill? He caused the disaster at Gallipoli in WWI. For which he was sacked as 1st Lord of the Admiralty. He [gassed](http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/sep/01/winston-churchill-shocking-use-chemical-weapons) the Kurds. He was also an advocate of bombing civilians during WWII - see the bombing of Dresden for an example.

I completely disagree with your conclusions about the bankers. They were/are immoral and corrupt. Their greed and short termist thinking led to the credit bubble that caused the crash of 2008. We have then had to bail them out using the public purse as they were 'too big to fail'. Really? Have we had any meaningful reform since the crash? No. Please show me these reforms you're on about.

The cost so far of quantitive easing and bailing out the banks is approximately is about [$22 trillion](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/financial-crisis-cost-gao_n_2687553.html) just in the US alone. And who is paying for it? Is it the banks? No, it's us. 

Banking deregulation? Pushed for by the bankers. Bankers who sponsor the Tory party. Warren Buffet one of the most successful investors ever called the deregulated banking industry's financial derivatives ['financial weapons of mass destruction'](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/2817995.stm) back in 2003.

I mean it's really not a stretch of the imagination for anyone familiar with his views, and they're all mentioned in that article as well as in masses of the commentary on his policies out there. 

It's also just patently obvious from his rhetoric, as I've already said -- his approach is to compare an imperfect world to a perfect world/nirvana, rather than be realistic and compare it to a slightly less imperfect world. 

It comes across in his policies as well. Everything is either currently dreadful, and he will make it perfect through his prescriptions.  

If we just nationalise this, and nationalise that, we can get to a perfectly beautiful world with growth and prosperity for all etc etc. It's daft.

The key bits from the argument you seem incapable of engaging with:

&gt;  In a paper from 1969, the American economist Harold Demsetz distinguished between two approaches to public policy: the “nirvana” approach, and the “comparative institution” approach. The former presents the choice as between an ideal norm and the imperfect existing arrangement; the latter as between alternative, real world arrangements, imperfect and less imperfect.

&gt; This is colloquially known as the “nirvana fallacy”: the tendency to assume that there is a perfect solution to a problem. A politician who uses the nirvana fallacy gains an easy rhetorical advantage. He can paint inspiring pictures of his perfect world, and attack the existing state of affairs for not living up to it. He can accuse anyone who doesn’t accept its plausibility as cynical, lacking in vision, or principle.

&gt; But this advantage comes at a cost, because the nirvana fallacy makes you stupid. It stops you from doing the hard, gritty thinking about how to improve the world we have, since, faced with a series of complex, imperfect options, you overleap them to reach the sunlit uplands of an ideal scenario. Soon, you forget how to think about the real world at all.

&gt; The left is particularly susceptible to this problem. Should we intervene in Syria? No, because we want a peaceful Middle East. Fine. That saves you the onerous work of confronting the truth that Syria is on fire, that hundreds of thousands have died there, and that many of the survivors are now pouring into Europe, and what the hell are we going to do about it?

&gt; Should we be making hard choices about public spending? No, because we want a high-growth economy in which only the rich pay more tax. Should we reform the way in which the NHS allocates resources, or schools are run? No, because we want a country in which everyone, regardless of background, receives the best healthcare and education, for free.

,"&gt; And you have to wonder, why didn't the Empire collapse with Palpatine's death like we all assumed would have? That's usually what happens with dictatorships.

To be fair, when the dictatorship is extremely large scale, things don't always collapse so cleanly.  

It does when there's an outside force conquering, but when the dictator just gets toppled by rebels, oftentimes there's a massive power grab.

When Alexander the Great died, his generals immediately power-grabbed as much as they could and his empire split in to four nations each run by a general.


In the Star Wars EU (the books, recently declared non-canon by Disney), that's exactly what happened: every regional governor and warlord either grabbed as much power as they could, or allied themselves with the most powerful guy on their block, and the Empire pretty quickly got shattered in to a bunch of mini-Empires.  This made things easy for the Rebels, since those mini-Empires would fight amongst themselves, and they spent a few years just mopping them up one by one.

(Ysanne Isard, head of Imperial Intelligence, grabbed the core systems like Coruscant and temporarily kept *most* of the Empire intact, but once they knocked her off and took Coruscant in the X-Wing trilogy, it was a free-for-all as there was no central government anymore.)

Within five years, the New Republic was dominant and most of the warlords were dead, but the remnants of the Empire (maybe 1/3rd the galaxy) got consolidated by the warlord that had won out the most (Grand Admiral Thrawn).  When they eventually knocked out Thrawn, Thrawn's second in command (Pellaeon) cleanly assumed command and the Empire continued as a centralized entity, albiet a third-rate power that spent the next 15 years slowly losing more and more star systems to the larger New Republic until they were eventually relegated to the corner of the galaxy and signed a surrender/peace treaty as a small state that wasn't particularly threatening.

So technically, in the Star Wars EU, even 25 years later there's still an ""Empire"", it's just too small and unimportant for anyone to care about it.",StarWars,0,1,NPPraxis,1,1446484524,1446484293,t1_cwipkda,t5_2qi4s,cwlrewl,t3_3qvj6w,,1449551075,,0,

    From: Visa Europe Corporate Communications
    Sent: Monday, November 2, 2015 1:26 PM
    To: Visa Europe Corporate Communications
    Subject: Visa Inc. to acquire Visa Europe - message from Nicolas Huss, CEO Visa Europe
     
    Visa Europe and Visa Inc. announced today (Monday 2 November 2015) their intention to create a single Visa. The Boards of both companies have been unanimous in their support of the deal, which values Visa Europe at €16.5 billion, with the potential for an additional earn out of up to €4.7 billion, for a total value up to €21.2 billion.
     
    The Board made its decision at a time when Visa Europe has delivered extremely strong growth, member satisfaction and financial results against a backdrop of increased competition, regulatory scrutiny and payments innovation. They believe that a global Visa will ensure we are best-placed for the future and will provide:

              ·        Greater access to resources for innovation and product development
    
              ·        Faster speed-to-market and stronger client-servicing
    
              ·        Ability to leverage Visa Inc.’s acquisitions across the payments value chain
    
              ·        Continued growth in local market resources.
    
     
    The world of payments is becoming more global, and scale is increasingly a source of competitive advantage. The nature of our customers’ business is changing, and we have begun to partner with global players and tech giants. Against a backdrop of a changing landscape, intensifying regulation and competition, there is no better time to come together as one company with greater depth, strength and scale.
     
    Visa Inc. has emphasised its intention to invest in and grow the European business, and has demonstrated, through the growth of Visa Inc. regions, the importance of maintaining a strong regional hub and local-market focus.
     
    This deal is an historic moment for Visa and our European members. When Visa Europe was created seven years ago, it was largely built from scratch, with the support of Visa Inc. and our members. Today, we begin the process of distributing €16.5bn and more to our members, a staggering figure, representing approximately 16 times Visa Europe qualifying fees. We are proud to be returning this value to our ecosystem, which has steadfastly supported us in our growth and development.
     
    I understand that you will have a number of questions regarding what this will mean for your business with Visa, and what happens next. Building your business remains our top priority, as well as our continued commitment to operate the highest levels of reliability, security and interoperability. 
    
    Next steps:
    Over the coming weeks we will be communicating with Principal and Group members asking you to sign and return a Letter of Transmittal and confirm legal contacts and bank account details so that we have accurate information to communicate the distribution of proceeds from the sale. We will also be contacting all shareholders of Visa Europe to advise how you redeem your share in the organisation.    
     
    If you have any questions about the announcement, please send them to:

    ·        Email: **********@visa.com
    
    OR :
    ·        Telephone: +44************
    
     
    I would like to thank you in advance for your patience and understanding, and look forward to working with your organisation as we move into a new and exciting era in Visa’s history.
     
    Kind regards

archNew,"&gt;That is not true. The Church wasn't unaware of, say, the printing press not being mentioned by neither the Greeks nor the Bible.

The Church used printing presses though. 

However, you miss the concept here. I am talking about worldly and supernatural knowledge, not technology. How the world is organized, not the daily operations of man kind. 


&gt;In that case, any discovery - geographical or otherwise - would do.

Yes. Any discovery of a fully unknown landmass. 

&gt;Considering that the Church never claimed there weren't other continents, they technically weren't wrong about this. 

This argument is backwards. The Church said words to the effect of ""This is ALL there is"". 

If you look at the T-O maps that list only three continents. This is pretty much solid examples saying, ""This is all there is, this is God's creation.""

&gt;Either case, I've never read Luther - or any other influential Protestant - make the connection.

As I said before, If the Church was wrong about how God made the world, perhaps the Church is wrong about how to save our souls. Luther and Calvin both use the Bible to point out that the Church is in violation of what they claim God wants. Now that the Church's authority is broken (along with Political considerations in the Holy Roman Empire), people are willing to give Luther more support than they had for previous reformers. 

&gt;That's a massive leap. The sea trade with Asia began in the 15th century, but Europe wasn't even close to dominating major parts of Asia until the 18th century, and it was in no way reliant on the discovery of the Americas.

The colonization and Conquest of the Americas gave the Spanish the silver needed to open up ports in the Philippines. It pushed Dutch, English, and French merchants into the East to compete for the trade. 

The conquest of the Americas required better shipping and forced the great European powers into more intense competition and provided them more resources that aided them in their conquest of the East. 

&gt;Arguably, this would have happened either way. If there are profits to be made from violent competition, those profits will be had regardless of the existence of the Americas.

Consider the English. They conquered the Eastern bit of North America against Native Americans who only had any success when the colonists were few in numbers. The English grew strong from the economic resources gained through these Colonies that allowed them to rival and then surpass, those countries in asia. How would they have gotten the resources to do that without the Americas to provide it? 

As stated previously, the Silver and Gold in the new world funded Spanish global exploration and drove the others in Europe to colonize and expand. 

Without the Americas, I can't fathom a way for europe to catch up to east or west asia, let alone Sub Saharan Africa. 

&gt;A side note, but depending on what estimates you use, I believe the partition of India provoked a larger mass migration.

That's why I couched this with ""I believe"". 

&gt;This is a fair point, although there is a lively scholarly debate regarding the demographic and economic effects of the slave trade on Africa.

The specifics, maybe, but how do you get away from the militarization of Africa? Any group that was not militant was captured and sold.

I can't speak with certainty on the behalf of someone I've never met and I'm sorry you had an unpleasant experience, but there's a very real chance that she simply felt nervous, perhaps considering whether she should switch to English which she might not feel comfortable doing.

0025,"My opinion is that this totally depends on the version used. EU Grievous, with his ability to defeat entire groups of Jedi with force-enhanced reflexes and speed, and slight pre-cog at once probably wins. 

Movie Greivous, using the feats we've seen on screen, gets beaten solidly. With the exception of his rotating arms he used at the beginning of his duel with Kenobi, he isn't even FTE. no way he could keep up with Drizzt, and you're right that Drizzt has handled more swords that that before.

I would say that while the Marilith almost certainly has better than human physicals, it might not be stronger than Grievous. Its strength isn't ever mentioned in text, while opponents who *are* significantly stronger than Drizzt usually get mentioned. Meanwhile, even movie Grievous was able to throw Kenobi around with one arm, leap great distances, and crack a spaceship window with physical fore, unless I'm remembering drastically wrong.

no-knight,"The United states has never had a higher GDP, productivity is up, overall wealth is up. Yet you admit you are being crushed by debt. Why? Taxes on the uppermost wage and interest earners in this country has gone down. One of the first things to get cut is education. With less and less taxes going into the system, middle class workers are forced to take on the burden of going to school. Who benefits from this schooling? Surely the worker, but also the corporations, some of which are now seeing they want top quality workers and are themselves helping to support business schools and put money back into the system. However, it falls short. You benefit from your education, but so too do we all. I'm glad you went to college, our country is better for it. In fact, I am willing to forgo a little bit of my money so the next generation also gets to have an education. Except the top bracket isn't pulling their fair share anymore. I don't just watch cable news, I'm giving my perspective, you don't have to agree with it. Just understand that as productivity of the average worker has gone up, all the increased wealth of the system has not gone to us, it has been siphoned off by the top 1%. They take a share to which they are not entitled. How? They figured out that of they buy one party entirely to dismantle unions over a few decades, the American worker is in a position where they cannot bargain for better wages. It's a very simple and effective plan, and it has worked. In addition, they own the media companies which rarely talk about the plight of the middle class. So the conversation isn't happening and they can just ignore it. Now 51% of wage earners earn under 30000 a year. Adjusted for inflation, that is the highest percent in that category in modern history. It is no coincidence, that as that has happened, all the wealth in this country has been accumulated by the top few percent. Schools are in disrepair, and money is being siphoned away from those schools in private vouchers that are unneeded by the wealthier and likely violates the separation of church and state. Bridges are getting their lowest ratings for safety ever and are not being updated. We have fallen behind Europe and modern Asian countries in infrastructure, Korea has 1TB internet speeds for about the same cost. It's all been a racket. These problems are solvable, and the group that has collected all the increases in wealth for the past 30 years do owe back some of what they have collected off our backs.

Also known as MBOMBO, MBONGO
Mighty Creator God of Vomit

From the Bushongo in the Congo comes BUMBA, the African Creator God of Vomit. Yes, vomit.

In the beginning, all was dark. Then out of the darkness came BUMBA, a giant pale-skinned figure. He was not feeling well. In fact he had not been feeling well for millions of years. He was lonely, and the unbearable solitude was making him ill.

Troubled by a ballooning bellyache, he staggered, moaned and vomited up the Sun. Light burst forth into the Universe — and he choked out the Moon. The stars came next and then, with a tremendous effort, he threw up the planet Earth. We do live in a very sick world.

This nauseating display was brought to a triumphant conclusion when, as an encore, he vomited forth nine animals, an assortment of humans, and a pile of diced carrots.

Exhausted from his labors, he sat and watched as the nine creatures multiplied. After a while, they had evolved into every living thing on Earth.

,"The horned helms was NOT a Nazi invention. 

The horned helm imagery was inspired by Bronze Age ceremonial helms [like this](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/pix/horned_helmet_vikso.jpg). There is imagery from the period that shows it being used in a ceremonial manner in [the Oseberg tapestry with a figure with a horned helmet leading the procession](http://www.medievalhistories.com/wp-content/uploads/oseberg-tapestry-original-drawing.jpg?57f6e6). Horned figures are also found on one of the Sutton Hoo [helmet panels](http://archeurope.eu/uploads/images/Anglo-Saxon/Sutton_Hoo/helmet/plate_2_l.jpg) and [other finds from Vendel Period Sweden](http://www.ealdfaeder.org/imy/spearsource.jpg).  While the imagery exists that there were horned hats, the evidence for period helmets of war include [the Gjermundbu helmet](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Vikinghjelm,_Gjermundbu.jpg) but also images from [Bayeux Tapestry](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Odo_bayeux_tapestry.png) and [Life of St.Aubin](http://i1381.photobucket.com/albums/ah223/druzhina3/11/Aubin-Vikings-11C.jpg~original) show the use of a spangenhelm with a nose guard for helmets for war.

The reason horned helmets became an image of the Viking warrior is because of Richard Wagner's Ring cycle and the iconography he gave for the Norse gods in the play. Here is and image of [Wotan (Odin)](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2f/05/70/2f05708605d4a9d2ecd1af8fae49f343.jpg) from early showings of one of the ""Ring"" operas.  They used horned looking helmets to denote the divinity of the character on stage so the character could be easily identified on stage.  Wagner was probably inspired by the artifacts and used his artistic licence to put them on his characters. This tie manifested through with the rings imagery and an idea of putting horns on ""barbarous"" Vikings to make them look more fierce and mean. 

Now Nazi propaganda was keen to these finds. SS recruitment posters (such as [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/06/d1/8c/06d18c5d14268c0476c360a48ffe63e4.jpg) and [this](http://orig10.deviantart.net/4d6a/f/2012/208/0/9/ss_recruitment_poster_8_scandinavia_by_lordautocrat-d58rq2f.jpg)) for Norway heavily use Viking imagery to encourage recruitment for Norwegians to fight for the future of the ""Aryan race"" in the SS.  As you can see, no horned helmets, and if you can find a piece of Nazi media that ties Vikings to horned helmets, I'd like to see it.

Some notes about horned helmets and their practicality in war are also a reason to know why they just didn't exist.  Look at one of the most iconic and common of Norse weaponry: the axe. You have the [bearded-axe](http://media.liveauctiongroup.net/i/13557/13838551_1.jpg?v=8CF59AD9CFD75C0) and the [dane axe (The big axe the dude is holding)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Tapisserie_agriculture.JPG)  Both of these axes have a hook on them which was great for pulling shields aside to make a gap in shield-walls as well as for hooking behind the neck or the ankles of an enemy to make them fall to the ground for easy vanquishing of enemies. Now helmets, if you were lucky to have one in the day, needed to be strapped to the head or else they shift around and can fall off. A man wearing a horned helmet strapped to the head would mean a very easy target to hook your axe onto to drag that persons face to the ground.  The helmets were made conical and smooth so head hits glance down and off the head, attaching anything to the helmet makes it a liability more than armor.

Rent controls are not a good idea.

EDIT: TO GET THE JOKE IN THE COMMENTS BELOW PRETEND I HAVEN'T WRITTEN THE REST OF THIS COMMENT

Supply controls on a supply problem isn't going to alleviate the supply problem. At best rent controls benefit those already in accommodation, and especially those in the most desirable accommodation. Stockholm is an awful example of working rent controls, see:

""Household allocation and spatial distribution in a market under (“soft”) rent control"" (2013).

,"Help for what? Literacy?

You want me to read less?

To you, the world is a ""random place"" with no activists, lobbying groups or policy think-tanks. Events happen spontaneously. And with no help or guidance from governments or corporations, right? (Like the Syrian refugees in Germany. Angela Merkel isn't stewarding the process, right? It's just spontaneously happening?)

It just all ""randomly occurs,"" am I correct?

And when the international news runs quotes from activists calling for the ethnic cleansing of Europe, and saying that Norway ""is too dangerously white"" I should delete those from my mind.

Ignorance is bliss, right?

(Unlike people of your caliber, I'm consistent. I decried the ethnic cleansing of aboriginal people in Peru. I likewise called out African genocide in South Sudan and Somalia. Why am I supposed to think that calls for ethnically cleansing Europe are acceptable? Why, because the future populations marked for replacement are white? Their skin color is supposed to make it acceptable. That's racist as hell.)

And I will not submit to that brand of racism.

Unlike most globalists, I don't lose sleep at night that Norway is filled with Norwegians. I don't toss and turn, bothered that Zimbabwe has a majority-black population. I don't writhe in agony that China is populated by Asians.

It would be the worst sort of bigotry (in my estimation) to show up in China and say, ""China is too dangerously Chinese. We need to pipeline Swedes into your country to bring you up to code with globalist ideas of multi-culturalism.""

When I travel to Japan, I demonstrate respect for their culture, traditions and population. My first act in their country isn't to say how much I hate it, and how wouldn't it be great if I got to demographically alter it.

Why wouldn't I alter it? Because I love people for who they are. I don't engage in the hatred of them that is at the bottom of calls for ethnically cleansing them from their own country.

I don't live my life around hatred of different peoples and cultures. I don't have an abiding God-complex that it's my right to change them.

So I would suggest, on the contrary, that you seek help. Get a therapist to help you explore your hatred of the West. And why you think it must be radically altered. Ask the psychiatrist why you don't have the same impulse to alter Zimbabwe or Saudi Arabia. Why just the West?

,"A few things to add to the list:

- Scout the region extensively
- Initiate diplomatic and trading relations with some tribes, do this to A) get some off your back, B) set the tribes against each other and C) introduce damaging goods like narcotics. All of these were done by European empires at some point
- Move in workers and settlers. It helps to claim a region by settling it when you can. Having workers around creates a local economy meaning the forward base is less dependant on supply lines

Beyond that I'd say you need to focus less on resource acquisition early on and more on becoming firmly secure. This means that a lot of materials are going to be shipped in with the first wave and plenty more once a better supply line is opened up via rail. Only then when you have something really developed would it be good to set up further bases at resource locations. The phases I'd use would be:

1) Scouting. Create maps of the region, identify resources, strategic sites and tribal positions. Also open up limited relations with some tribes by sending in merchants. These are to gain trust and scout local politics, particularly looking for old scores to settle.

2) Set up base in Earnest. Plenty of troops and workers. Clearing forest is difficult so look for a largely empty area that is strategically strong (i.e. a hill top) with water access nearby. Build fortifications and expand into forest as needed. At the same time continue limited trade. On basis of what is learnt stoke the fire of rivalry between the tribes up to and including trading obsolete (from your perspective) weaponry. A tribe armed with muskets is a marginal increase in threat to you if you have semi-automatics but a huge increase in threat over other tribes.

3) Further develop base, not only fully fortified but ready for local economic expansion. Stockpiles of tools, local forges/factories, early farms laid down etc. Set up research posts for dealing with local biological concerns (infection and fauna). Aim to complete railway soon. Begin limited exploitation of local resources. Aim to have some tribes as military allies (you can kill them later but it helps if they are doing fighting for you) and fight only when necessary.

4) With resources bases up and running along with the railway begin importing more workers, soldiers and supplies and export resources. The original base should be a well developed fortress town. Fighting against the tribes can begin in earnest now that positions are well secured (including cutting roads/rail into the forest to key positions).",worldbuilding,0,2,Zakalwen,2,False,1446488234,t3_3r7vwf,t5_2rd6n,cwlu75u,t3_3r7vwf,,1449552452,,0,

eng-GreaterLondon,"&gt;Internet and social media companies will be banned from putting customer communications beyond their own reach under new laws to be unveiled on Wednesday. 

&gt;Companies such as Apple, Google and others will no longer be able to offer encryption so advanced that even they cannot decipher it when asked to, the Daily Telegraph can disclose. 

What this is saying is that companies cannot intentionally create secured channels and then instantly throw away the keys to unlock them. This is in line with existing legislation which says you must hand over passwords and encryption keys or face jail. That legislation was stupid in the first place and this is bad too; it assumes malice when ignorance and entropy are very possible alternatives.

This presents a security flaw for every piece of software which relies on disposable rotating key pairs as all of the used pairs will need to be stored for posterity. It's trival to reverse engineer the algo used to generate the key pair pass (and then preempt the next one) when you have a long chain of both sets of keys. Diffie Hellman doesn't help here.

This legislation is unworkable and a threat to data security in the UK (Without having read the text of the legislation of course...). A lazy piece of legislation trying to put the genie back in the bottle. Not to mention this does nothing to protect citizens and makes us vulnerable to spying, as if that wasn't obvious. It's hard not to think of the government treating the population like enemies that have to be thwarted rather than citizens who must be served.

&gt;However, proposals to be published on Wednesday will, for the first time, place a duty on companies to be able to access their customer data in law. 

That's just going to drive people to use services from the EU / outside of the EU who do not have to comply with this nonsense. I expect it to be made illegal to procure services such as this (bye bye secure VPNs).

&gt;""It's not a safe space for them to communicate on a fixed line telephone or a mobile phone, we shouldn't allow the internet to be a safe space for them to communicate and do bad things."" 

You first Cameron. Start small; transparency in the ownership of UK property. Then big; complete transparency in government matters. Put your money where your mouth is and maybe we won't think this shit is complete hypocrisy.

&gt;“They have enough difficulty finding the guilty. No-one has produced any evidence of casual curiosity on part of the security services.""

,"I think the novelizations seem to describe the movies scenes quite differently than what actually happens in the movie, and should be taken with a grain of salt. For example the novelization of Mace vs. Sideous describes their fight as lightspeed and super FTE: 

&gt;Mace pressed back the darkness with a relentless straight-ahead march; his own blade, that distinctive amethyst blaze that had been the final sight of so many evil beings across the galaxy, made a haze of its own: an oblate sphere of purple fire within which there seemed to be dozens of swords slashing in all directions at once.
The shadow he fought, that blur of speed—could that be Palpatine? 
Their blades flared and flashed, crashing together with bursts of fire, weaving nets of killing energy in exchanges so fast that Anakin could not truly see them—but he could feel them in the Force. The Force itself roiled and burst and crashed around them, boiling with power and lightspeed ricochets of lethal intent. And it was darkening.

Even if their speeds are this fast in other EU, I still don't think the novels should supercede the movies in terms of feats, because the moviesl are the main canon, and everything else will be secondary to it.

,"I can imagine that the Germans didn't drop bombs on German cities, but you never know!

What the heck, I'm going to ^^[shittily] research this.

Let's first decide whether it was theoretically possible for the Axis to have bombed a Dusseldorf, a German city.

[The US army captured Dusseldorf on April 17, 1945.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhr_Pocket) Apparently, this ""marked the end of organized Nazi resistance in the Western front."" It also appears that the Allies achieved serious air superiority in western Europe in mid-to-late-1944, and so, with the Luftwafa destroyed, there was little Germany could do to bomb the occupying Allied forces in Dusseldorf. I am not finding any evidence to the contrary, either.

So, who, among the Allies, bombed Dusseldorf during WWII: [Wiki: Bombing of Germany during World War II](http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Germany_during_World_War_II)

Fascinatingly, of the Allies, only the RAF bombed Dusseldorf throughout the entirety of the war, according to that Wikipedia page. So, we can look around to see what 250 kg (551 lb) bombs the RAF had in its arsenal. Assuming this was not a cluster bomb or an armor-piercing round, it looks like this was a [General Purpose bomb, or the GP bomb's predecessor.](http://www.wwiiequipment.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=100:50lb-120lb-250lb-500lb-general-purpose-bombs&amp;catid=43:bombs&amp;Itemid=60) I will also assume this article is a little bit off on the bomb size because Britain switched to metric *after* WWII; we are actually looking for a bomb listed in pounds, not as a clean ""250 kg."" So this looks like it was either a 500 lb General Purpose Bomb or a 500 lb MC if it was produced after 1942.

Here's what the bombs look like in a nice graphic format:

[500 lb General Purpose Bomb](http://www.clavework-graphics.co.uk/products/prints/Bristol/Blenheim_Load_2.jpg)

[500 lb MC](http://www.clavework-graphics.co.uk/products/prints/Handley_Page/Halifax_Load_3.jpg)

Perhaps we can get a better guess at what bomb it was by checking bombing dates in relation to the 1942 500 lb GPB–500 lb MC production switchover date. So, when was Dusseldorf bombed? 3 times before 1942 and 11 times after 1942. I am sure there was a remaining stock of 500 lb GPB's that would last past the official 1942 production switchover, so this does not prove that it was more likely to be a 500 lb MC, though.

**Edit:** Although I am talking to myself at this point, I found what appears to be [an actual picture of the bomb itself!](http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/199891/) Based on the cylindrical rather than curved shape, this looks like an MC!

**Edit:** IBTimes really sucks. Multiple sources are saying it was a [275 lb bomb, not a 250 kg bomb.](http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/1.683717) However, this still appears to be wrong--Britain did not have 275 lb bombs during WWII. However, they still dropped *250* lb GPB's and MC's. The production shift year was still 1942.

I pointed out that the claim that the government is the single biggest polluter is (a) true and (b) meaningless. That's got to count for something.

I showed that your claim that property rights = less pollution can be interpreted a number of ways (social democracy = less pollution, big government = less pollution, being in Europe = less pollution).

You see, I believe that sometimes the government can do good and sometimes no. There seems to be this belief among the more libertarian minded that those who are not libertarians believe that the government is always 100% right and the solution to any problem is more government. That is not the case.

There are still plenty of cases where private businesses polluted rivers and streams and lakes and air and that pollution has gone *way* down since the Clean Air and Water Act.

&gt; Where? It certainly isn't here in Scandinavia! As a Danish person of Finnish heritage I can tell you that very few people are confused about the terms.

You are correct in the fact that here in the Nordic countries we do not often refer to Finland as a part of Scandinavia, however, in the rest of the world, they do, thus making the term 'Scandinavia' synonymous with 'The Nordic Countries' when speaking to an international audience.

&gt;Finland is in a totally different league with their uralic language and non-viking past.

Scandinavian languages has been spoken in what is now Finland for more than a millennia, and is still spoken, I'm one of them.
As for the non-viking past, more and more evidence for viking presence in what is now Finland emerges every year. One can now with some certainty claim that vikings were in Finland.

,"&gt; a recently promoted small side

That's a tad misleading.

Size wise, yes Stabaek are on the small side as far Tippeligaen sides go but performance wise it's a different story.

Stabaek were consistently a top 5 Norwegian side through out the 90s/early 00's and played in European competition on multiple occasions. They inexplicably fell into relegation in 2004 for one season and were back up in 2006.  2007-2009 was their best run of form ever and they finished 2nd, 1st, 3rd in the Tipp, nearly winning the double in '08. 

2010 - 2013 they fell off again where they finished 12th, 10th, 16th (relegated) and 2nd (promoted).  

What Bradley's done since coming in in 2014 is he has stabilized them (9th in 2014) and got them back to being real competitors.  

Not trying to take away from what he's done as this year is definitely a big accomplishment for both him and the club but calling a club that's played in the top flight 19 of the last 22 seasons ""recently promoted side"" doesn't exactly portray their recent history.

,"&gt; Is this legal situation so firm that doctors and clinics are willing to advertise and offer abortion services in the first trimester?

I've seen advertisement along the way of ""pregnant - and nobody is supposed to know it"" (so a very intimate way). I only did a cursory read, but it involves a mandatory counseling and 3 day wait period after it. Also, regardless of delivery or abortion, you have the right to a counseling talk afterwards. If you decide to abort in the first trimester (not out of medical reasons etc), you'd have to carry the cost yourself, about 300-400€ depending on method. If you don't have the money, you will qualify for assistance and the government will carry the cost.

In regards to advertise and offer: Everybody going through our school system has mandatory sex ed at least twice, once cursory in primary school and then, very in depth in biology in secondary school. I remember from my class that it was at least quarter of a year (2 lessons a week) and talked about everything, including unwanted pregnancy (very cringe worthy dialog we had to play out), all types contraceptives, pros and cons, plan b (morning after pill), abortion was included as well.

Everytime I read about protests in america in front abortion clinics, I feel very sorry for the women that have to go through that. I've never heard about that here, and it most likely will result in a huge scandal. But then again, europe is way less religious and even the people that are don't push it in your face.

&gt; ""pursuit of happiness""

In criminal matters, you would've been able to get an abortion regardless. The sentence was back in the seventies, and afterwards, the doctors were very lenient (this was before the de facto law of first trimester abortions) and allowed abortion on grounds of low income or if you are jobless.

I've asked a friend of mine (nurse), and she told me: There is a lot of things to consider, but once you go through them, you should be able to get an appointment in two weeks (after mandatory counseling and wait period).

It is simply an easy way to keep track of everything and keep points seperate. I guess I will stop trying to format things to be easier to follow.

You talk about how you prefered the ad campaign that shows very little, and yet claim that the game story is shallow, and that an ad vmxampaign should not be able to spoil anything. What are you comparing it too? If you go to the original Halo only two things are revealed in the entire game, and no back story or character development exists anywhere aside from strong silent type + cheeky side kick find space zombie and a weapon that will destroy the galaxy. Is that the story you would prefer? 

The one we got started showing that what Halsey did bothered MC. You see him really trying to push Cortana's buttons by asking how many people she had to kill, and whether she wanted to end up as halsey. He was hesitating. Testing her to see if there was anything salvageable left, or if she was just a rampant shell of the Cortana he knew.

The game also brings up an interesting dillema. What about the Smart AI? They are basically sentient being that we have created as slaves to perform only a specific tasks, doomed to die after 7 years, and programmed with kill switches in case they decide they don't want to navigate any more. No one has said anything about it in the games yet, but it is a deep point that Roland really put into words well.

&gt;You created her Doc, Why is cortana the problem? Because she refused to die when she was supposed to?

Why is Halsey so bent on Cortana being destroyed instead captured, saved, or convinced to stand down to study? She is fiercely defensive of her spartans, but when it comes to the AI she created from a flash clone of her own brain, she wants to kill it with fire. What does she know?

When it comes to the statement that it is just another generic AI story I tentatively disagree. It has the potential to get quite a bit deeper.

Humans have the reclaimer geas because the Librarian imprinted humans. Humans were imprinted with the subconscious knowledge to create Smart AI. Smart AI are created from human brain substrates which consumes the brain to create the AI. The librarians counter parts were able to transcribe humans in a similar way over 100,000 years ago and retain the geas.

It could be entirely possible that the reclaimer geas could lie dormant in Smart AIs much like the immunity of the composer lies dormant in humans as well.

Why was developing smart AI and Mjolnir suits so important that it was imprinted on our very genetic code? Maybe humans were not meant to bare the mantle alone in the librarians plan. Maybe we were only given the status of reclaimer as a temporary measure incase we managed to discover the flood before we created Smart AI. 

It would not be a huge logic leap to think that an AI would be a better bearer of the mantle than a biological human. They would be able to rest the flood longer after all. Not forever as Mendicant Bias demonstrates, but for a while.

Or at least a Rampant AI may be able to convince itself this is true as it won't spare the clock cycles to convince itself otherwise.

There is a lot of potential with the AI thinking, wanting, or actually being an intended holder of the mantle.

The development MC saw between admitting cortana is gone, and holding up Halsey as Space Himmler when talking to cortana is more development than his character saw in all 4 other halo games combined. 

All he has been is the resolute military machine with only one goal in mind. Save everyone. This never faulters. He tries to activate the halo to save everyone. Then he is told not to so he does not. He stands in line for an award (in armor for some reason that makes no sense what so ever) when Cairo is attacked. MC save the station! He saves the station. Save the earth! He saves the earth. Go get that thing back! He goes to get the thing. Blow up the ring dispenser by activating a new ring! He blows up the ring dispenser with another ring.

If cracking a wry joke 2 or 3 times per game was considered character development, osiris team would be developed as fuck, with buck being the lead of the entire series.

As for blue team, they are not friends. Not even close. What they have is something else. This transfers to communication. They don't have to talk to know what the others are doing. They have known each other for almost 40 years. What are they supposed to discuss? They flow john. Period. No matter what.

That stoic approach to everything is integral to who they are, who they were trained to be. It is one of the things that sets them apart from the Spartan IVs. You also have to remember these kids were basically abused and tortured for 10 straight years, then they killed half of them. Blue team specifically then went on to perform more operations and campaigns that any other group ever. And they did all of it, save for the events at the open of Halo CE, together. What is left to talk about?

You are tired of the worthless argument that halo 5 is SIMILAR (i never said the same) in that many of the complaints are very similar.

I, on the other hand, am sick of the worthless argument that the story was shallow because there was not enough fan service from one particular character or another. Much of what is being requested/demanded would put characters way out of character. This argument also ignores a lot of the discussion of fair treatment of AI, what happens to Halsey if the only people that would defend her speak out against her? What if the succession of the mantle is more complicated than just humans, period. Why would we be trusted with it in the end anyway if we always end up so warlike and devoted to destruction.

Exploring the possibility that Humanity was not meant to be the final bearer of the mantle would require more exploration of the super ancient lore of the Halo universe.

The rebelling colonies still matter for a few reasons. Remember, the Spartan IIs were created from children kidnapped from the colonies, and were created specifically to keep them in line. The covenant coming around just put the rebels into a position where they had to shut the fuck up and get in line if they wanted any sort of alliance help with defense, relief, etc. Now that the covenant is not much of an issue they are getting squirrely again. That and even in Nightfall the rebels really wanted nothing to do with the UNSC even though they are there to 'help'.

This is begining to show through some more when Team Osiris is obviously shaken by the fact that a frontier world that had already suffered at least one devestating attack, was in the midst of another attack by another alien race. Why would it be so strange that a colony would be allowed to defend themselves? Things are not ok between the colonies and the UNSC/ONI.

Paying attention to the colonies and digging into whether halsey is going to be considered a war criminal or not is exactly what should happen if we want to keep the EU relevant. I mean, how is exploring the relationship between the colonies, UNSC, blue team, and Halsey not relevant? It is the only backstory blue team has outside of war.

Ahead there is a good chance that we are going to see awkward alliances with those rebels form to deal with the Cortana threat. I mean, who else would have gear hidden away specifically hidden or hardened with UNSC Smart AI in mind?

I guess I am not looking at what the game explained and closed out, but am looking at the windows that have been opened for not only the next game, but for the EU as well.",halo,1,0,TheHaleStorm,0,False,1446492746,t1_cwlu9k0,t5_2qixk,cwlxfwl,t3_3r6ujb,,1449553980,,0,

,"I was having a think about this the other day, and I think the aftermath of the Dominion war provides fertile ground to address topical issues of today.

Put simply, the Federation is the EU, Romulus has been destroyed, Cardassia is repeatedly failing to form a stable government - Syria and Iraq - and the Dominion's member races, emboldened by the defeat in the alpha quadrant have started to rebel, prompting fierce retaliations and posturing - USSR/modern Russia. 

The net effect is that the Federation is facing refugees pouring over several borders. Between resource shortages along the refugee trail, changelings and extremists amid the horde, and Romulan power struggles wreaking havoc, the citizens and member worlds of the Federation start to feel the strain and the paranoia. 

Meanwhile the Klingons can flip their historical analogue, and become the US. They're stirring up the chaos to secure resources in the name of security and honour. The tech that allowed them to survive the Breen weapons is primitive and damaging to subspace, but the warrior culture which has become increasingly corrupt and farcical is suppressing scientific advancement.

Star Trek can once again mirror the current crises, and, most importantly, provide good moral example in the face of chaos and ambiguity.

Refugees are, on the whole, decent people in desperate situations. Klingons are, on the whole, fine folks, with some odd customs and idiotic, self interested, and conflicted leadership. The people of the Federation have their hearts in the right place, but how far does their generosity stretch when the galaxy is on their doorstep? How harmonious can the federation council remain when the core worlds cannot fathom the events on the frontier?

SWIT,"I agree! The EU is only *one* possible way of pursuing the European Project (namely through a single one-size-for-all supranational system); but despite what so many europhiles believe, it doesn't have to be the only one.

Let's be honest, Europe has never been completely unified - ever. Many Empires reigned over significant chunks of it at different times, but they never controlled every last corner, and were often times forced to fight for control in a way we would today find completely unacceptable and anti-democratic. It's completely unrealistic to think we will be able to be all united while at the same time keeping our humanistic and democratic philosophies without generating significant (possibly insurmountable) internal tensions.

IMHO, Europe should rather be a community of communities. We should come together at the national level in smaller, like-minded sub-communities (Nordic Council, V4, Benelux, CEFTA, EFTA, etc); with a super-supra-national continental framework that would regulate how the sub-communities interact with each other. This framework would harbour institutions designed to encourage harmonizations of regulations, administrative processes and standards across all the sub-communities wherever possible, but still in a non-binding way. EURATOM and the Council of Europe could also fit there.

That way, each country could join the sub-community which caters to their situation best. If for example France, Germany and Italy really want to follow the supranational route and form a mini-EU with a single currency, they still could. If one of them feels it isn't democratic enough or doesn't work as intended, they could join another sub-community, without leaving the over-arching European framework. Plus, negotiating treaties and finding consensuses in smaller groups of countries is much easier.

Edit: apparently also signing foreign trade agreements 

&gt; precisely because of the EU’s enormous size, the third party may be wary of opening up its markets for fear of what this might do to its domestic industries. In this regard, it is interesting that Switzerland has managed to sign a favourable trade agreement with Japan, a country with which the EU has still not secured a deal.

,"Essentially we have the politicians we deserve, they are competent enough to solve the current problems  problems, but not competent to prevent themselves from causing the next ones. By and large both governments were cooperating(SD excluded) and their strategies are very similar and both ideologies work long term. So its hard to say which are more competent, there is a crippling lack of engineers, and scientists on both sides, and most economists are too corrupted by their ideology. Personally: I already have pretty much everything I want, so I prefer a large welfare state. The lower growth is a small price to pay for the stable, low crime, democratic, egalitarian society that results( if done right!) and it will deal much better with the massive job losses that will occur due to automation in the near future.  In practice however I hope the major parties will continue to cooperate rather than go to either extreme, the efficient cooperation between parties in sweden has historically been a great asset, a suboptimal solution at the right time, is much better than a optimal one 3 elections later after all.  

Borg stands out as exceptionally competent, but there are competent people all over the government. The real problem lies in the short term, public perception driven, or pure ideology driven actions of politicians of both parties. The social democrats caused the inefficiencies which needed to be addressed and are still to spend happy on plenty of bullshit, but in their ideologically motivated drive to privatize various infrastructures the alliance severely damaged the quality and decreased the efficiency of several government services. Rather than fend of one crisis after another, they should model, predict and plan for the consequences of their policies, preferably by evaluating the impact of policy changes in parts of the country prior to nation wide adoption. For example: The problems caused by the current rate of immigration could have been predicted over the last two decades, when the policies and agreements which would inevitably lead to these problems, were put in place. Similarly the timing of the current wave of immigrants was known two years ago, yet no significant preparations were put in place. Fortunately, this is a minor problem which if correctly handled can be turned into a fair investment or at worst a annoying loss. Unfortunately I see no tendency towards accounting for any of the other predictable problems which will occur over the next decades. Deflation, the chain of housing bubbles, reduced healthcare and safety standards due to various trade agreements and privatization, growing corruption in the public bid system, weakened unions, weakened consumer rights, massive job losses to automation, the risk for the development of a immobile low education high crime lower class, loss of militarily important local industries.

qualitycontributor,"Modified from an [earlier answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2b4a2l/alexander_ii_was_he_really_a_tsar_liberator/)

The effects of the Great Reforms (for brevity's sake, hereafter referred to as GR) were wide ranging and long lasting, but as a whole they do not support the notion that Alexander II was a progressive autocrat. Many of the GR would erode the strength of the Romanov system and contribute to the fragmentation of society that led to both the Revolutions of 1905 and 17.

The chief act associated with Alexander II was his abolition of serfdom in 1861. This had been a third rail within Russian politics for over fifty years. There was a growing consensus within Russian ruling circles that serfdom was an archaic anomaly that was out of place in the contemporary world. For Russia to be European, this logic held, serfdom would need to be abolished. The problem was one of how to get rid of serfdom without alienating the large rentier class of land owners, many of whom the state relied on as servitors within the large Russian hinterland. The GR decided upon an expedient solution of legal emancipation, but hobbled it with a confusing patchwork of redistribution and repayment of the landowners for the land. The GR emancipation created only small changes  land ownership for the serf-turned peasant. Few serfs could afford to make the payment for the land outright and the Russian state lacked the resources implement emancipation in a consistent manner. The peasant commune, the *mir* or *obshchina*, negotiated with the landlords and ended up owning land and parceled it out collectively.   

Coupled with emancipation was a series of localist reforms that granted a degree of autonomy and self-governance. In the Russian countryside, the *zemstvo* (pl. *zemstva*) had a very limited franchise but went a long way towards establishing something that resembled a civil society within the Russian countryside. A *zemstvo* was responsible for local issues and the development and maintenance of the local infrastructure. It also gave peasantry a degree of equal footing towards the nobility (limited, but much higher than prior to the GR).  The *zemstva* were largely limited to the core Russian territories; they were not within the Western Provinces nor in Siberia or Central Asia. Extention of the *Zemstava* to these areas would become to later Russian politicians as a contentious an issue as that of serfdom a generation before. 

The contentiousness of the Western *Zemstava* issue in the early twentieth century underscores an important aspect of the GR, that the chief beneficiaries of reform were frequently Great Russians, and the imperial state could be quite indifferent to the needs of its various subject populations. In the case of Poland, the attitude of the Romanovs was quite hostile and Alexander II's reign saw some of the greatest restrictions on Polish civil liberties in the aftermath of the failed 1863 rebellion. The era of the GR also witnessed the codification and cementing of a mentality of imperial officials that both its Ukrainian and Belorussian populations were in fact ""lost"" Russians that had been separated from the Great Russian cultural sphere through both an accident of history and Latin Polish perfidy. The state accordingly began to clamp down on the cultural activities of these peoples in order to hasten their Russification under the auspices of the Romanovs. For example., the Valuev Circular of 1863 imposed censorship and limits on Ukrainian language and printing, with the justification that Catholic Poles were using the language issue to drive a wedge between the tsar and his ""Russian""
subjects. By the same token, tsarist officials also closed down Catholic and Uniate churches n the Western Provinces and  reopening them as Russian Orthodox ones. The unification of Germany also fostered suspicions on the empire's Baltic German population, even though they had been as a corporate group one of the most loyal servitors of the Romanovs. And of course, antisemitism and restrictions against Jews remained in force during the GR. Jews were still not allowed to reside outside the Pale of Settlement unless they had an occupation and even converted Jews found that the glass ceiling in imperial society was very real. Unlike their Habsburg neighbors, the Jews of imperial Russia never really developed *Kaisertreu* sentiments that looked upon the emperor as a protector and benefactor. Although it has since become clear that the tsarist state did not sanction the various pogroms that occurred after Alexander II's assassination, there still was a widespread rumor that the state engineered this mob action. That such rumors gained widespread currency among contemporaneous Jewish communities demonstrates how little Jews figured into the state's policies of reform.
       
Within Russian cities and towns, Alexander II's reforms gave a degree of autonomy, but the GR laid the foundations for larger social conflicts. Although the GR allowed for elected city council (*Duma*) which appointed the executive council and the mayor. The franchise was incredibly restricted and based on land ownership and a series of nebulous other restrictions. This made the political governance of the Russian cities very tense as they evolved into metropolises. For example, Moscow had an odd situation as the new money industrialists often could not vote (they rented often palatial apartments) and the owners of decrepit hovels could. 

The most successful of the GR that reflects the notion of Alexander II as a progressive force were the judiciary reforms. The 1864 judiciary reform set up an independent judiciary, a jury system and Russian bar system that allowed for the professionalization of law. The first generation of Russia's nascent political party's leadership came from the Russian legal system. The courts themselves relatively open and were among the freest spaces in imperial society. By the same token, the GR expanded education and encouraged a degree of new thinking in Russia's higher education system. But like other aspects of the GR, the benefits of this new openness were not evenly distributed in Russian society. Advanced education became out of reach for the overwhelming majority of the population.  
One of the contradictions of the GR is that they exemplified the state's desire for Russia to modernize but also arrest the social changes that modernity unleashes. This was partly a function of how the Romanovs saw themselves within the state framework. Throughout the GR, one of the sacrosanct elements was the importance of autocracy; neither Alexander II nor his successors would tolerate any reform that ate away at the political strength of the tsar. Alexander II likened his role as a mediator between the various social groupings. This further fragmented political and social society at the expense of the institution of the tsar. The tsar simply could not be all things to such a heterogeneous polity as the Russian Empire. The historian Alfred Rieber describes late Russian society as a ""sedimentary society,"" in which various social identities coexisted and overlapped with one another. The democratization elements of the GR was one layer of these sediments, but this ultimately prevented any widespread social cohesiveness from evolving under the tsarist state.   

Why then does Alexander II have such a reputation as ""Tsar Liberator""? His assassination certainly added a counterfactual gloss to him, like JFK and Lincoln. Partly this is also a function of the fact that he came between two very conservative tsars. His father, Nicholas I, was a somewhat eccentric tsar who embraced Metternich's system of reaction with a verve and energy that surprised many. Like his Prussian counterpart Frederick William IV, Nicholas I believed he possessed a mystical connection with the land and its people. Alexander III was unlike his father and embraced Bismarckian archconservative nationalism and sought to transform the monarchy into a bastion for the right.  Finally, it should also be remembered that the very idea of reform was daunting for any tsar to undertake. Alexander II was able to use the defeat of the Crimean War to transform the Russian state in a series of massive leaps in a different direction. Alexander II possessed a degree of political realism that his son and grandson both lacked. Given how badly Nicholas II reacted to crises in the twentieth century, some appreciation of Alexander II is warranted even if he does not live up to his popular memory.

,"**a. Why did you choose to teach?**

A mixture of the ideological, practical and panicked. I have always wanted a job where I felt I made a direct impact and that I found politically acceptable. I like kids and find them mega fun. I needed a steady wage and stability. I didn't know what else I wanted.

**b. What are some of the most rewarding aspects of teaching**

Great relationships with kids. Crafting the perfect lesson and watching it unfold perfectly. Making breakthroughs with difficult kids.

**c. What are some of the most difficult parts of teaching?**

Behaviour management. I'm a 1st year teacher in one of the most impoverished areas of Europe. Many days I feel totally emotionally exhausted, occasionally I feel completely degraded.

**d. Are you more or less confident...**

I literally have no idea. I felt better as a student teacher than I do now as a for-realzies teacher. The waters get muddier when you're alone and it's just you and the kids. For a job that's literally 100% social interaction, it can be really fucking lonely.

**e. How effective...**

It kinda worked in that sense, but the results are... unfortunate, one of many cases why modern Integrated Pest Management techniques place such stringent guidelines on the importation of invasive species in the control method. Afracanized bees' behavior seems to be a collection of highly dominant genes and nurture, so that any time that a European-type queen mates with an Africanized drone or even a half Afracanized drone, the hive exhibits most or all of the negative traits including wide guard perimeters, low stress tolerance (leading to rapid and ready relocation, spreading the invasive species further), and heightened aggression.

          to the 'Norway option'. We have not and will 
          not. After we Vote Leave, Britain will negotiate

        ""Britain is the 5th largest economy in the World. 
         We are six times larger than Norway. Of course 
         we can negotiate our own UK EU trade agreement.

&gt; McCloskey diz que o Grande Enriquecimento foi possível por meio de uma revolução, em câmera lenta, nas convicções éticas sobre virtudes e vícios na Europa moderna. Em especial, por um nível muito mais elevado de tolerância que levou os europeus a enxergar com mais simpatia os inovadores, os produtores e os comerciantes.

Agora até a história econômica entrou numas de politicamente correto? Capitalismo criando sistemas financeiros com letras de câmbio e mercado de ações são irrelevantes? Revolução industrial não fez diferença? Leis estáveis protegendo livre iniciativa não foram nada?

Fatos: capitalismo financeiro e industrial foi forjado a ferro e fogo. Os primeiros bancos (vide Banca di Medici) foram criados para financiar as guerras de pilhagem das cidades italianas e o comércio dos italianos com os mouros. O primeiro mercado de ações foi criado para financiar a Companhia Holandesa das Índias Ocidentais, a maior multinacional do século 17 e um dos empreendimentos mais genocidas da história. A Revolução Industrial foi suja, feia e trágica. Mas foram esses fatos feios que geraram aumentos de produtividade. E foi esse aumento da produtividade que trouxe progressos morais, não o contrário.

Os ""inovadores"" não receberam ""simpatia"" por causa de um aumento de tolerância. Eles conquistaram essa simpatia e tolerância com corrupção, truculência, revoluções, guerras e muito maquiavelismo.

,"&gt; However, you miss the concept here. I am talking about worldly and supernatural knowledge, not technology. How the world is organized, not the daily operations of man kind.

It's still wrong. Medieval natural philosophy made several discoveries of the natural world that couldn't be found in either the Bible or in any texts of antiquity. Jean Buridan's theory of inertia is one pertinent example. 

&gt; Yes. Any discovery of a fully unknown landmass.

Why would that be necessary? 

&gt; This argument is backwards. The Church said words to the effect of ""This is ALL there is"".

Source needed. 

&gt; If you look at the T-O maps that list only three continents. This is pretty much solid examples saying, ""This is all there is, this is God's creation.""

No, it isn't. T-O maps weren't meant to be intepreted literally in the late 15th century. T-O maps were allegorical. 

One example of this: The T-O maps are two-dimensional with Jerusalem in the centre. The Church knew that earth is a sphere, but the T-O map cannot explain a spherical world. 

&gt; As I said before, If the Church was wrong about how God made the world, perhaps the Church is wrong about how to save our souls. Luther and Calvin both use the Bible to point out that the Church is in violation of what they claim God wants. Now that the Church's authority is broken (along with Political considerations in the Holy Roman Empire), people are willing to give Luther more support than they had for previous reformers.

Then it surely cannot be difficult for you to find *any* influential Protestant mentioning the discovery of the Americas as a problem for Catholic doctrine. The Church was active in the colonialisation of the Americas from the beginning - it had no problems incorporating it into their world view. 

&gt; The colonization and Conquest of the Americas gave the Spanish the silver needed to open up ports in the Philippines. It pushed Dutch, English, and French merchants into the East to compete for the trade.

The trade was valuable *regardless* of the existence of the Americas. 

&gt; The conquest of the Americas required better shipping and forced the great European powers into more intense competition and provided them more resources that aided them in their conquest of the East.

It would have happened either way. 

&gt; Consider the English. They conquered the Eastern bit of North America against Native Americans who only had any success when the colonists were few in numbers. The English grew strong from the economic resources gained through these Colonies that allowed them to rival and then surpass, those countries in asia. How would they have gotten the resources to do that without the Americas to provide it?

Technological superiority requires no resource advantage. 

&gt; Without the Americas, I can't fathom a way for europe to catch up to east or west asia, let alone Sub Saharan Africa.

Europe was, scientifically speaking, ahead of East Asia by the 17th century. This happened long before the United Kingdom could compete with the resources of China. 

&gt; The specifics, maybe, but how do you get away from the militarization of Africa? Any group that was not militant was captured and sold.

Africa was undoubtedly changed by Transatlantic slavery, but make no mistake, the continent either would have continued the development of nation states *or* they would have been colonised by the European nation states. Colonialism wasn't contingent on the Americas. 

I think I might have been unclear. I didn't object to the claim that Africa was affected, or even institutionally or economically altered by the demand for slaves.

,"You're misconstruing what Harper did in government.  Everyone uses this whole ""Harper eggs and basket"" metaphor but really don't get where the money was coming from.

The biggest chunk of oilsands investment came from the Liberal Party.  So people correctly identify that the Liberals did in fact lead Canada's boom and lead our economy.  The process began with Mulroney in the 80s, so one might say it was a bipartisan project to direct Canada's efforts to environmental ruin and economic success.

For decades Canada has been directly subsidizing oil.  But that ended when Harper came into government.  It ended because foreign investment in Canadian oil had made a major swing and subsidizing the industry was now considered a waste of tax payer dollars.

The money during the Harper years wasn't coming from the Canadian government but instead from the US, China, Japan and South Korea.  Oil became such a massive part of our economy specifically because Canada was seeing massive external investment coming to it.  Fraser Institute did a report a few years ago showing that in fact Alberta sees the least amount of investment but the best dollar per investment whereas Newfoundland was seeing the most investment but the least dollar per investment.

What Harper did do was create an oil and gas tax credit when the industry went bust.  Yes, the first time Harper subsidized the oil and gas industry was when it was failing.  It's a billion dollar tax credit.  But that's no different from how he responded to the farmers during this years drought.

The only real 'subsidy' that a major industry received was the automotive bailout of 2008 which cost Canadian tax payers $3.5B and $1.2B a year in tax credits.

If anything Harper has been trying to spruce up other Canadian industries by signing a record number of free trade deals.  The big fish is obviously the TPP but they were also trying to court Europe.

Canada's biggest challenge is that most of the products we produce are seen as unethical.  We build polluting cars.  We produce 'dirty' oil.  We produce plastics.  We produce pipeline.  We produce steel.  Hell, even our sealskin industry is under attack.

In any case, my point is, even when if dual citizenship is allowed, conservatives should be more likely to keep Turkish citizenship as a means of preserving ties with Turkey. It's just my guess though, I haven't seen any surveys about it. (Also, as far as I know, German citizens of Turkish origin tend to vote for left parties in Germany, which seems to support my hypothesis that leftists are more likely to get German citizenship; but it may also be that they are just hypocritical conservatives who vote left only because of self-interest, I don't know).",europe,0,3,cfsenel,3,False,1446499864,t1_cwm0df8,t5_2qh4j,cwm2lki,t3_3r7h7k,Turkey,1449556477,,0,
,"This is a good answer. At the time, the art movement was very much inspired by the Classical Greek and Roman artifacts - neo classicism was at it's height. Most of Europe would have been very familiar with the Ptolomeys Egypt and have heard about it in tht Bible as well as in Alexander the Greats exploits. Couple that with the fact nobody had been there before Napoleon and the vast amount of cultural and archeological artifacts they uncovered had a massive effect on the fashions and trends for Europe. After Egypt, the Guard adopted a formation of Mameluke inspired light horse regiment, the palace furniture was now Egyptian inspired (in addition to bring covered in bees) and women's fashion for the exotic Arabian dress was at an all time high. This was also one of the first times the Mameluke sword came to represent a generals sword, although his tradition did not stick with the French army as much as it did the British and the US Marines thereafter.

,"&gt; Because of the way that Capitalism has managed to become a global phenomenon ... Communism in virtue must also be global

So, just to clarify, you're saying that it's unlikely that communism would be successful unless it was a global revolution?

&gt; faster technological advancements leading to the obsoletion of previous modes of production, which increases the contradictions within them, leading to large scale Capitalist revolutions

I agree that technological advancements make previous modes of production obsolete (though this happens in non-communist systems as well). However, I'm not clear on the ""which increases the contradictions within them"" part. What contradictions within what?

&gt; Using the example you provided of Europe, the Communists would still have to participate in international trade and competition with Capitalist nations in order to gain access to specific materials.

How would that work? Who is authorized to make such an exchange?

&gt; So Idealism ... 

Ok, fair enough. But just to clarify, you're not claiming this is in any way limited to communism or Marxist thought, right?

&gt; For example, an idealist analysis of Nazi Germany may say that it was evil, whereas a materialist one would explain the physical circumstances that pushed them to their destination

Can't both be right? Can't it be evil, but also have a perfectly rational explanation for how sane people could find themselves in that position? Isn't that what most explanations of it represent? Isn't that basically what most anti-war advocates do when looking at middle-eastern terrorism? That is, the acts are evil and horrible, but they result from a perception of massive injustice, intervention, and oppression.

&gt; The reason Marx’s understanding of Capitalism is empirically correct is because it has been cleared free from the mists of ideology. 

Ok, but that still seems to basically be an assertion that his analysis is correct because he was objective and unbiased (whether because he didn't want to change it or just because Marx was all intellectually Zen and able to avoid all personal biases).

&gt; Marx looks at how Capitalism works and functions free from ideological distortions because in order to overthrow it, we must understand exactly how it operates free from preconceived positive or negative notions.

But yet isn't he placing his own biases on that evaluation? Doesn't a large part of the basis for his analysis form from his view that the exclusionary aspect of private property to be wrong/immoral/evil and then attempted to rationalize it by asserting his perception of value (labor theory of value)? And isn't it the same basic thing with his view of money? (I'll try to avoid getting into a debate on labor theory of value itself.)

It's coming across very close to a religious assertion that ""My belief is right because our prophet saw through the indoctrination and lies of the world and through to the light of truth!"" I apologize as I'm not trying to be dismissive or combative, but I'm just having a hard time with this idea that Marx's analysis of capitalism is correct because he, unlike basically every other human to have walked the earth, has no preconceived notions, no biases, no personal values that tint their perception and thus the analysis and evaluation of large scale, complex systems. 

&gt; Thanks for the correction, I still have yet to read Adam Smith (have Wealth of Nations on my reading list) and don’t have a strong grasp of Marxian economics, so I won’t argue against anything you wrote.

No problem. Economics and socio-political philosophy are about big and complicated systems. And all have numerous competing views, theories and beliefs. It took a long time for me to understand most of the views of capitalist advocates, of which there are again numerous different views and perceptions of ""the right"". I've dipped my toe into the communist waters from time to time in order to try to understand what its advocates are really saying, as opposed to the caricatures and straw men that its opponents create. And I have to say that, while I certainly don't agree with them, it is *usually* (there are always exceptions) a good exercise.

I personally enjoy when people challenge capitalism and free markets as well. It forces me to express myself and to defend my views. It ensures that I have a good grasp of the moral, philosophical and historical underpinnings of my views and a good discussion usually exposes to me the weaknesses I may not have been aware of previously.

,"&gt; First, the only way to keep federal debt manageable is through monetary inflation.

The best way to keep federal debt manageable is to grow GDP faster than we grow federal spending (or shrink it faster than we shrink GDP, if you prefer).  This will increase revenues and cover the balance over time.  This is why politicians have a continuous strong incentive to see strong year-to-year economic growth.

&gt; The problem here is, monetary inflation affects the poor of us the worst.

Inflation benefits debtors to the detriment of lenders.  By and large, poor people are debtors not lenders, so inflation benefits the poor.  It's worth noting that inflation has been at historic lows recently.  And as you have noted above, real wages and employment are *also* underperforming.  This is not a coincidence.

Poor people are harmed when rich people believe they can get a better ROI by stuffing money in mattresses than by paying laborers to produce and utilize business capital.  Inflation discourages people from hording currency, which is good for the economy as a whole and for the unemployed and the underpaid specifically.

&gt; When stock prices go up as there are no other alternative places for people to put their money, it is the rich that win. Cutting spending would help set us up to raise the interest rate.

Stock prices and bond prices tend to have an inverse relationship.  So you can just as easily conclude ""When bond prices go up, the rich win"".  And bond prices go up when interest rates go up.  But the dirty truth is that the rich win either way.  If you're a clever investor, you can profit in any economy.

Past that, cutting spending *would not* help set up higher interest rates.  The Fed sets rates based on unemployment and inflation.  Cutting spending would reduce unemployment and lower wages which would cut the inflation rate.  The Fed would, in turn, attempt another round of QE to stimulate the economy.  It would not increase interest rates, as this would further cut into inflation and decrease employment.

&gt; By contrast, I believe things that help our economy and cause it to grow are education spending and infrastructure spending (to be clear, I consider roads, utilities, other transit, and even hospitals, restaurants, etc, to all be considered infrastructure). I said earlier, at a minimum, I would reallocate away from military spending. I personally believe we can bring troops home, put them to work building our infrastructure, and cut spending all a the same time.

I'd love to see European-style spending priorities, where we focus our money on infrastructure and education rather than defense.

But that's a separate issue from spending as it pertains to inflation, unemployment, and median take-home pay.  A shift from defense spending to education and infrastructure would necessarily cut into median income, simply because we don't pay our teachers and our construction workers like we pay our Boeing and Raytheon engineers.

If you want to increase median income, you need to pay the median employee more money.  Simple as that.  If you want to decrease unemployment, you need to hire more people.  The unemployment rate doesn't care whether you're employing people as civil engineers or aeronautic techs.  The median income rate doesn't care whether the employee is teaching physics or building bombs.

I absolutely agree that we should be investing in public works at the expense of our national ~~offense~~ defense.

,"found this recent answer on their forums:
https://forums.daybreakgames.com/landmark/index.php?threads/omg-where-is-everybody.55771/

There are no more than roughly 100 people playing at any given point in time.

There are 4 servers. If you do a /who at various times of day and night (to account for people playing in Europe) and do this on each server (a /who tells you all who is playing on that server, not biome, the entire server) and you tally the numbers its no more than about 100 max and an average would be closer to about 60% or 60 people playing at any point in time.

This is the most 'dead' game I have ever seen in 'early access'.

There is a simple reason for this. Although the building in this game is phenomenal compared to any other building game out there, there is also no game loop or anything to do BUT build. Daybreak has taken the stance of focusing more on landmark being used for the workshop then they have about developing landmark as its own game which is obvious and apparent by their actions or lack of actions since Soe was sold to Columbus nova and they became Daybreak.

My suggestion is if you are having fun, keep playing. I however would not suggest to spend money on a game that does not have the playerbase to sustain any form of income for the company. At some point the bean counters will come in and cancel the project if it costs more than they make off of it.

I would venture to say the only reason landmark is even still around is because it defers a lot of the cost off of EQN. Art has to be made in game and Daybreak uses the workshop to procure free art assets for EQN, which essentially 'pays' for landmark. Smed said it himself at a round table discussion with the devs when SOE was bought out. Most of the devs except dave georgeson did not feel landmark was a success and smed insisted it was because of the cost savings of developing EQN.

At the end of the day, as long as the focus for landmark is to get people to make free assets for Daybreak and not focusing on making a fun game, you will never see a large population. Most people are simply not that easily duped.


EDIT: I just did a count at 3:35am central time. Which is 4:35am Eastern and 1:35am pacific and 9:35am in England.

Courage - 4 people playing
Liberation - 10 people playing
Serentity - 8 people playing
Satisfaction (EU) - 13 people playing. 

So you have a grand total of 35 people playing landmark right now out of 7.3 billion people on the planet (ya ya, I know to be fair some of those are babies and cant play on computers).

In the North pasta competes with other two foods as a first course, polenta and rice ( Italy is actually the first producer of rice in Europe and we grow only local varieties). 

Secondly, we became a unified country only 150 years ago, so most of Italians have also a regional identity and that comes with differences in culture, mindset, food, language ( or dialect), etc. Each of the 21 regions of Italy has its own dialect, and in the North and South of Italy there are several linguistic minorities speaking (from North to South) French, Provencal, German, Slovene, Furlan, Ladino, Catalan, Albanian, Greek and Croatian.

Lando knew staying was a death sentence if Han wasn't successful.

nietzsche,"At this stage in our debates, we should make a poll on race realism / HBD; the questions could be: 

&gt;""Is race a useful term and heuristic?""

* No, race does not biologically exist and/or is merely a divisive political tool.

* No, evaluate the metric you actually care about (intelligence, crime, political views, etc.).

* At least somewhat, as social capital makes race matter even with meritorious naturalization.

* Yes, race is the most predictive criterion and social capital matters so much it should ultimately trump meritocracy, i.e. we should have a racialist nation and only a meritocracy from there.

&gt;""Are many of the claims by race realists and HBDers accurate?""

* No, studies have not been adequate or even point the other way.

* Yes, but largely academic, as meritocracy should still be the rule of the day, irrespective of ""social capital,"" i.e. the individual shall always be sovereign and his rights not infringed for the sake of social externality arguments.

* Yes, and with political consequences, due to social capital; meritocracy should not be the final principle, but perpetuation of a race.

* Yes, but meritocracy can and should still be the rule of the day, as a meritocracy would still result in very high levels of social capital (i.e. still be mostly European).

Any other questions (or worthy amendments to the above two) would be welcome.

&gt; Adjágas is Sara Marielle Gaup and Lawra Somby- yoikers of Sami origin from in Sapmi (Lapland) in Norway's far north. Both are joined by a revolving group of backing musicians. Yoiking is a integral part of the Saami of Northern Europe's history, tradition and culture.

&gt; Sara Marielle Gaup, 21, hails from Guovdageaidnu/Kautokeino and began singing at a very early age, and it was through continued musical education at SMG she developed her unique sense of performance and perfected her singing voice. Her musical heritage has been passed down to her from her parents and generations before that. Lawra Somby, 24, was taught the great gift of yoiking from his father, Ande Somby. Lawra started performing on a variety of stages in 1997, and he has performed his music both solo as well as with his father Ande, making him a an experienced singer with a strong stage presence. Yoik is not about making stories about people, animals, situations or landscapes. Yoik is the young woman, the eagle, the grass field by the river they are recreations of a moment, a sense, a memory how the wings of a bird slowly touches your chin, the smell of a fireplace and and how it evokes memories. The yoik is about bringing memories into the light of day, making them available and inviting new people into this special world.

We see the same old players over and over again because the organizations are not independent.

,"&gt;As I pointed out with the 3 field system it is a totally different approach, so is the Heavy plow. The Water wheel too (unless you can show me the Greek usage of it).

&gt;The idea of improving what they had, such as the 2 field system, vs replacing it with a very new idea, a 3 field system is my point.
The idea of replacing human labor with water wheels is my point.
The idea of radically changing the nature of the plow vs making the old plow more efficient is my point.

The heavy plough is just a heavier, wheeled variant of what was used in the Roman era. Just from reading the wiki, it's written, as per *The Oxford Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World*, that the structure had already existed in the Roman world in the late Empire. Clearly it wasn't such a great feat of ingenuity from later kingdoms, just the logical adaptation to the environment.

I don't know enough about agriculture to argue over the 3 field system, but spreading crops over multiple fields, namely 3 instead of 2, doesn't quite sound such a revolutionary idea, just another adaptation to different conditions when the technology allowed it and better understanding of agriculture.

&gt;Thank you for the map, but to my knowledge, none of those areas were uninhabited. Germans, Gauls, Dacians, Sythians, Britons, all lived in those areas.

None of these areas had any kind of significant urban development. These areas were built around the colonia for the most part. I'm not sure how directing masses of populations (I believe at first it was mostly garrisons moved into conquered territory, which then developed into webs of cities) isn't colonizing an area. It actually isn't much different than what the Phoenicians or Greeks did, just on a massive scale which would create the centers of population for Europe in the centuries to come.

&gt;But for a long time Roman law was supplanted by local law, often Germanic in influence and Church canon law. It was the reexamination of old Roman laws during the Renaissance that brought their ideas to light.

&gt;Romans did improve on the laws too. I would even credit them with real innovation there, but innovations that were set aside for hundreds of years. Unlike the Greeks or older empires, they allowed for regional variations in the law.

How does that differ from any significant development? Today, legal structures around the world are based on law that was instituted by the Romans. It's a pretty damn significant development. Doesn't that actually fly in the face of decline when nations would later go back to Roman law and implement it in their countries, adapting it to their conditions, considering it the best possible legal tradition? Clearly the Romans had many developments which would be well adapted for large states, such that later, more modern nations which had outgrown regionalism would go back to Roman ideas.

Dito isso, falemos de Brasil. 8 horas de trabalho por dia + faculdade integral + deslocamento só se tu tiver um trampo noturno e olhe lá ainda são poucos os que aguentam. Dito isso, não sei qual curso tu pretende fazer mas vou pressupor que é um período e em faculdade pública ( particular + despesas com esse salário esquece ).

O segredo da sua sobrevivência vai ser viver com outras pessoas. Eu já li no tópico aqui que você não quer fazer isso, se for o caso você vai ter que ter uma rotina meio espartana, mas vamos lá:

a) Comida- Para economizar ao máximo, é comida levada de casa que você vai ter que cozinhar, na refeição em que você estiver em horário de serviço e restaurante universitário no período que você estiver em casa. Se você conseguir fazer isso seu custo vai ser uns 400-600 reais por mês, considerando que você vai comprar outras coisas como leite, suco e etc.... se não comprar nada disso pode ficar até bem mais barato mas é bem difícil.

b) Período: 90% dos trabalhos, são feitos no horário da manha e da tarde. Assim sendo, cursar faculdade no período noturno facilitaria sua vida, por ter mais opções de trabalho. Leva algo para comer no almoço e r.u a noite.

c) Você tem que ter uma grana para: Luz + internet ( morando sozinho dá uns 100 reais, até menos se você economizar e muito mais se abusar de chuveiro e pc ligado 24 horas por dia), despesas com transporte ( onibus para seu trabalho, onibus para a faculdade, onibus para voltar ou manutenção do seu carro + gasolina+ tributos), aluguel ( sozinho ou dividido, o preço depende de onde você mora, você vai ter que pesquisar ) e condomínio ( caso você more em área de condomínio, tipo kit net) que deve sair uns 200 reais. Telefone celular também é algo considerando essencial por muitos, 20-100 reais dependendo do seu consumo ( você não vai ter margem para gastar mais que isso de jeito nenhum ).

d) Fundo de emergência: Você nunca sabe quando vai ser demitido, ou passar mal. Não estou nem falando de pagar consulta privada ou plano de saúde, o que seria o recomendável, mas de simplesmente ter grana para chamar um taxi e te levar em um hospital depois de uma infecção alimentar. É necessário ter um pé de meia para caso coisas ruins aconteçam.

e) Lazer: Para você sobreviver aos anos de seu curso e rotina cansativa de trabalho + faculdade, você provavelmente vai ter gastos com lazer. Isso pode ser desde uma quantidade gigantesca até algo mínimo e vai de você ver o quanto gasta com isso geralmente.

f) Impostos: Se você ganhar mais do que 26.816,55,/ ano você vai ter que pagar IR. Se você tiver carro, vai ter que pagar IPVA ( suponho que conte como manutenção do carro), etc, etc,etc. Como não conheço sua situação, não sei quais e se você vai ter que pagar ( no mínimo, você vai ter que considerar a colaboração da previdência ).

Conclusão: É difícil viver sozinho até depois de formado para a maioria das profissões. Vivi sozinho dos 17-21 fazendo a faculdade, voltei a morar com meus pais e só saí de 23 para 24 quando tinha juntado 180k para usar como entrada para um apartamento perto de onde trabalho. Pelos cálculos de necessidades BÁSICAS que te apresentei, espero que você reconsidere a questão de não dividir aluguel se não, você certamente vai sofrer MUITO.

,"Here's more for you!!!

From Wikipedia (actual quotes from Arab leaders):
&gt;Khalid al-`Azm who was prime minister of Syria from 17 December 1948 to 30 March 1949, listed in his memoirs a number of reasons for the Arab defeat in an attack on the Arab leaders including his own predecessor Jamil Mardam Bey:

&gt;Fifth: the Arab governments' invitation to the people of Palestine to flee from it and seek refuge in adjacent Arab countries, after terror had spread among their ranks in the wake of the Deir Yassin event. This mass flight has benefited the Jews and the situation stabilized in their favor without effort.... Since 1948 we have been demanding the return of the refugees to their homeland, while it is we who constrained them to leave it. Between the invitation extended to the refugees and the request to the United Nations to decide upon their return, there elapsed only a few months.[16]
After the war, a few Arab leaders tried to present the Palestinian exodus as a victory by claiming to have planned it. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri as-Said was later quoted as saying: ""We will smash the country with our guns and obliterate every place the Jews shelter in. The Arabs should conduct their wives and children to safe areas until the fighting has died down.""[17]

&gt;Jamal Husseini, Palestinian representative to the United Nations, wrote to the Syrian UN representative, at the end of August 1948,

&gt;“	""The withdrawals were carried out pursuant to an order emanating from Amman. The withdrawal from Nazareth was ordered by Amman; the withdrawal from Safad was ordered by Amman; the withdrawal orders from Lydda and Rale are well known to you. During none of these withdrawals did fighting take place. The regular armies did not enable the inhabitants of the country to defend themselves, but merely facilitated their escape from Palestine.
All the orders emanated from one place...[18][19]

&gt;”
&gt;According to Yitschak Ben Gad, Mahmoud Abbas, then member of PLO Executive Committee, wrote an article ""Madha `Alamna wa-Madha Yajib An Na`mal"" [What We Have Learned and What We Should Do] and published it in ""Falastineth-Thawra"" [Revolutionary Palestine], the official journal of the PLO, Beirut, in March 26, 1976:

&gt;""The Arab armies entered Palestine to protect the Palestinians from the Zionist tyranny but, instead, they abandoned them, forced them to emigrate and to leave their homeland, and threw them into prisons similar to the ghettos in which the Jews used to live in Eastern Europe, as if we were condemned to change places with them: they moved out of their ghettos and we occupied similar ones. The Arab States succeeded in scattering the Palestinian people and in destroying their unity.""[20][unreliable source?][21]

&gt; Monsignor Lucio Angel Vallegjo Balda, a priest, and Francesca Chaouqui, an independent PR consultant, were both members of a 2013 commission established by Pope Francis to improve Vatican finances and reduce corruption.

&gt; The two books, &amp;quot;Avarice&amp;quot; by Emiliano Fittipaldi and &amp;quot;Merchants in the Temple&amp;quot; by Gianluigi Nuzzi, are both being released Thursday, and with the arrests the Vatican is indicating that any new leaks within them can likely be traced to Balda and Chaouqui.

&gt; &amp;quot;We must absolutely avoid the mistake of thinking that this is a way to help the mission of the Pope.&amp;quot; The Vatican characterized the document leaks not only as unlawful, but as a &amp;quot;Serious betrayal&amp;quot; of Pope Francis.

,"Buying used outside of Europe is difficult.  It's hard enough to find players, but finding players with extra boules that they're willing to part with that match your specifications is almost impossible.

I'll recommend [Petanque America](http://www.petanqueamerica.com/combal.html) which you might already be familiar with since you mentioned La Franc boules.  If I recall, the cost of shipping is a flat rate - you pay about $30 for a box, and whatever you can fit in there you can ship.  The box holds about three sets of boules.  Your best bet might be to find two other new players who want to invest in the game with you, and buy new sets as well.  If that's the case, you're only paying $10 shipping each, which is pretty good considering the weight.",Petanque,0,2,8LimbScientist,2,False,1446511737,t3_3qrlpr,t5_2u9wn,cwmaf0q,t3_3qrlpr,,1449560224,,0,

ADYG,"Well, culturally and historically North Caucasus is also Europe. But of course, places like Iceland, Greek Islands, Cyprus, ~~British isles~~, etc should also be considered as Europe, even geographically they're not.

It's just weird for me if somebody does not consider Northern Caucasus as Europe, especially while native Caucasians are in Europe more than many current European peoples, and their ethnic culture is European, their ethnicity is European and they had met with Greek culture before other nations if the things are about the current common European culture, etc. I think they just don't know anything about the region other than the rise of radical Islam in the last one decade, in some parts of North Caucasus, which had brought to the region by foreign fighters and had risen as a response to suppression - and it's understandable that even if they are tiny minority, it does not seem like that if you only go with some headlines from some tabloids. It's still illogical for me to think this though. Shared values concept is another thing; I'm not sure, not just if Eastern Europeans or Balkan countries are sharing values that some people are thinking that is the defining thing to be European or not, but also if their own countrymen are even sharing these values as  whole, and how many Europeans were sharing these very values just half a century or maybe 1-2 centuries ago - I can understand the culture but some values (which I'm not against by the way, but that's not the issue) that have only became more common recently, eh, no.",europe,0,7,haveyougoogle,7,1446561227,1446511891,t1_cwm8x8g,t5_2qh4j,cwmaidq,t3_3r8kku,Circassian,1449560269,,0,
