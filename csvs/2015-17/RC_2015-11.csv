&gt;Hitler's concept of concentration camps as well as the practicality of genocide owed much, so he claimed, to his studies of English and United States history. He admired the camps for Boer prisoners in South Africa and for the Indians in the wild west; and often praised to his inner circle the efficiency of America's extermination—by starvation and uneven combat—of the red savages who could not be tamed by captivity.

How are the Native Americans treated to day in the United States ? I know that in Canada it was pretty bad, until very recently. 

Did Canada commit a ‘cultural genocide’?

&gt;Thousands of Europeans are Indians, and we have no examples of even one of these Aborigines having from choice become Europeans




Edit: Americans know terrifyingly little about their genocidal campaigns against the Native Americans. It's not at all a real focus of the study of history, and is almost always painted in a ""positive"" picture. Way until the Vietnam and Iraq wars.

Misticsan,6,6,1446338606,1446338149,,"Because it's a Western bias that started after the German historian Hieronymus Wolf published in 1557 his work Corpus Historiæ Byzantinæ, and it caught on.

The name the Byzantines had for their nation was Roman Empire, Empire of the Romans or Romania, depending on the situation. A quick look at Anna Komnena's *Alexiad* will give you hundreds of examples. However, in the West the term ""Roman"" started being associated to the idea of the Carolingian Empire of Charlemagne (crowned in 800 by the Pope, taking the title ""most serene Augustus crowned by God, the great, peaceful emperor ruling the Roman empire""). The idea was later revived by Otto the Great, the founder of the Holy Roman Empire as we know it. The Popes even made a forgery, the Donation of Constantine, to support the Pope's authority in this matter.

Let it be said that before Charlemagne's coronation the relationship between the Pope and the Byzantines wasn't great, and the Pope saw the Carolingians as safer and more reliable protectors. 

From that moment onward, in Western Europe the title ""Empire of the Romans"" was officially reserved for the German empire. As BoraFan has mentioned, the term ""Empire of the Greeks"" started being used for the Byzantines.

And no, that didn't sit well at all in Romania.

To give a first-hand example, Liutprand of Cremona was an ambassador from Emperor Otto to Constantinople and he had a discussion about the nature of being 'Roman' with the Byzantine Emperor himself. You can read more about his diplomatic mission in 968 [in this link](http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/source/liudprand1.asp), but here's the part about the Byzantines' reaction when they received a letter by the Pope (that was intended to be a gesture of goodwill) in which they were called Greeks instead of Romans:

&gt; But, to increase my calamities, on the day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary the holy mother of God (August 15), there came-an evil augury for me-envoys of the apostolic and universal pope John, through whom he asked Nicephorus, the emperor of the Greeks "" to close an alliance and firm friendship with his beloved and spiritual son Otto ""august emperor of the Romans."" Before the question as to why- this word, this manner of address, sinful and bold in the eyes of the Greeks, did not cost its bearer his life-why he was not annihilated before it was read, I, who, in other respects, have often shown myself enough of a preacher and with words enough at my command, seem dumb as a fish! The Greeks inveighed against the sea, cursed the waves, and wondered exceedingly how they had been able to transport such an iniquity end why the yawning deep had not swallowed up the ship. ""Was it not unpardonable,"" they said, ""to have called the universal emperor of the Romans, the august, great, only Nicephorus: ""of the Greeks""';-a barbarian, a pauper: of the Romans'? Oh sky! Oh earth! Oh sea! But what,"" they said, ""shall we do to those scoundrels, those criminals?"" They are paupers, and if we kill them we pollute our hands with vile blood; they are ragged, they are slaves, they are peasants; if we beat them we disgrace not them, but ourselves; for they are not worthy of the gilded Roman flail and of such punishments. Oh would that one were a bishop, another a margrave! For sewing them in sacks, after stinging blows with whips, after plucking out their beards or their hair, they would be thrown into the sea. But these,"" they said, "" may continue to live; and, until the holy emperor of the Romans, Nicephorus, learns of this atrocity, they may languish in narrow confinement.""

So, yes, being Romans was serious business for the Byzantines. 

If Western historians started using the name 'Byzantine' was probably due to custom (helped by the fact the Byzantine Empire didn't exist anymore to complain) and an increasingly bad reputation of the Byzantines among Western writers, who nevertheless admired classical Rome.

Ironically, their real name was more respected by their Muslim enemies. Their name for the Byzantines, *Rum*, comes precisely from the word ""Roman"". There is even a surah in the Quran called ""The Romans"" (Ar-Rum), in which it is declared that despite their initial defeats, the Romans would win the war against Persia (it's about the Byzantine-Sasanian War of 602-628). When the Turks invaded Anatolia, they founded the ""Sultanate of Rum"" and later, after conquering Constantinople, the Ottomans used, among many other titles, the name *Kayser-i Rum*.",AskHistorians,0,t3_3qzum4,,1447323045,0,,t3_3qzum4,t5_2ssp3,cwjz2ni,

foreheadteeth,31,31,1446380716,1446339602,,"I was born in 1974 in Canada and this story sounds familiar. I moved to Europe about 10 years ago. I can't say for sure but I suspect two things about contrasts in old foods between the continents:

1. Then and now, fresh European meats taste worse and are more expensive than American meats, on average. You can debate the reasons but it's a fact.

2. The culture of having tiny houses with [tiny fridges](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/photo/v1/1103375505/95L_Compressor_European_Style_Refrigerator_BC_95.jpg_220x220.jpg) and a market at the street corner means that Europeans do their groceries almost daily.

(I'm talking about the continent, not the UK.)

As a result of these two main differences, I think Europeans probably had (and still have) nicer ""alternative"" foods like [melon and Parma ham](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/106695/prosciutto-e-melone-italian-ham-and-melon/); this is a really good way of stretching the meat. The melon grows in nearby Spain for many months each year and you go buy it fresh every day or something. My mom in Canada would do weekly groceries, get green bananas that came from Morocco. When she shops in Europe she can't buy any of the bananas because she thinks they're all overripe (she's never seen ripe banana before).

However, I have almost never had a truly delicious steak in Europe, and people 50 years ago in the USA and Canada were having delicious steaks and lobster on a regular basis. My mom was horrified when we bought some meat in Switzerland for 100$ that would have cost 20$ in Canada. At that price, you'd probably be eating tripe too.

Lobster exists ""theoretically"" in Europe but I've never actually seen one. My PhD student just went to Canada and had lobster almost every day; he'd never had lobster before.

I think my grandparents's foods were quite good. They didn't have [fresh mozzarella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_QBeo4dnpg&amp;t=9m00s), but they had [barbecued T-bones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af-cukklUIw&amp;t=3m30s).

Edit: also, and maybe some people aren't going to like me saying this, but a lot of the modern ""fancy"" food in the USA isn't that good. I went to a French restaurant in NYC and ordered, in French from my French waiter, a [steak Rossini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournedos_Rossini) with [gratin dauphinois](http://ellena28.canalblog.com/archives/2011/09/06/21922550.html). Rossini means ""topped with foie gras""; gratin dauphinois is thinly sliced potatoes baked in cream and Gruyère cheese. They served me a good steak, then ruined it by topping it with some disgusting pseudo-paté (more fancy feast than foie gras); the side was half-raw garlic potatoes (no cream or cheese). They can get away with this on the ""fancy"" food because Americans don't know what they're supposed to get. They can't get away with this when they serve you a burger though.

Rivarossi has a Americanized S100 tank engine (an 0-6-0T), should that be of any interest to you (I believe Joeuf makes the European version). I can't recall how smooth it runs though.

Bachmann also has a lineup of 0-6-0T Porters in their DCC-On-Board line, for a slightly earlier prototype. Not quite as detailed as the older Spectrum 0-6-0Ts, but still quite nice looking IMO. Their 2-6-0 they introduced not too long ago is also a relatively compact loco, and is surprising affordable for a steam locomotive with sound. Bachmann's ubiquitous 2-8-0 is also still around and just as good as ever, although it's part of their standard line nowadays.

MTH has a 2-8-0 that appears to be based on a Pennsy prototype. I'd say it's around the same size as Bachmann's 2-8-0, but that's just a recollection from seeing one at a train show a while back.

Why do you think Muslim Americans are less homophobic than Middle Easterners? 

If the entirety of the Middle East are as stable economically as Europe and East Asia, then I guarantee you that culturally, it'd be a much less racist, less homophobic and less misogynist than it is right now.

In fact, America's pick and choose foreign policy in the Middle East is what's destroying the Middle East itself. America is protecting a Saudi kingdom based on a radical form of Islam that beheads homosexuals for crying out loud.

&gt; The AK Party, formed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, failed to retain its majority in June&amp;#039;s poll, and attempts to form a coalition government since then have proved unsuccessful.

&gt; Mr Erdogan has promised a return to stability if his party wins a majority.

&gt; If the AK Party again fails to secure a single-party majority in the 550-seat parliament, it may be forced back to the negotiating table with either the country&amp;#039;s main secularist CHP opposition or the nationalist MHP. At June&amp;#039;s election, Mr Erdogan sought a two-thirds majority to turn Turkey into a presidential republic, but his Islamist-rooted AK Party fell short.

Simply put, a steady rise of corruption and mismanagement eroded away at the empire's stability, prosperity and influence. Its size and mutli-ethnicity meant large amounts of local autonomy, resulting in ever decreasing revenue and control from the state. As the West went through the Renaisance, Enlightenment and Industrial revolution, the Ottomans were paralysed fighting rebellion, corruption and an increasingly dysfunctional empire. That's ignoring the threats it faced from without.

ServetusM,72,72,1446370777,1446352961,,"What happens in Guantanamo...

1.) Is very different (It's bad but..), it is a huge false equivalence to believe it is ""as bad"". Young girls don't have their sexual organs mutilated there. People aren't run over by tanks, or lit on fire. Children aren't forced to execute people by the dozens (And in turn no children are executed or held there--while plenty of children are killed in the middle east because their parents believe in the wrong sky wizard). What happens to those prisons is awful and absolutely barbaric, but it is not comparable to what happens in the throes of Middle Eastern extremism. 

2.) The suspected crimes are typically far different. No one there is extradited from the EU or the U.S. proper, they were all captured in war zones (The man in this story was captured in Afghanistan.) This does not EXCUSE,  AT ALL what happened. However, every man in there is suspected of some kind of actual crime, where the intent was to harm people or assets (Again, not an excuse, especially if we refuse to charge them. But remember again, many of these men were literally pulled from Taliban safe houses.)

This is GROSSLY different than people being tossed off roofs (Iraq) or hung by cranes (Iran) or decapitated (Saud) for merely being homosexual. It is a TON different for being decapitated or stoned to death for practicing ""witch craft"". It is VERY different than being tortured for simply blogging about unfair practices of the state or questioning absolute belief in Sharia. It is very different than being executed for using a graven image of Muhammad. It is MASSIVELY different than being stoned to death or lashed because you were raped. 

There is no comparison in the level which these abuses happen in--in the U.S. and the West you need to leave a country, enter an active combat zone, actively fight against the U.S. and THEN you are held without trial, you are also tortured psychologically and with methods that don't produce grievous physical injuries (Water boarding, sleep deprivation ect--again, this is NOT a defense of these things, but they are different.)...In the middle east you can be taken **FROM YOUR HOME**, for simply **saying** the wrong thing. You can be held for just as long, and tortured with long lasting grievous physical injuries (Skin stripping lashes, electrical ect) and THEN executed. To date no one that has been held without trial at Guantanamo has been executed (And certainly not the gruesome executions of stoning, beheading and fire you see in the middle east.)


Listen, the U.S. should absolutely be ashamed of Guatonomo. It is a clear failure of our own ideals, and that is not acceptable, and shouldn't be acceptable. But comparing a prison built due to the extreme irregularity of your own citizens renouncing their citizenship and fighting in a holy war, which does not execute said citizens? To regimes which use execution and torture for crimes that don't even exist, like fucking witch craft? Is laughable. 

No, how does hyperbole help us? 

Edit: To add too, another thing is the torture at Gitmo came to an end. Years ago (About 7) prisoners were given access to lawyers, and third party advocates and then given yard time, entertainment and other amenities. Most of the prisoners 600+ of the 775 were released. This all happened just a couple years after the U.S. public got wind of it. I say this to show that the U.S. found what happened in its prison system abhorrent and worked quickly to change it, now Gitmo still being open is terrible, and we have work to do, but a lot of the original horrors of the facility were fixed. This is in STARK contrast to most of the horrors listed in the middle east, which have been escalating steadily. It shows a pretty fundamental difference in how both sides handle when they commit a crime, the U.S. people demanded it be made public, and began work to fix it. These crimes in the middle east? Well, more witches will be executed this year than in Salem. =-/ and the killing of the ""wrong faiths"" and homosexuals and other innocents has only been increasing. It's not comparable.

And now to get to the point:

1) Aboriginal land doesn't appear in *any* of the provincial land title systems, such as myLTSA, BC Assessment, or Teranet.

2) Second paragraph from [here](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-expands-aboriginal-title-rights-in-unanimous-ruling/article19347252/):

&gt; &gt; In what legal observers called the most important Supreme Court ruling on aboriginal rights in Canadian history – a culmination of all previous rulings – the court determined that native Canadians still own their ancestral lands, unless they signed away their ownership in treaties with government.

3) Fourth paragraph from [here](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-expands-aboriginal-title-rights-in-unanimous-ruling/article19347252/):

&gt; &gt; “The doctrine of terra nullius [that no one owned the land prior to European assertion of sovereignty] never applied in Canada,” the court said in an 8-0 ruling, written by Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin.

4) Fifth and thirteenth paragraphs from [here](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-expands-aboriginal-title-rights-in-unanimous-ruling/article19347252/):

&gt;  &gt; Government still has a right to intrude but only if it can reconcile aboriginal interests with wider public purposes – which can include mining and logging projects and, though the court didn’t say so specifically, the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline from Alberta to the B.C. coastal community of Kitimat.

&gt; &gt; ...

&gt; &gt; The Supreme Court elaborated in some detail on how government, resource companies and aboriginal communities with title claims could try to work things out in the new era of aboriginal title. It said government needs a compelling purpose to intrude, and its purpose must be considered from the aboriginal perspective, not just that of the wider public. Ultimately, intrusions will be judged on how they serve reconciliation between aboriginal peoples and the wider population.

As for GG, I do not strictly oppose inclusiveness in gamer culture. I do oppose its forcible imposition on those who have no interest in it, but I definitely feel those who want a more inclusive culture based on diversity have every right to pursue that desire for those that wish to partake. If anything, I DO feel gaming journalism (specifically the publications GG has gotten upset over) has had some of its writers trying to impose their cultural views and desires without proper warning in advance (my soon to be published Medium article examining Leigh Alexander's ""Gamers Are Over"" article gives this further analysis) and thus many of those who have no desire for said inclusive culture feel angered and betrayed, hence all the resultant hostility, and while I condemn some of the ways said rage has manifested (harassment is NEVER acceptable for one), I believe the anger is understandable to an extent.

Or if you want you can visit Antigua (above south america) where a lot of the slaves were taken for conditioning and find more information on the journey of the slaves, there are many books on Antigua on how the slaves originally got there, where they came from, and what their life was like in Africa beforehand. 

But if you feel strongly on this you're welcome to visit the [Hale Center on OSU campus](http://odi.osu.edu/hale-black-cultural-center/) (where I work) and discuss otherwise with me in person. Or call up/e-mail professors of the african-american and african studies department at ohio state, call d. m.- a professor there. Or you can visit the W.E.B. Dubois Center in Ghana (It's located in the capital city of Accra) and find information on not only slavery from before his time but also more Pan African history. ALl of which you will information that the comment previous to yours is more accurate. 

Also, and this is important. Africa is not a country. So when you discuss ""Africa"" as a whole in the context of slavery it doesn't make sense. There was NO whole African unit or united. Africa was not a single country or entity. Africans were not selling “their own”, they were selling their enemies, just as the Greeks and Romans once did. Africa, then as now, was made up of different city-states/countries. You need to stop  considering Africa (as a whole) as a homogeneous ethnic and political entity.


I would suggest the books ""*Encyclopedia of African American History*"" by Dr. Rucker (who was my resident director in study abroad to ghana) and also by Dr. leslie ALexander from Ohio State, *Introduction to the History of African Civilization*  by Magbaile Fyle from West Africa and former Ohio State professor in slave history, *Major Problems in African American History* by Holt &amp; Brown, and also the book *The Atlantic Slave Trade* by Northrup is pretty good ""prisoners taking in war- at least such as are taken in open and declared war, when one kingdom avows hostilities against another (again not tribes, kingdoms, city-states), are generally of this description....Thus, when Mansong, KING of Bambarra, made war upon Kaarta he took in one day nine hundred POWsof which number not more than seventy were free men."" 

Sometimes where free men were taken as slaves, their friends would ransom them for let's say two slaves...but if you were already a slave POW, you had no chance for this ransom. So freemen had a distinct advantage over POWs that were already slaves before and during warring. 

""A freeman may, by the established **customs** of kingdoms in Africa, become a slave by being taken in war. War is, of all others, the most productive source, and was probably the origin of slavery, for when one nation had taken from another, a greater number of captives than could be exchanged on equal terms, the conquerers finding it inconvenient to maintain their pows would compel them in labour, at first, perhaps, for their only support, but afterwards to support their masters. Be this as it may, it is a known **fact** that prisoners of war in kingdoms in Africa are the slaves of the conquerers, when the weak or unsuccessful warrior, begs for mercy beneath the uplifted spear of his opponent, he gives up at the same time his claim to liberty; and purchases his life at the expense of his freedom..."" -----edited by Northrup *Atlantic Slave Trade* book. 

There were also two distinctly different kinds of war throughout Africa which is also important to know regarding slavery and the slave trade to european slavers. 

If you want to know more I can also discuss the politics involved with the numerous kingdoms, city-states, and villages throughout Africa pre 1900 and colonialization. I'm not trying to be an asshole because I know you like the Buckeyes and so do I being born in Columbus, but your comment is wrong and I felt compelled to say something. Still if you feel you're right you may come to the Hale Center and discuss further with me, or go to the [African American And African Studies department](https://aaas.osu.edu/) and discuss your claims with them and some of the professors there. You can probably sit in on a class if you want and learn this stuff as well. They are very nice there. 

If you want to experience West African culture in Columbus there is a nice restaurant called Dreyleyse off 161 where they even have some shitto sauce and Star Beer. You can get some fufu with peanut soup. ",todayilearned,0,t3_3qzccg,,1447326478,0,,t1_cwk34wf,t5_2qqjc,cwk67xt,

&gt;characters that wouldn't fit the setting

It's YOUR setting.  It is your world to make full and rich with a multitude of different perspectives.  What's making you stumble in this is your cultural conditioning, to be generous.  You make the plausibility of the setting.  

Part of this may depend on what you're leaving out, of course, or what your lore is centered around; garb from tropical climates isn't going to work in snow or colder weather, if that's a thing, and it can definitely affect foods.  But skin color?  Religion?  Sexuality?  Family relationships, or property law?  Melanin doesn't have to work that way.  One god or many (or none) is variable across the globe.  And reproduction or societal gender mapping is not some zero-sum thing where a minority member of sexual preference or gender is going to poison fertility for the entire tribe (unless you make it that way, at which point it's not 'realistic' anyway).

And guess what?  Darker-skinned people did exist in Europe.  Religion was and is a very complex thing, with lots of different beliefs in the mix.  Women did sometimes own property, depending on the region.  And minorities of sexual preference or gender identity have been referenced across different cultures for millennia.  Including such ideas is historic, not histrionic pandering.

And this is especially true if you identify something as fantasy.  Not just fiction, but fantasy.  You are claiming a distinct departure from reality while still keeping your misunderstandings and limited data to justify not having to research very deeply or stretch your worldmaking.  You can't have your cake and eat it, too, as the saying goes.  

If a dev wants to stick with their comfort zone, if they're making it to a particularly narrow focus, okay?  But people don't have to humor it, they don't have to buy it, and the act of comment and criticism isn't 'forcing' that.  It's holding people accountable to their creative choices with money and attention, which is how it should be.  No one is owed money or praise because they personally think their work was 'good enough'.",GamerGhazi,0,t3_3r0rrt,,1447326584,0,,t1_cwk5zg5,t5_33oia,cwk6g1k,

Patrice Evra is honing skills in Italy and aims to be a boss in England.

Patrice Evra is learning absorbing much as he can at JuventusPatrice Evra is learning absorbing much as he can at Juventus (Paul Cooper)
PATRICE EVRA was still recovering from the shock of Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement when “The Boss” played a significant part in resculpting Evra’s own future. Their conversation came near the end of the 2012-13 season, when Manchester United won the title by 11 points.

Ferguson: “Patrice, two people are going to be great managers in this team. You and Ryan Giggs.”

Evra: “Come on, boss!”

Ferguson: “Patrice, trust me because you understand football, you know how to talk to people, you’ve got the leadership. Forget tactics and everything; you know how to pass on your passion. You can easily pass on your inspiration, your leadership. Trust me — do your badges.”

Evra, who was about to turn 32, had not considered management until then. Before that season had finished he was coaching academy players. Now in his second year at Juventus, Evra regards his concluding years as an elite-level player as an observation course in Serie A tactics and preparation. “I am like a computer, I’m trying to absorb everything.”

When Ferguson spoke, you listened. The way his captain tells it, there was no point arguing when a halt was called to a quarter-century at Old Trafford. “I remember we talked maybe two weeks before and he said, ‘Patrice, I will be here another five years’,” says Evra, laughing. “I said. ‘Yes, boss. Let’s do it.’ I was so convinced. He was looking younger and younger, amazing. He even told me ‘99%, Cristiano Ronaldo will come’. I was like, ‘Wow, we are ready to bounce back and to even win the Champions League again’.

“After that everyone knows what happened. You know when you are lost and you feel like the world is crumbling? It was a big trauma. I felt lost.”

Ferguson had been working with Ronaldo’s representatives to bring the forward back from Real Madrid, and Ronaldo wanted the move. The decision to retire, he explained to his players, was made after a family bereavement, the death of his wife’s twin sister.

A year later, Evra himself had to face the decision: stay or go. Much has been said about the Frenchman’s transfer to Juventus 59 days after United announced a one-year extension to his contract. The standard narrative is that the left-back was too old; that the inbound Louis van Gaal preferred Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind in his position.

One reason Evra requested our interview was to let United’s supporters know why he left. The delicacy of the departure, and a desire not to offend Juve fans in detailing the pain it caused him, made Evra wait more than a year before speaking. “First of all I didn’t want to hear about any club because my club was Manchester United,” he says. “We have to be clear about that.

“David Moyes had said to me, ‘I really want you to stay because you are my captain’. I explain, ‘But I have got a family problem and it will be difficult for me to stay’. After that I met [executive vice-chairman] Ed Woodward, ‘Patrice, I know your problem, your agent told me about it, but I can’t lose you. You are such an important figure at the club.’”

Evra, whose wife wished to leave England, thanked Woodward and requested some time to think. While he was on holiday United announced that contract extension. His deal included an option for another year, and the club exercised it.

“Juventus had already talked to me. The challenge was so exciting. [Juve coach Antonio] Conte had called me a lot during the World Cup. It was not difficult to go to Juventus, because it is such a big, historic club. But it was difficult to leave Manchester United.

“Ryan Giggs called me and said ‘Come on Patrice, if you want, you can talk with [Louis] Van Gaal’. I say, ‘OK, but I am really upset and let’s see.’ Ed Woodward called me and said again ‘Patrice, I am sorry. But you have to stay, I will give you another two years contract.’ I understood he had the club’s interests at heart. I didn’t know what to do.

“The president of Juventus, Andrea Agnelli, called me and said ‘Look, we didn’t put your contract to the Italian league, you can change your mind, but we really want you here’. And I feel somebody really wants me strongly, with a lot of respect.

“After that I speak with my wife and she was ready to go, so I call Ed Woodward to say, ‘I am sorry, I already gave my word to Juventus, I can’t go back’.”

The hardest moment came when Evra went to say his farewells to a touring United team in their Los Angeles hotel. “It was one of the worst days in my life. Finally I meet Van Gaal. ‘Patrice, nice to meet you, a lot of people talk so well about you. I really want you to stay.’ I say, ‘It’s too late...’ ‘No. I have got a lot of plans for you, for you to play centre-back sometimes. Play 3-5-2.’

“And again I was thinking ‘Oh, my God.’ That’s why I don’t want to blame anybody. The only person who takes the full responsibility why I leave Man United is myself. I am the one to make the choice.”

Evra remembers looking at himself in black-and-white stripes and asking what he was doing. For two months he felt unable to give all of himself to his new team.

Slowly he began to appreciate the benefits of a training regime that demanded more than double the hours he had put in at United, a medical team that resolved a long-term health problem, and an approach to tactical preparation unlike anything he had known in reaching four Champions League finals with Monaco and United.

“I didn’t expect this,” he says. “ I learnt a lot about a way to be more professional — even if I was already a massive professional in Manchester. I was sometimes thinking, ‘You win a lot of trophies for Manchester but you could have done much more if you had known the Italian way to play.’

“I always say the Premier League is like two boxers fighting. The one who is least strong gets tired, he goes down. Here it is like a chess game, and you have to understand every move before you play with your quality, your strength, your skill. That’s the difference.”

Evra’s first season added Serie A and Coppa Italia titles to his 10 major trophies at United, and he was in the Champions League final again in May. In September, Juve went to Manchester City, fell a goal behind, but left as winners. Serie A is poised to displace the Premier League in third place in the Uefa rankings. Is he surprised?

“No. I learn a lot, and I’m a little bit worried about English football. Why? In Europe, being fast, being strong, playing only with your quality, you are going to struggle against teams that prepare. That is where England has to work, it is about tactics. But it is not easy, because the players won’t accept it.

“When Juventus played Manchester City — and it was an extra bonus of course as an ex-Red — I was not worried. Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City, when they buy expensive players a lot of people say, ‘They should win, you see all the wages he got’. But this is not the football.

“When you play against Manchester City, did any player win the Champions League in their squad? Before the game I thought, ‘In Juventus, I’ve got three or four.’ It’s not like being arrogant, but it’s just, ‘I know what I’ve got in my bag, let’s go.’

“Then before the game it’s like going into the restaurant. I say to [Massimiliano] Allegri, the coach, ‘What is on the menu today?’ Because he gives you all the information. Against City, the way we came out from the back, it was really smooth, because we train every day like that.

“When I’ve got the ball I have three solutions, I have to choose the best one. In England sometimes you’ve got the ball and you have to create something with your own skill. But in Italy they don’t leave you time to create. Allegri always says, ‘If this door is closed why go through it? Go to the open door. If that one is closed again, pass the ball back, then you go to the other door.’ That’s their philosophy, and I’m so lucky to get all of this information.”

If his luck holds, one day Evra wishes to pass that information to Premier League players. He already has the master’s seal of approval.

Kapinalliset ovat vähän kuin FSA Syyriassa. Venäjä kyllä tukee niitä, mutta ainakin kun katsoo mitä Al Jazeera yms. kertoo alueen toiminnasta, siellä on käytännössä suurten kaupunkien ulkopuolella mennyt suoraan siihen että he joilla on aseita ja taistelukykyä on valtaa ja muut jäävät alle. Tämä näkyy myös Ukrainan puolella maan takaisinvalloitetuissa itäosissa. Keskushallintoa ei kummallakaan puolella käytännössä ole, ja molemmat ovat onnistuneet ajamaan itsensä retorisiin nurkkiinsa ilman mahdollisuutta järkevään ulospääsyyn.

Sisällissota mikä sisällissota, ja molempia puolia tukee oma propagandakoneisto. Siinä näkee mitä tapahtuu kun antaa maan jakautua mielipiteiden, kielen, asenteiden ja varakkuuden puolesta kahtia niin että näiden puolten intressit jakavat myös poliittisen kentän kahtia, ja sitten pistetään kaksi suurvaltaa tappelemaan siitä kummalla on enemmän vaikutusvaltaa. Siinä on ainoa asia joka Ukrainian ja Suomen väliltä löytyy - se että yleisellä tasolla kun olet kahden suurvallan välissä, ei kannata ruveta imemään avoimesti toisen kullia ja pyllistämään toiselle. Siinä ei käy hyvin olit Ukraina tai Kuuba. Tai vaikka Suomi.

Kun katsoo Ukrainan median hysteerisia avautumisia, siellä on ihan samaa tavaraa toisesta näkökulmasta EU:n ja USA:n tukemana. Ei se siitä silti EU:n tai Yhdysvaltain mediaa tee, vaikka kuinka aivovoimistelet. Se on vain proxy-sisällisodan valitsema puoli jota tuetaan mm. rahoin, ja propaganda on aina tärkeä osa sisällissotaa jossa taistelijat voivat vaihtaa puolia.

Jos jotain positiivista asiasta pitäisi hakea, se on siinä että tuossa käy niin kuin tapaus Bäckmanin kohdalla. Kaveri laittaa itsensä pieneen marginaalimedialokeroonsa, ja hänen vaikutusvaltansa sen lokeron ulkopuolella menee täysin nollille.",Suomi,0,t3_3r156j,,1447327538,0,,t3_3r156j,t5_2qlq3,cwk8h05,

""National Bank of Greece is reviewing takeover bids for Finansbank that value its prized Turkish subsidiary at about €3bn. A sale could help the crisis-hit Greek lender meet eurozone demands to raise fresh capital.""

The leading bidder is Qatar National Bank, the acquisitive Doha-based lender that has been buying assets across Africa, the Middle East and Asia, said two people familiar with the situation.
""By inviting indicative offers for Finansbank, NBG is preparing for the European Central Bank to complete its asset quality review and stress tests of Greek banks to determine how much extra capital they need later this month.""

When eurozone negotiators agreed Greece’s debt bailout in August, they allocated €10bn-€25bn towards recapitalising the Greek banking system after it suffered a massive run on deposits as clients feared a departure from the eurozone.

While other Greek banks are hoping to raise extra capital required from stock market investors, NBG could cover much or all of its shortfall identified by the ECB with the sale of Finansbank. NBG said no decision would be taken until the ECB had published the results of its stress tests.

One Greek adviser said of NBG’s plan to sell Finansbank: “They have this fantastic silver bullet that none of the other Greek banks have, but how they play it remains to be seen.”

AUSTRIA

The Tag
Civilised, profiterole-enjoying classical music lovers and raging Nazis.  

The Evidence
FACT
Austria remains the only country to have given the world an actual certified ex-Nazi as UN Secretary General, in the form of Kurt Waldheim.

This is him doing what we all do when we're young and reckless: joining the SA. No biggie, Kurt.

FACT
Even after it had been sensationally revealed that he was a former Nazi volunteer, Austrians STILL elected Waldheim as their President. It was almost as if they all secretly knew already.

FACT
Austrians didn't just vote for the far-right politician Jorg Haider. They voted for him in droves: 27 percent in all. So alarmed was the rest of Europe with his policies that, in the year 2000, 11 countries broke off diplomatic links when he formed a coalition government. Haider was such a frothing arch-nationalist that he sometimes dressed like this:

Verdict:
If you try and flag down a cab in Austria, it will likely turn into a spontaneous curbside Nuremberg Rally. If you ask an Austrian for a cig, he will first offer you a ""heil"".

Travel Advice
Try to avoid the more racist regions of Austria. You will be able to identify these easily on a map, as they will be the bits that are within the borders of Austria.

The Security Service, along with MI6 and GCHQ, has previously warned MPs that the ability to combat terrorism would be severely hampered without the powers.

Jack_Hat,65,65,False,1446365850,,"When white liberals stop enabling it. I'm black and white people who ""totally aren't racist"" treat me like a helpless child and seem genuinely surprised when I act a certain way. it's annoying.

If you'd open your eyes a little more, you'd see it's not ""black people"". It's black women who are msotly single mothers who had no fathers of their own. These are the people that walk around with weave and perm in their head so that their hair looks more european, and they're the same people who have a problem when white women do something that's a ""black style"" yet 90% of them wear wigs and weaves all day everyday that looks like white women's hair. 

Black people in general mostly get stuck in this high schooler mentality and never grow up.The women as more susceptible to this and given that 75%+ of black mothers are single what does that tell you? They're the ones raising most of the black kids who eventually become adults. So you have this endless cycle of shitty behavior. But just like with white people, men get blamed for everything, and women have zero responsibility. they can have 6 kids with 5 different men and then men all called dead beats while the mother is strong and independent collecting welware checks so she can buy more weave that cost hundreds of dollars instead buying her child piano lessons or saving for college.

If you're really serious about wanting learn about why so many black people are in this huge bubble of ignorance, there are plenty of videos out there on youtube showing all sides. You have these fake ""pro black"" black people behind the Black Lives Matter people who promote violence and are the main ones that make fun of decent black people by calling them Uncle Tom and ""Crispy"" and such. Then you have black people who actually analyze things and speak their opinions on the situation objectively and make sense of the non-sense and point out the hypocrisies.

It boils down to the liberal media and ignorant but vocal black people pushing this idea that white people are holding us down. It's bullshit. Black people keep other black people down. I went to school with people like Mike Brown all my life and people like that are more likely to kill me and not a single black person outside my family would care, much less the media. Did you hear how many black people were murdered in Chicago this week? Last week? A lot. You didn't hear about it, because black lives don't matter unless a white person takes it. This whole overly PC trend is just fueling this crap. Whats really fucked up is that people like me will have a ton of white people tell me that I'm a sell out and am trying to pander to white people because i refused to support black criminals who get shot by white cops. Yes, white criminals do get more of a chance that black criminals *sometimes*, but the fact remains, if anyone is being attacked, shooting them should always be okay because tasers have a low chance of working and have resulting in many cops getting hurt or killed. And you should have the right to use excessive force because the point is to stop them from harming you.


 Black people need to separate themselves from these ignorant child-minded ""black people"" or else we'll just continue to be dragged back down by the people we try to lift up. White people know how to leave behind shitty white people, black people need to do the same. But nope, a lot of black people want to support criminals like Mike Brown and Travon, but have NOTHING to say about the black man who was shot by a cop for reaching for his wallet after the cop told him to. Everyone freaking about the **18** year old 10th grader who was tackled by the cop, but no one is talking about black teen who got in a fist fight with a black cop *in the same freaking school*.


To the white people, you think you're upset about the shit black people do? Black people are frustrated with this and have been since the 70's on a level you can't even begin to relate to. it's like that creepy uncle you have and everyone knows he's creepy, but they keep inviting him to events and also he's like 80-90% of everyone in your family. idk. just look at the Chris Rock stand up routine. it's true, but like, in an understatement sort of way.",AskReddit,0,t3_3r0bfx,,1447327985,0,,t1_cwjxkvp,t5_2qh1i,cwk9f5z,

Edit: Also interesting how you mentioned Europe.

The British census of 1871 reported 58,255 Muslims in Akyab District. By 1911, the Muslim population had increased to 178,647.[46] The waves of migration were primarily due to the requirement of cheap labour from British India to work in the paddy fields. Immigrants from Bengal, mainly from the Chittagong region, ""moved en masse into western townships of Arakan"". To be sure, Indian immigration to Burma was a nationwide phenomenon, not just restricted to Arakan.[47]

Historian Thant Myint-U writes: ""At the beginning of the 20th century, Indians were arriving in Burma at the rate of no less than a quarter million per year. The numbers rose steadily until the peak year of 1927, immigration reached 480,000 people, with Rangoon exceeding New York City as the greatest immigration port in the world. This was out of a total population of only 13 million; it was equivalent to the United Kingdom today taking 2 million people a year."" By then, in most of the largest cities in Burma, Yangon, Sittwe, Pathein and Mawlamyine, the Indian immigrants formed a majority of the population. The Burmese under the British rule felt helpless, and reacted with a ""racism that combined feelings of superiority and fear.""",worldnews,0,t3_3r1882,,1447328221,0,,t1_cwk9tnf,t5_2qh13,cwk9x3e,

Talon42,5,5,False,1446371911,predator,"I've seen traceroutes like the one you're talking about on the forums and it is not the smoking gun you're looking for, because the final destination responds just fine. This paragraph is telling you why that is:
&gt; The numbers are growing - if 50% of my packets are lost before it even left Europe, then 100% of them cannot arrive at destination in Boston, the same goes for latency - if it takes 50 ms to go through first five waypoints, it cannot reach the 6th in 40 ms. In the image you see some minor fluctuations which contradicts this rule - they are caused when some router on the way decides not to reply to test packet, or it takes him longer to reply then the packet spends on the way - this is not a problem for us, just consider it random subspace fluctuation and focus on big picture.  


Let me rephrase. **Packet loss or high return times are not indicative of a problem unless they continue through the route.** This is because in order to reach a certain router packets have to travel through the entire route before it, so logically if one router shows high ping and packet loss the rest of the route should reflect it.  

These anomalies appear, because of how routers handle the packets used for ""ping"" or ""tracert"". Basically routers are very efficient at routing packages, but they are not designed to respond themselves. Every time you ""ping"" (ICMP echo) or ""tracert"" (ICMP exceed) the router itself has to respond, which is handled in the control plane of the router for most models. Since this isn't supposed to be the main function it's relatively low on resources. So in order to protect the other functions that are happening in the control plane responding to your ping request is at the very bottom of its priority list. Pretty much all routers also implement rate-limiting, which limits the amount of ping requests it will answer. Some even drop them completely. (Depending on the settings a bunch of angry nerds tracerouting may already be enough to run into the rate-limiting.) Both of these things may cause additional latency or packet loss to show up, which is why you ignore isolated timeouts or ""problem"" routers in a traceroute.  

There are other fun things that can mess with your traceroute, like asymmetric routes or load balancing. So please be aware that traceroute is a great diagnostic tool, but you have to be very aware of its shortcomings.  

If you want to know more [here](http://cluepon.net/ras/traceroute.pdf) is a very exhaustive guide on how to use traceroute.

Outro ponto importante, o empresário é quem **recolhe** o imposto, quem **paga** é sempre o consumidor, portanto, como escrevi antes, comprar do aliexpress ou baixar filme pirata é sonegar. Quando o empresário não transfere ao governo, possivelmente ele não te cobrou este imposto em sua formação de preço de venda. Portanto, quando você pede desconto, está dizendo: ""se eu sonegar, fica mais barato?""",brasil,0,t3_3r00x6,,1447328742,0,,t3_3r00x6,t5_2qh9i,cwkb0y3,

When they monitored over 1000 people from isolated tribes in Africa and South America, they found they all seemed to sleep for a solid 6.5 hours:

&gt;While some European documents suggested that people used to wake up for a while during the night, sleeping in two shifts, the researchers found this was not the case with the hunter gatherers.

These tribes did not have electricity, which is what was blamed for ending 'segemented sleep'.

VanMerwan,24,24,False,1446375925,,"It is often three things:

- Esperanto itself. It is really something different. The vocabulary is European, but the agglutination system is very Asian (I am quoting Claude Piron). Esperanto was made to be easy, and discovering how Zamenhof did to make it as easy as possible is fascinating.

- It makes your present and future languages stronger. The word in the Esperanto vocabulary is often the most common word in European languages. It is a big boost if you plan to learn other European languages. There are a limited number of vocabulary roots to learn, on which you can add affixes to express almost anything. Exemple: san/ is the root for health. san-a = healthy. san-e = healthy-ly. san-o = the health. mal-san-o = a sickness. mal-san-ul-o = a sick person. mal-san-ul-ej-o = a place for sick people = a hospital. This system forces you to understand the essence of what you are saying. There are a lot of words in French and English I did not understand before reading the Esperanto constructed version.

- The ability to quickly speak fluently with people from all other the world. I caught some people who just finished their Esperanto tree in DiscordApp and GoSpeaky. They are all amazed by how much they can express.

My favorite thing is this quote from Wikipedia: The Institute of Cybernetic Pedagogy at Paderborn (Germany) has compared the length of study time it takes natively French-speaking high-school students to obtain comparable 'standard' levels in Esperanto, English, German, and Italian.[61] The results were:
**2000 hours studying German = 1500 hours studying English = 1000 hours studying Italian (or any other Romance language) = 150 hours studying Esperanto.**
It is the level for the French Baccalauréat. Something we get when we are around 16/17/18 years old.

- I actually forgot a fourth category: the idealists, who want a International Auxiliary Language that is more inclusive and does a better job than English.

People are often a mix of the four. ",duolingo,0,t3_3r29q9,en fr eo,1447328918,0,,t3_3r29q9,t5_2t6ze,cwkbed3,

Also, this is Amsterdam RLD. You might get lucky and find a nice, relaxed provider, but in my experience you're walking into a tourist trap cash grab orgasm factory. Here's some rant.

Know what you want.
You'll have to set the details of the encounter *very* explicitly. A suck and fuck is 50euro, but that'll get you 15 minutes including taking off and putting clothes back on. That leaves 10 minutes of her spending an outrageously small amount of effort in getting you hard. Not hard, and with bad odds, you'll get an exasperated stare or a get-on-with-it wave. Some girls don't let you touch your dick after the condom is on.

Blowjob tends to be short, perfunctory and lackluster. Only there because it was part of the deal. Then it's on to rutting and in whatever position she decides. Unless you've asked for a position in which case she might say no, I only do on top. Beware the risk of half-dick-inside positions, they happen and you won't get a happy girl if you attempt to go deeper.

Pump and dump and leave. You've paid pocket change for a second of her time, and again unless you've found a solid and generous provider you're there to get your stuff done and then leave. They get grumpy fast. They are grumpy already.

*Everything* is notarised here. You pay for suck and fuck, and that does not include touching her tits most of the time, or even a blowjob longer than a few minutes tops, or your choice of positions. This is RLD, if you want more than one smile you'll pay for it.

So you step up, she smiles and asks 'what would you like?' and if you don't have a detailed list of how the encounter is supposed to play out, you get shortchanged. And beware that the more things you add to the list and if that goes beyond the 15-20 minutes, you'll be paying out your ass. Prices sound cheap, but they're not. If you say half hour and have a list of expectations, they're about as expensive as Scandinavia, with worse service.

In my nine years in the hobby I've never come across such poor odds of good service among so many bombshell ladies. Stay away from the RLD.

It being Amsterdam there's a few more options, but surprisingly few for the reputation. Find some privehuises or private houses and visit those. Even then the routines are odd compared to other countries. Half-dick-inside positions with her on her back and her legs in the way. Strange, but you have no say without the cash at hand. BBBJ is rarely available.

Find the brothels, is my advice. Travel to the border brothels if anyting, i.e go to Germany, they've set up establishments just outside the borders.

How to behave? You won't have time to 'impress' her with anything. Be polite, corteous, smile and know what you want and state it clearly. She'll move your hands away from where you can't put them. Have a hard on ready quickly, and take a shower. Don't dress complicated, you're wasting her time.

You've chosen the most impersonal market in Europe, imo. Try it out, but get ready to have some interesting experiences and I'm not talking about the sex.

tl;dr, I don't like Amsterdam RLD, or the cities services in general. Cool place though, if you like to party.",Hookers,0,t3_3r1cvx,,1447329012,0,,t3_3r1cvx,t5_2se57,cwkbljo,

Cannot testify quality of product yet, but vials are clean, sealed and have the same level of content.

Packaging was handwritten and in a regular back, could damage the vials at some point.

*What do I look for in a vendor:*

1. Quick PM responses and elegant customer service.
2. Vendor sends confirmation of order – even a simple note back saying, ""payment received, product shipped"" is adequate, 
3. Price value — a reflection of good pricing, relatively speaking.
4. Professionalism and courtesy are always valued, even in the busted-ass, dank, no-JavaScript-havin' back alleys of the Interwebs.
5. Stealth is a clear indicator of a vendor's quality, caution, intelligence &amp; general competence at her job.
6. The product should be packaged safely &amp; appropriately – fragile items in padding, flat items in envelopes

Lincoel,1,1,False,1446384041,,"Yes!!!!!  In fact, Americans wrote the Japanese Constitution.  But they were also sensitive to the history of Japan.  There is overwhelming evidence that the US government chose to whitewash the Emperor's involvement in war crimes so that they could get the reforms the people to accept the reforms they wanted.  For instance, when they gave women legal rights (women didn't have ANY legal rights under the Meiji Constitution), the Japanese leadership just about had a hissy-fit, but MacArthur pushed it through anyway.  Notably, the original MacArthur driven constitution had a unicameral legislature, but that was changed by the Japanese to bicameral.  I do want to point out that the Americans gave the Japanese cabinet to the Emperor the opportunity to write their own Constitution, but they keep submitting glossed over version of the Meiji Constitution, so finally MacArthur just told his team to write a version.

Germany was a very different story.  First, one has to consider how Germany was influenced by the Marshall Plan.  Without it, one has to wonder how many Europeans might have starved to death.  So, for Germans saw America as a life-line.  America was also seen as their safety from the Soviets.  But Germany, in 1948 (when the process for writing the Constituion) was being governed by a coalition of the Americans, British, and French.  Germany's old Weinmar Constitution had also functioned until the rise of Nazism, so it became the starting point for their new  Constitution.  But there is considerable influence from America in there, because Germans wanted change that was meaningful.

America post-WW2 had bigger fish to fry than micro-manage other countries.  We were on a collision course with Communism.  Today, it is hard to recall just how dangerous Communism was.  America also was sensitive to not being a bully.

Just keep playing cat-and-mouse with their main stacks, pick off their stragglers and fight with all you've got (mercs, loans) until they offer you peace deals. Improve relations with them after the war. I managed to get France as an ally up til my betrayal of them in the 1720s for Paris.

Immediately after the war, I reformed the religion (this brings your mil tech up significantly) and started westernisation, with a stockpile of 2000+ adm and diplo points and 1000 of mil points. (with the exception of mil tech, don't bother teching up beyond adm lvl 5 before reforming religion, because the ""jump"" in tech from reforming religion is based on/relative to the european nation, rather than your own tech levels) Westernisation took 20 years, and I was not attacked during that time, but if I was, my military was strong enough to defend.

Use it to build a big fleet (around 20-30 heavies, 30 transports). If you have the common sense DLC, you can further boost gold production by spending diplo points on gold provinces.

In my next war on Spain (calling in France as an ally) I completely wrecked Spain with France's help and took back those four provinces for a mere 4 warscore, and released aragon as my vassal. From then on it got much easier.

ROUYN-NORANDA | Dzierkals Martins was the first round pick of the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies at the last European draft. Within weeks, he has become an important member of the pack and a darling of the supporters player. Unknown Rouynorandiens of last May, Martins Dzierkals has quickly made a name for arriving in the capital of copper. The 22nd European choice of the Canadian Hockey League, Dzierkals landed in Abitibi for training camp in mid-August. ""I always wanted to play in Canada. I think the best junior league is here. It was a dream for me to come play. As I want to play in the NHL, I knew I had to come and play in North America, ""said the number 10 of the pack. The 6-foot, 165-pound was also selected by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the third round last June. ""I was proud to be with the Huskies, said Martins Dzierkals. It was the first team that contacted me. I liked the attitude of the team towards me. People from the organization even came to see me in Switzerland. I could not ask for better than to be here in Rouyn-Noranda Huskies with. "" 


Cultural differences Of course, the Latvian striker has faced some difficulties when arriving in North America. Still, Dzierkals Martins could not be happier than to be in Rouyn-Noranda to play hockey. ""What struck me when I got off the plane, is to see all the houses. In fact, there is virtually as houses. At home, there are many more apartments. Another thing that impressed me is the fact that people drive large trucks. It's something you do not really see in Latvia "", he mentioned. Hockey is the most popular sport in Latvia. ""Latvians are crazy about hockey, underlined Martins Dzierkals. They support players from our country. I know that even if I am in Rouyn-Noranda, there are many people who follow my path and learn about what I do. "" How to practice hockey is not quite the same in Latvia. ""I understood that I had to adapt my style of play. Here, speed is faster and it is important to finish the hits. I would say that in Europe we used a system where one `` chipait`` the puck to make zone inputs. "" 


Build a family What was the most difficult for Martins Dzierkals is to leave his family in Latvia. ""This is the first time I also find myself away from my family for a long period of time, he said. I have six siblings and I miss them. I must say that I have a truly outstanding host family. My foster parents were able to put me at ease and I feel like a whole new family. I also miss my city and be able to speak my language. Nevertheless, I am happy to realize my dream to play hockey in Canada and I have no regrets. "" The Latvian striker also stressed the importance of his teammates in integration. ""I was surprised at how much they immediately took care of me. They are real friends. They are there when I need them and they often help me to translate into English. During training or parts, it's going well. My English is quite good and theirs too. Anyway, when talking hockey, using the vocabulary of hockey. This is enough for us to understand. "" 


High aspirations When it came his goals for the season, Martins Dzierkals first spoke of the goals of his team. ""We have a good team this year and I think we can dream of going further, he added. It is perhaps still early, but my goal is that we can participate in the Memorial Cup tournament. "" Since the beginning of the season, Latvian has given several opportunities to supporters Huskies to remember his visit to Rouyn-Noranda. In 12 games, he scored 9 times and has accumulated 11 assists. It is among the 20 top scorers of the QMJHL and is one of the leaders for winning goals with 4. His performances on the ice reflect his personal goal. ""When I landed in America after being drafted by the Leafs, nobody knew who was Martins Dzierkals.

Well, most people say Richard the III was less than charming: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_in_the_Tower

The way Richard II put down the Peasant's Revolt was fairly uncivilized, and there must have been a reason why they were revolting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasants%27_Revolt

In fact, here's a list of just some of the revolts against monarchy from that period: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_revolt_in_late-medieval_Europe

As for the longed for combination of monarchy and church, would you really have wanted to live under Richelieu?

""Military expenses placed a considerable strain on the King's revenues. In response, Richelieu raised the gabelle (salt tax) and the taille (land tax). The taille was enforced to provide funds to raise armies and wage war. The clergy, nobility, and high bourgeoisie were either exempt or could easily avoid payment, so the burden fell on the poorest segment of the nation. To collect taxes more efficiently, and to keep corruption to a minimum, Richelieu bypassed local tax officials, replacing them with intendants (officials in the direct service of the Crown).Richelieu's financial scheme, however, caused unrest among the peasants; there were several uprisings in 1636 to 1639. Richelieu crushed the revolts violently, and dealt with the rebels harshly.""

People read romances and take them seriously. They read ""The Once and Future King"" instead of ""Le Morte d'Arthur."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Malory

It's hard to blame them, those stories are way more pleasant. And the stories of monarchy then were written by those who could afford to learn to read and write, which was often less than 2% of the population: the wealthy and some (by no means all)  of the clergy.

Hobbes was right: life then was nasty, brutish and short. But he was wrong about Leviathan, the stories are less about acceptance of tyranny, and more about constant revolts and civil wars, violently put down. People postulate some kind of romantic dreamtime which never existed.

A short version is that NA is completely free and EU requires you to either grind a bit or pay a bit of money to get a gold pack to access some game features. Farming the gold is pretty easily done by the time you hit level cap, though, so this shouldn't be a big determining factor for you.

Latency is a big factor in this game so the best latency is probably where you should play. However, if you somehow get around 100 latency from EU to NA with a ping reducer program like WTFast, I highly suggest considering it \o/

Population wise EU is &gt; NA but NA is still populated enough to have hundreds of people at sieges and stuff and have thousands on at primetime so it's not 'dead'.

They make great managers, etc. because their parents don't baby talk to them, teach them financial and time management skills from an early age, as well as public speaking skills, and they nurture whatever potential their offspring may have, whether it's music, acting, and so on.

At best, they achieve top managerial positions, but they simply are not invited to the top levels, which has always been populated by European royalty and nobility, which itself historically hired Jews to do accounting work, because Christianity disallowed anything to do with usury.

submarshal,9,9,1446389379,1446388961,Cena,"Okay, but first it's important to understand what capitalism is since you can't understand socialism without it.

The main observation behind socialism is that capitalism divides society into two distinct classes defined by their social relations to each other - the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Under capitalism, the means of production (factories, farmland, offices etc and other tools and resources required for production) are owned privately by the bourgeoisie. A proletarian is someone who has to sell his labor for wages to a bourgeois. Since the means of production are privately owned, a proletariat has no choice but to sell his labor and produce for the bourgeois instead of producing for himself. In order for the bourgeois to make money off the work of the proletariat, he has to continuously exploit the worker by paying him less than his labor is worth in order to turn a profit. A worker may produce $10 worth every hour but is only paid $5, the rest is pocketed by the bourgeois and/or invested to further expand and grow his capital. Exploitation in production is intrinsic to capitalism, it is how it has always functioned and how it will always function. Another key thing is that a capitalist produces for exchange value, he produces for the market regardless of any moral objections or actual use value of the goods produced. Capitalism cares for one thing, and that's profit, there's no room for producing for the well-being of people and no motivation to try and meet the needs of people unless there's profit to be made. Now, an ancap might say that he has massive amounts of food readily available and that this surely shows capitalism is superior for handling complexity and meeting the needs of people. But try and ask the homeless in America who sleep outside vacant houses or the workers who sweat and toil in the shadow of the bourgeoisie's glass towers just how great capitalism is at allocating goods.

Socialism is the antimatter of capitalism. Socialism wishes to do away with private ownership of the means of production (thereby abolishing the bourgeoisie as a class and creating a classless society), it wishes to rid the world of exploitation and seeks to produce for use value rather than exchange. The working class no longer has to sell its labor to the bourgeoisie since it owns and runs the means of production and can decide what to produce and how to allocate goods. A classless society where the workers run the means of production is the most basic element of socialism and why Denmark and the rest of the Nordic countries can not be considered socialist. In Denmark and the other Nordic countries, the means of production are still owned privately by the bourgeoisie. There is still exploitation, production for the market and the working class is still entirely subject to the free market and our well being depends on the well being of capitalism. Capitalism isn't doing well in Europe today, it is struggling to recover from the 2008 crisis and, if the whispers about a 2016 recession are true, will fall even further. As a result, no matter who we vote into the Nordic parliaments will be forced to enact policies which benefit the bourgeoisie over the proletariat such as cutting welfare, education, environmental efforts and giving tax cuts to the wealthy. It's a nicer form of capitalism than that in America, I suppose, but it is capitalism nonetheless with the same old ugly face of exploitation and farce of a democracy.

────────

I have not explored enough into post-Brent to give you recommendations there, although I know there are some good 90's shows out there. You may have noticed we are all sending you to archive.org, which is your best friend as a Deadhead. Utilize the Grateful Grabber add-on, which will allow you easily download shows from the site (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grateful-grabber/oaodbbeaklbdmjcghbkcfgmioafnjbfe?utm_source=gmail). Like I said above, be sure to check out Reckoning, also add Europe 72, Nightfall of Diamonds, any of the Dave's and Dick's Picks series (some of the shows from above are from those series). There's so much out there.

Once you familiarize yourself with the sounds of the different years you will be able to explore easily on your own and find some shows of your own that will become your favorites!

Well, those are crimes. The evidence, though, that this is actually happening inside camps is very thin: claims of this sort appear to originate with a senior police officer who is known to hold extremist views, and thinks Germany should build a wall on the Austrian border to stop immigration.

&gt; expressing nazi opinions and views, on the contrary, is actually Illegal

Only if expressed in a manner that threatens public order.

&gt; The more controversial bit is really believe that if violent people commit crimes while trying to claim asylum then that should really be putting this status of needing protection under serious question.

Each case is to be judged on its own merits. When hundreds of traumatized people have to sleep together in a sports hall, punches can get thrown. But anyone -- refugee or no -- who is convicted of a crime will be dealt with.

&gt; it is true that refugees are refugees when they go to the next country and when they continue or all want to pick out a country that stretches the definition a lot.

These are people who know about as much about Europe as you or I do about the Middle East.

They've also heard of this wonderful country in the middle of Europe that *will* accept refugees and not make them beg for food, demand bribes, arrest them for no reason, or cage them like animals. There are, it is true, some other countries that would take at least some of them on, but the average Syrian hasn't heard about them. There are stories of Austrian officials intercepting migrants on their way to Germany and having to tell them, ""No, honestly, you can stay here, Austria is every bit as good as Germany.""

&gt; I believe that putting money into the refugee camps, and then taking them directly from camps and making illegal crossings harder is superior for several reasons.

That's one idea that's been floated, and it seems to have a lot of merit to it. It's certainly logical. Unfortunately, on the evidence so far, a lot of the money isn't filtering down to where it's needed.

&gt; you can pick the most vulnerable from the turkish + Jordanian safe areas and keep them safer crossing officially

That would certainly be the goal, but it's bit late to put that into effect now. Besides, these camps house dozens of thousands of refugees: it would be a mammoth task to sort through them all and prioritize them.

&gt; especially not helping out the traffickers who routinely ditch people in the sea or lock them in trucks to die in squalid conditions.

The number of Syrians using people traffickers has dropped dramatically. The news has filtered through that there are better, less costly and safer ways of getting to Germany.

&gt; it lends itself to distributing them better across europe

Yeah, Germany's more or less given up on that one. The other countries have to play ball, and they're not. That's the problem.

The lynchpin to Saddam's strategy for holding onto Kuwait rested upon his very skewed understanding of global politics and where Iraq stood within the international community. Iraq had garnered economic and military support from the various Gulf states during the Iran-Iraq War (for example, the Iraq Air Force had some dispersal airbases around the Gulf) and Saddam conflated this soft support with actual diplomatic strength. In 1989, the Saudis signed a non-aggression and military assistance pact with Iraq, and Saddam misconstrued as tacit Saudi approval of isolating Kuwait. He believed that since Iraq had protected the region from Iran, it would accept the price by acquiescing to the conquest of Kuwait. As Saddam explained to the Yemeni president in August 1990:

&gt;Iraq…who defends them [the Arabs] for ten years [and] they consider his defense as a liability against [Iraq]?…The time has come for every person to say…I’m Arabian…I’m Saddam Hussein…[If] Iraq will pay this amount of money to develop the Arab nation and to defend it [then] the other Arab countries must pay this amount of money…if they don’t we will fight them. 

Saddam had hoped that overtures to various Gulf states would fracture any attempt by the Saudis and exile Kuwaitis to form a response against his invasion. Although there was some validity to this assessment of Arab unity, Saddam woefully underestimated the fact that his use of armed force to resolve differences with Kuwait unified political opinion against him within the region.

Further afield, Saddam also did not understand the geopolitical changes that happened in 1989. In November 1990, his foreign Minister Tariq Aziz gave him optimistic reports that Gorbachev was not in favor of military action and would act to restrain the Americans:

&gt;as I have shared my opinion with you, deducing that the Soviet Union has no interest in a war of this manner happening and at this large scale. Maybe at the beginning and at different intervals the idea of a surgical [military] operation came up. [T]o hit Iraq and force it to withdraw from Kuwait, as maybe a disciplinary move for Iraq; it possibly entered their mind, but when they saw the reality and the fact that the Iraqi power was not something they could control in days or weeks and that this war will lead to major destruction in the region and to political and economic imbalance;
and because the Soviet Union is worried about Europe and has
internal problems, sir, they couldn’t imagine that the situation would explode in the Middle East, seeing that it is their southern border. If a war of this manner happens the situation will explode, the Islamic factor, the nationalistic factor, the oil, and security all these would explode….and as Primakov said to you when you met, after you told him that we would hit Israel, that that was a nightmare they didn’t want to see…[A] nightmare to the Soviet Union, not out of love or care for us, but a nightmare.

Additionally, Saddam hoped that France, which had developed economic and military ties to Iraq in the 1980s, would also break apart the Coalition. Both of these estimates were off base. Although the USSR was not happy about Gulf War, it was more preoccupied with the domestic turmoil that in hindsight was the signal of its impending breakup. A foreign intervention in the Middle East was the last thing Gorbachev needed, especially with memories of Afghanistan debacle still fresh. Aziz played up Mitterrand's ambiguous statements about the invasion and claimed that France would not jeopardize its domestic tranquility because of its large Algerian Muslim population. Attempting to use the French to split the Coalition had the opposite effect and the French behaved in a much more hardline fashion than Aziz anticipated. In some ways, Saddam learned the wrong lesson from the fall of the Berlin Wall; it made him feel that the age of the Superpowers was ending when instead it was leaving the US much greater latitude to act. 

In short, Saddam believed that if he occupied Kuwait, it would be a diplomatic and military fait acompli. Iraqi strategy was that by turning Kuwait into a large fortified area, the Coalition would naturally fracture and Iraq's occupation would be assured. In a ministerial conference of  August 1990, he said:

&gt;[W]e should focus on the historical event, such as the war between France and Germany in 1870 and during the First World War when France retrieved the Alsace Lorraine region and kept it united under regional policy laws, municipal laws, and autonomy after the First World War. France gradually extended its authority to this region until it became internationally and constitutionally part of France.

To be fair to Saddam, there were elements of his grand strategy that were viable. The problem was the Iraqi dictator had a pattern of consistently misreading his strengths. The Coalition was highly contingent upon a number of factors. Saddam thought time was on his side and to an extent he was correct. In May  1991 meeting with his senior army commanders he noted “we expected the entire world to react; we could not believe how long it took them to enter [the area].” Part of his rationale behind seizing Kuwait was that its borders were arbitrary colonial impositions and that both Arab leaders and the Arab street felt that these borders had no ultimate validity. 

While this view of the Middle East's borders was popular (and still is), Saddam's rhetoric and his actions, especially his use of military force to resolve the borders, threatened the very leaders he was trying to win over. His rationale for seizing Kuwait run roughshod over international law, Iraq had reaffirmed its earlier 1932 acceptance of Kuwait's borders in 1963 when it accepted Kuwait as a member of the Arab League. This gave any opposition to the invasion legal leverage to justify a military action.

One of the more pertinent examples of his misreading of international reaction was his handling of approximately 800 Western hostages (guests in Iraqi parlance) left inside Iraq. Saddam met with delegations from individual countries who would plea for the release of these individuals throughout August and November 1990. Based upon his statements in a Revolutionary Command Council meeting on 1 November 1990, he thought that this would create an international peace movement by making connections with other world leaders. He asserted in meetings that all he needed was to win two UNSC leaders to his side and the coalition would fall apart. What he was blind to was the fact that this hostage situation was a public relations disaster for Iraq. Saddam intended these meeting to demonstrate he was a tractable and sane leader when they often demonstrated the opposite. Here's an [archived ABC report]( http://abcnews.go.com/Archives/video/aug-23-1990-british-hostages-iraq-10799747) on how Saddam's public relations bid failed, the ""guests"" looked decidedly uncomfortable. 

Ultimately part of the problem was Saddam's only minister with extensive foreign experience was Tariq Aziz. But Aziz's connections and expertise were largely with the USSR and France. For example, Aziz was unaware of the nature of American style media questioning and conflated hard journalism with a widespread public antiwar sentiment:

&gt;these Americans are under daily [press] questioning, God help them, even the Americans, sometimes I see them being chased by the journalists…cornering a person…even [Secretary of Defense] Cheney has to give a response.

Many of Saddam's ministers shared the mistaken impression that time worked in Iraq's favor. Taha Ramadan, later Iraq's Vice President, asserted in November 1990 Revolutionary Command Council Meeting that the chances for peace were growing when in reality international opinion was growing more frustrated with Iraq. Again, much of the upper echelons of Iraq's leadership did not have much contact or experience abroad. The GMID (Iraqi military intelligence) had to rely upon Western press reports to discern the nature and scale of Coalition intentions.    

Ultimately, Joseph Sassoon sums up Saddam's situation quite aptly:

&gt;Although Saddam Hussein was astute in dealing with internal affairs he was less successful at understanding foreign powers. His inability to grasp the implications of invading Kuwait and his belief that the United States and coalition forces would not invade Iraq are two blatant examples of his misjudgement. In a pattern familiar to other dictators, the presentations of intelligence information and ideas presented by his inner circle became colored by the leader's own view, by the presenters' anticipation of what he really wanted to hear, or by fear of offending him.

The failure of the 1990 invasion to keep Kuwait and the subsequent marginalization of Iraq into a pariah state are pretty hard evidence against Saddam's competence as an international leader. In hindsight, Saddam was naive and possessed a highly mistaken grasp of foreign affairs.

Because whatever it was that those men were carrying, it didn't register on the microbe scan. But it was there. Five hallowed eyed Intel officers were proof of that, but also the sixth that didn't show any signs of disease. Commander DeSalle cursed. Operation reclamation did NOT go as anticipated up until now.  
  
""DeSalle?""  
  
And now some feeble minded cadet had thought this the perfect moment to forget rank and file as well...  
  
""I will be addressed as Commander, cadet... Who are you?""  
  
It wasn't some cadet standing in behind him. As soon as he had turned around, he was greeted by a man in an obviscator suit. It made his eyes hurt.  
  
""I'm sorry, but I'm not here to adhere to your ridiculous chain of command. I'm here to make sure that you don't make any rash decisions and plunge the Commonwealth into another dark age. Now if you would please follow me?""  
  
DeSalle sighed. It appeared he didn't have a choice even if he didn't want to follow him. With a gesture, the man lead him to one of the chambers deeper into the Porto Decontamination complex and, once inside, directed him to a seat.  
  
""Care for a drink, DeSalle?"" He politely refused while he sat down. ""Thank you, but I'm fine. I have a lot to do and not a lot of time, so I'd rather you get to the point. Why has the Commonwealth such an interest in these men? Last time I checked, the navy was tasked with anything and everything American. Or did I miss one of your votes again?""  
  
Within a split second, the obviscator suit deactivated and he was not greeted by a man, but a woman. Sporting a very, very nasty looking ocular implant. ""Please keep your disdain for your government to yourself. I am here on special Commonwealth instructions and, as with you, I have no time to play games; I'm not a politician. Now if you please would be so kind to look at the screen?""  
  
A holoscreen had just buzzed to life, showing a revolving globe. The Americas were in focus and a dotted line crossed the Atlantic from northern america to Europe.  
  
""Now, as I'm sure you're aware of the history of the Curtain and it's use, let me start by telling you why it's there in the first place. Please observe.""  
  
A zoom into a part of northern america revealed a crater. A very, very large one. DeSalle swallowed unwittingly. He had seen the craters created by molecular bombs on the Phobos test range. This one was bigger.  
  
""What you are seeing is known as the Yellowstone Caldera. It is a super volcano that wasn't supposed to erupt for another ten thousand years. However, a skirmish between the then United States of the Americas and the Korean Empire resulted in the caldera becoming unstable. Both armies used one of the last generation of tactical nuclear fusion bombs on the North American theater. Some of our sources say this is because the Korean Emperor, Kim-Hong Dung, was setting things right for wrongs he feel were imposed by a predecessor of the USotA, in a time when that country only inhabited the northern americas. The detonation of the Empire's fusion bomb..."" a vid started playing over the continent, ""caused an underground magma chamber in the old Yellowstone park to fill up faster than anticipated, even by American estimates. While their government was busy retaliating, the volcano exploded.""  
  
Another vid-overlay. It made him cringe. An area the size of the main European Commonwealth was obliterated with such force that  the complete american continent must have been shaking on its foundation. The large cities, easily visible from space, were obliterated within hours. And at that moment, the vid went dead.  
  
""That's the last image that particular satellite was able to pick up before the electromagnetic storm caused by the cataclysmic eruption cloud knocked it out. A lot of our surveillance equipment over the continent didn't make it out of that explosion and it took us a few hours to re calibrate the network and guide other satellites to the area.""  
  
Ash. The whole continent was covered in ash. Communication with it was sparse to say the least. DeSalle swallowed again. That must have been millions of dead people, if not more, within a few hours...  
  
""Before you ask: yes, the Curtain was already built at that moment. Our own scientists were not so eager to wait out for Yellowstone to erupt and instead of pooling our resources into our army like the USotA and the Empire did, we constructed the Curtain to make sure that whatever happened over there, would not reach us. At first, this is all that it did: keep the ash and soot at bay. A hundred years after the eruption, however, the African Union reported that a disease had started spreading through their lands. Their scientists soon discovered that it came from American survivors, who were still trying to make their way via the southern continent to African nations. It was not nice...""  
  
Images of the same hallowed eyed people as those he had sitting on the contamination unit flashed by. Some were seen attacking each other, relief workers, anything that moved. Others would just sit there, staring with blank faces into the camera. It was quite unsettling.  
  
""We have termed it the neo-plague. It spreads fast and is almost always lethal. If not from the disease itself, then because of the violent tendencies it awakens by stripping the emotional center of the brain from everything except aggression. The migration of American survivors into the European Commonwealth almost triggered a new mass extinction, had we not put a stop to it and activated the Curtain's full capability. Nothing can pass the Curtain except for biological matter. And that brings us to today. For a thousand years we have kept them at bay and, yes, have awaited an invasion. However, it would appear that the people there have evolved to be able to withstand the disease. It is therefore in Commonwealth interest that we take over this investigation, as my employers wish to understand what it is that makes the disease tick and to eradicate it where possible. The americas could be used for much crops, as our satellites have shown that it is still sparsely populated. Also, do not be fooled by the looks of people."" She swiped up an image of the quarantine room, with the five obviously sick Intel officers and the sixth, apparently healthy one. ""He is as much a carrier as they are and releasing him will cost the lives of many. So... Have I made my point?""  
  
DeSalle nodded in agreement. This was something he did not wish to partake in and if he could shove it into the shoes of the Commonwealth without sacrificing his own highly trained people, all the better. ""I will transfer them to your care. Porto has requested to know when they can have their harbor back? That's your thing now. By the way..."" He nodded to the globe. ""What happened to this Korean Empire? I have never heard of it?""  
  
The woman smirked. ""The predecessor to the Commonwealth, the European Union, glassed it and Kim-Hong Dung from orbit as punishment for his arrogance. What was once their peninsula is now the main supplier of solar power for the region. Oh, and before you leave,"" The woman blocked his exit. ""I need not remind you that what you have learned today is above top secret. Are we clear?""  
  
DeSalle made a tired motion with his head and lifted his hand for a handshake. ""I'm Navy, not Space Brat. I know what's at stake if anyone found out what happened, miss...""  
  
""Good. I will await your transfer of operational data. Have a good day. And it's De Rien."" She shook his hand and smiled.  
  
When DeSalle entered the canteen after he was done with all the paperwork and the transfer of the codes, he plunged down in his chair exhausted. He felt a little bit bad for those poor Intel officers, but then again they should've known that stepping inside there without proper protection was a one-way trip to hell. He grabbed a cafdrink and glared out over the harbor. *That's funny,* he thought. *Her name was nothing...*",WritingPrompts,0,t3_3qypud,,1447331633,0,,t1_cwjowzm,t5_2s3nb,cwkh0j5,

Once the legal and moral framework was set up, European settlers didn't really stop taking all that they could. And then the land typically gets redistributed in an unfair manner. Whether it's banks or the state, both institutions hand the power to determine who can own what in the hands of a few. Just look at what's happening in Zimbabwe with their land reform. 

I'm all for making it prohibitively expensive to have large tracts of land through taxation. I'm all for saddling corporations and absentee land owners with taxes. Ban agricultural practices that enable large farms to function. Instill in society a fervent disdain for people who hoard land or wealth, so that those people are shamed. If someone really wants all that land, make them pay the rest of the community for it. But simply saying ""You don't live here now,"" backed with a gun seems to betray the very notion of property rights I'd be attempting to extend to many more people.

I'm not saying it's in the same sense. I'm saying there is an underlying Crown title just as in all property.

&gt; The Supreme Court's use of the term ""intrude"" specifically refers to the Crown as interlopers when infringing upon aboriginal land. And the fact that aboriginal land doesn't appear in any provincial land title systems emphasizes this point -- aboriginal land is separate and distinct from the rest of land in Canada.

I don't see how one is a logical consequence of the other. A tenant has a right to use land even though it is owned by the landlord. The right to use land does not entail the full ownership of that land. The ruling explicitly contradicts what you're trying to argue.

&gt; And it's worth mentioning this recent Supreme Court ruling clearly indicates that aboriginals did own land before the arrival of Europeans, contrary to your claim ""that Aboriginal title crystallized at the time"" that Europeans arrived in North America.

They owned it before, but the Crown took it over. I never claimed that aboriginal title crystallized at the time European arrived in North America. I don't know why you're putting that in quotes when I never said it.",canada,0,t3_3qiw5r,,1447331821,0,,t1_cwkh6ki,t5_2qh68,cwkheyl,

Most fans agree that Yoda had the upper hand in that fight but stopped because it wasn't his destiny to stop Palpatine (Anakin bringing balance to the Force and all that). But Yoda's edge was slight.

Darth Binks is Palpatine's master and the architect of most Sith planning in all 6 movies. This puts at least Binks's force powers above Palpatine's, and by their deaths, Yoda and Palpatine were both strong enough in the Force that they didn't use lightsabers anymore. So even if Binks would get crushed by Yoda's legendary Form IV skill, lightsabers would probably not be a factor in a 1-on-1 between Force masters of such power.

So the fight would probably resemble Yoda's fight with Palpatine, where Yoda has only a slight edge. If Binks is significantly stronger than Palpatine, then Yoda probably loses, at least as of Episode III. The older, ""size matters not"" Yoda is much stronger, but we have literally zero feats for the older version of Binks he would have to face at that time.

So for Episode III, I give it to Binks narrowly, maybe 6–7/10. For Episode VI, I do think that it's impossible to determine for sure, but based on my EU knowledge, I think that Yoda would try to avoid the fight but win if Binks came directly after him and forced his hand.",whowouldwin,0,t3_3r05te,,1447331878,0,,t3_3r05te,t5_2s599,cwkhjab,

Page 1 - **Loving and having to die**



The world championships of ""League of Legends"" in Berlin brought  the two best teams in the World together. Besides pretty plush hats there was a small sensation.




Love cannot be bought, but you can gain it by playing. Nothing else want five humans from South Korea who traveled to Berlin in order to perform on the big, grand stage. Just once, they said before, people should shout their names, cheer for them, root for them. With their big glasses and fuzzy hair they could effortlessly be a boy-band, but their fingers don't glide across guitar strings, instead across keyboards. They call themselves KOO Tigers and besides a bit of fan love they want to win the world championships in League of Legends, a competitive computer game which millions of people world wide play.




Fans during the past week followed the path of the KOO Tigers and other teams closely. The best teams from all regions first played out the group phase, afterwards the quarter- and semi-finals took place in London and Brussels. The two best teams qualified for the final in Berlin, for *Worlds*, what the most important tourney in the League of Legends scene is also called. Tickets were sold out after two Minutes. The final is broadcasted in more than 20 languages for everyone who couldn't be there in the Mercedes-Benz-Arena.




But who actually are these people that spend money to watch other people play videogames? First impression: They are young people, but less young than you'd assume. There are many men, but the ratio of women is higher than expected. There are costumes, but it isn't Karnival and - despite the date- not Halloween either. There are four friends from Ukraine with gamer quotes like ""REKT"" on their shirts. The father with his two underage sons who, right before the opening, is chewing a Bockwurst and amusedly watches  a group of South Korean girls with green plush hats diligently taking selfies. Inside the hall spectacular videos on huge screens set the mood for the final while the hosts and commentators in fancy suits and colorful ties place their bets.




**A superstar named Faker**




None of the experts place their bets on KOO Tigers. The team is, to put it in classic sports terms, the Underdog. Just one year ago this team formed and the fact that they even made it into the worlds finals is already a small sensation. During the semifinals they beat European favorite Fnatic 3:0  and that they still aren't seen as favorites or sleeper tip is mostly due to their opponents SK Telecom, basically the FC Bayern of League of Legends.  Also from South Korea, SKT is currently seen as the strongest team in the world - 17:0 their record prior to the final. Two years ago they already won the tourney and now they could be the first team ever to repeat this achievement.




That SKT is this successful is partly due to Lee Sang-hyeok, better known as Faker. The wispy, quiet appearing 19 year old is the superstar of the scene. Girls adore him, other players admire his skill. When he , together with his team, stepped onto the stage in the middle of the arena the crowd greeted him with thunderous applause. The KOO Tigers, clothed in sneakers and grey hoodies, know: To get the WC they have to not only, but primarily, beat Faker.




On with it: hoodies off, headphones on, hands quickly warmed up and then it begins, the first of maximum five games. At the start of every match the *Draft* takes place: every player picks one character with special abilities, the champion. The choice of these five champions must be well coordinated with both the own role in your team and the picks of your enemy. Whoever miscalculates will have small chances for a win.  This win consists of destroying the enemy base and on your way there sending as many opposing champions into the afterlife as possible.




**The Underdog growls**




Sounds simple, but is tactically highly complex; a cat and mouse game lasting approximately 40 minutes which over its course often gets turned around. During the first minutes the KOO TIgers and their countrymen SKT get a feel for each other, the champions run, jump, virtually dance between the computer controlled minions back and forth waiting for the right moment. The moment comes after about five minutes: KOO Tigers manage to bring down a champion of SKT - ""First Blood"" it sounds through the arena and the first viewers cheer for the underdog.




The euphoria doesn't last long. Just a few minutes later SKT counters and turns the score to 4:2. Marin, the second star of SKT, sneaks up from behind and surprises the KOO Tigers. This ambush benefits especially Faker, who is suddenly almost undisturbed in his part of the map and accumulates ever more gold and experience points.  After about 40 minutes the base of KOO Tigers falls and while some fans still chant ""Faker, Faker"" both teams already left the stage. Expert agreement in the crowd: Like this there won't be a sensation.

We should listen to science and not emotion and fear. A country's history of tainted blood in the 80s should not affect its scientific decision making in the present. Especially given my main memory of the tainted blood scandal was Hep C. 

&gt; And those would be studies CBS will review. That said, to my knowledge Australia and NZ do not hav e a history of a tainted blood supply. CBS have unfortunately inherited a legacy from Red Cross.

NZ, EU and the American Red Cross have already reviewed and resoundingly endorsed/adopted it. 

&gt;People are worked up not about gay men donating blood but a statistically identified at-risk group donating blood.

Then why not ban the first nations from giving blood?

Bayer and Sanofi were unbelievably negligent in the tainted blood scandal. They didn't test plasma products at all, for anything. The tainted blood scandal didn't happen because gay people weren't banned from giving blood. 

&gt; I'm sorry if it rubs you wrong but CBS' mandate is towards the integrity of the blood supply and not peoples feelings.

And the science is clearly in favour of this shift.

Draw a perpendicular line through this path and you've got two other orientations, and a million degrees in between each.
Ancient and medieval people saw the horizon as a circle around them; they divided that circle into four quadrants; ""North"", ""South"", ""East"" and ""West"" came out what were thought to be the four principle winds based on the sun's path.  These four quadrants were then subdivided, in the case of the Greeks, in to 12 sub-winds.

lan60000,1,1,False,1446403532,team 74,"I never said Koreans don't have talented players, but the fact that they have better team synergy than NA teams because they understand how to work as a team. You really think Faker doesn't have bad days or poor games throughout his career in SKT? You really think KOO, KT, or even SSW from last year focused their strategies around a single individual to try and carry the team? If you haven't noticed, the only time that strategies worked around one person was probably at season 3 where SKT basically had Faker demolishing the other mid laners all the way till semi finals, but that plan only worked because the team was capable of making quick rotations which no other team has adapted to yet. Teams later on picked up on how to utilize a certain player's strengths more efficiency by focusing more on supporting the ""ace"" and creating quick objective taking strategies around that person. However, SSW and SSB basically changed the whole meta in season 4. The team didn't just revolve around IMP, but Mata orchestrated precise game strategies which created quick skirmishes, fast rotations, and solid objective controls which overwhelmed teams by force. SKT simply got outplayed as a team during season 4 simply because Faker was isolated and their strategy stagnated. Now it's season 5 and since the assassin meta stopped working, people perform these quick skirmishes and rotations through teleport play to be one step ahead of other teams, where individual plays rarely happen anymore. 

You speak as though NA is inevitably doomed to fail because our players are simply not as talented as Koreans, but NA has never had a solid team with the exception of C9, who took the NA LCS by storm at season 3 till now. None of their plays are focused on a certain individual, and you can arguably say that everyone on that team isn't exactly top 5 material. However, C9 understood how to play with one another better than any other NA teams so far, with the help of Hai's shot calling and mainly because they've played with each other for a long time. 

If you think consistently changing players is supposed to produce results, then you've obviously never played anything with a team before. Strategies, communication, synergy, and game play all differ from one member to the next; and you are consistently forced to adapt or accommodate a single player's quirks and habits whenever you swap someone out. To refresh a whole roster is basically saying your team has zero experience playing with one another, and you might as well consider yourselves a ""new"" team. Just because Fnatic and Origen managed to go far with their fresh line-up's doesn't mean the individual players were leagues ahead of others in order to win successfully. Fnatic is basically like the C9 of EU, where game plays all come from strategy and coordination more than individual performance. Huni making those solo kills look flashy, but Fnatic don't always try to support him at every turn. The times when Huni gets camped or plays poorly, the team still picks up his slack by outplaying the opposition elsewhere. NA teams have a terrible time recovering from a deficit, and the only way an NA LCS team normally recovers is to play even more passively while their map shrinks and hope for a miracle team fight to turn everything around. 

I don't know why you think people are spouting random nonsense when some of inven and reddit posts share pretty valuable insight.

&gt; You have 2 feet. You have a thumb. There are literally 2 borders; one to your north and one to your south. Hell, you could even travel further south and have even more options.

Hitchhiking can be dangerous for the driver and passenger, and with our more security oriented culture, greater access to transport and higher perceived danger level due to the media, it is definitely on the decline with fewer people offering and requesting it. Assuming you don't get murdered, run out of money/food and don't get lost or stranded on your way to your destination however, there is a whole new set of problems in finding employment.  
Not to mention the US is a vast country - often we Europeans have our remarks on Americans lacking a global perspective as they don't travel rebuked with arguments based on cost and the size of America. This would also work against any American looking to emigrate.  
And if an American should wish to go further afield to make something of themselves, then those costs will be even greater (and thumbing a lift wont be possible either). All of these factors conspire against any potential poor American emigrants.

&gt; But you don't.  

&gt;You know why? Because you acknowledge that moving somewhere with zero opportunity (assuming you actually put forth the effort to learn the language- which I know is probably too much to ask of you) would be a far shittier deal than working to better yourself in nation which affords you actual opportunity.

&gt;Anyone who truly wants to move, can move.

I don't have to time to go off and trawl all the employment statistics currently, but here is a summary. Mexico is not a great idea. More violent and less opportunity (why do you think there are so many Mexican immigrants in the states?), not to mention you would need to learn to understand a different language and culture. So that's pretty much a bust and you have a point.  
Canada is a different story. Higher taxes and such yes, but also a more comprehensive welfare system to get your back (once you've managed to integrate into their society properly). Currently lower employment (5.1% in the US vs 7.1% Canadian) however the difference is much less when both are adjusted to the american measurement system (5.1% US vs 6.0% Canada).  
So yes, currently you have better employment prospects in the states, overall. However Canada has a rapidly ageing population and faces a labour shortage before the end of the decade which will drastically improve job prospects - the same cannot be said for the US as immigration has helped somewhat stabilise the US population age (immigrants bring down the overall age of the population in general - controlled immigration is one avenue by which western nations can compensate for reduced birth rates and ageing populations). So Canadian employment has similar prospects nnow and much brighter prospects in the near future. Plus one for going to Canada.

&gt; That right there tells me just how privileged you are.  
Being later followed by  
&gt; Our nation has a shocking inequality of **motivation**, which **rightly** causes our ""inequalities of wealth"". The system works as intended.  
gave me a giggle.

it seems you are the privileged one. Yes, there are lazy people in society - these problems are even more apparent here in the UK with our vastly superior (in terms of what it offers to claimants) welfare system.  
Schooling quality is positively correlated with the wealth of the neighbourhood the school serves. Thus, the poorest in society are disadvantaged as they receive poorer education compared to those from more privileged backgrounds. On top of this employment is (unsurprisingly, if you think about it) also lower in the poor neighbourhoods.  
These factors stack up - kids can't get a decent education in the poor neighbourhoods and neither they nor their families can afford to pay for a better one - even getting part time work to help support themselves can be a task in and of itself. Which leaves them with one real option - move to a neighbourhood with better local schools. But that isn't an option either - why? Because *they're still poor!*  
These people get locked in a vicious cycle and only the lucky get out, often through winning scholarships to a good school and working their ass off at whatever it is they are there to do. The problem with this approach? Some people will never be good enough academically or at sport to achieve these scholarships, no matter how hard they try - so they get stuck and often give up eventually, as most people would. These people along with the naturally lazy slackers then give people like you the ammunition to make sweeping generalisations like you have and sweep the problem under the rug.

&gt; Your side always has such a penchant for drama.

What if I told you that I don't take sides because I think both sides often raise a plethora of points that are both valid and stupid; that polarised politics only serves to achieve slow or fuck all meaningful change and advancement?

&gt; So, finally, in 1913, the Private Central Bankers of Europe, in particular the Rothschilds of Great Britain and the Warburgs of Germany, met with their American financial collaborators on Jekyll Island, Georgia to form a new banking cartel with the express purpose of forming the Third Bank of the United States, with the aim of placing complete control of the United States money supply once again under the control of private bankers.


The meeting was actually in 1910. There were no Rothschilds or representatives of the Rothschilds there. Paul Warburg was invited because he was an expert on central banking, one of the most prominent advocates of central banking in America, and had presented his own plan for a central bank.[\[1\]](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9502E4DA153EE033A25755C0A9679C946697D6CF)[\[2\]](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C04E1DA1F3EE233A25752C0A9649C946997D6CF)[\[3\]](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9500E1DC1631E233A25752C1A9639C946997D6CF)[\[4\]](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9903E4D91430E233A25757C2A9659C946196D6CF)[\[5\]](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E03E2D8173BE430A75750C1A9679D946196D6CF)


The meeting on Jekyll Island was called by [Senator Nelson Aldrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_W._Aldrich), who was chairman of the [National Monetary Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Monetary_Commission). After two years of study —which produced [numerous volumes of research](http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/topics/?tid=13)— he asked for several bankers to assist him in drafting legislation to create a central banking system.

Aldrich was close to the Rockefellers. [His daughter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abby_Aldrich_Rockefeller) was married to [John D. Rockefeller, Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller,_Jr.)

Besides Aldrich, the others at the meeting were:

* [A. Piatt Andrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Piatt_Andrew), *Assistant Secretary of the Treasury*
* [Frank Vanderlip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_A._Vanderlip), *National City Bank*
* [Henry P. Davison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Pomeroy_Davison), *J P Morgan &amp; Co.*
* Charles D. Norton, *First National Bank of New York*
* [Benjamin Strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Strong,_Jr.), *Banker’s Trust of New York*
* [Paul Warburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Warburg), *Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.*

There are descriptions of the meeting in these two works:

* [Profile of Paul Warburg from *Men who are Making America* (1916)](http://books.google.com/books?id=vq8-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA398)
* [Chapter XXI in Frank Vanderlip's autobiography *From Farm Boy to Financier* (1935)](http://www.marketskeptics.com/2009/06/frank-vanderlip-and-creation-of-federal.html)

The plan produced at the meeting called for the creation of a National Reserve Association. Aldrich's bill never came up for a vote, but many elements of it were reused in the Democrat's Owen-Glass bill in 1913, which became the Federal Reserve Act.

Did anybody else notice this contradiction? Rivero says that the meeting has ""the aim of placing complete control of the United States money supply once again under the control of private bankers."" But the sentence just before that was ""Following Lincoln's assassination, the Greenbacks were pulled from circulation and **the American people forced to go back to an economy based on bank notes borrowed at interest from the private bankers.**"" So we already had currency from private bankers!


&gt; Owing to hostility over the previous banks, the name was changed to ""The Federal Reserve"" system in order to grant the new bank a quasi-governmental image, but in fact it is a privately owned bank, no more ""Federal"" than Federal Express. In fact, last year, the Federal Reserve successfully rebuffed a Freedom of Information lawsuit by Bloomberg News, on the ground that, as a private banking corporation, and not actually a part of the federal government, the Freedom of Information Act did not apply to operators of the Federal Reserve.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve is a [federal agency](http://www.federalreserve.gov/). The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks are legally separate from the federal government and have a mixture of private and public control, but they are nothing like any other private corporation. If you find out about the complicated [structure of the Federal Reserve system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System), you'll see how different it is.

Bloomberg News was [successful in their lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P._v._Board_of_Governors_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System), not the Federal Reserve.


&gt; 1913 proved to be a transformative year for the nation's economy, first with the passage of the 16th ""income tax"" Amendment and the false claim that it had been ratified.

[Don't try that argument with your own taxes!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Law_that_Never_Was#Legal_status_of_Benson.27s_claims)


&gt; Later that same year, and apparently unwilling to risk another questionable amendment, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act over Christmas holiday 1913, while members of Congress opposed to the measure were at home.

While it's true that almost 30 senators had already left town, an earlier version of the bill had passed the Senate a few days earlier [by a vote of 54 to 34](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E1D6103FE633A25753C2A9649D946296D6CF), a 20 vote margin. The final vote was 46 to 25, almost exactly the same margin. Five minutes of research on the web would have shown Rivero this wasn't true, but he doesn't care.

&gt; This was a very underhanded deal, as the Constitution explicitly vests Congress with the authority to issue the public currency, does not authorize its delegation, and thus should have required a new Amendment to transfer that authority to a private bank.

In an early draft of the Constitution, Congress was given the power to ""emit bills of credit""—that is, print paper currency—but that was [debated at the Constitutional Convention and the power was removed](http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/the-constitution-and-paper-money).

This left Congress with only the power to ""**coin** money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin.""

Did the federal government have the power to issue currency? The Supreme Court had declared the federal government's legal tender laws unconstitutional in 1870, but relented in 1871.

By contrast, the power of Congress to charter banks was never ruled unconstitutional and was [explicitly affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1819.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCulloch_v._Maryland)

Not only had the first Bank of the United States and the second Bank of the United States issued currency, so had all of the national banks created under Lincoln's national bank system.

    
&gt; But pass it Congress did, and President Woodrow Wilson signed it as he promised the bankers he would in exchange for generous campaign contributions. Wilson later regretted that decision.

&gt; ""I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is now controlled by its system of credit. We are no longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men."" -- Woodrow Wilson 1919

The first two sentences —  ""I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country."" — are not from Wilson. They were not attributed to Wilson until 30 years after his death. [Wilson was proud of the Federal Reserve until the day he died.](http://www.salon.com/2007/12/21/woodrow_wilson_federal_reserve/)

The rest of the quote come from two different campaign speeches ([\[1\]](http://books.google.com/books?id=MW8SAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22A+great+industrial+nation%22), [\[2\]](http://books.google.com/books?id=MW8SAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=%22no+longer+a+government%22)) in 1912, where he was promising to reform the monetary and banking system in the country, a promise he fulfilled with the creation of the Federal Reserve.

Zebidee,3,3,1446409167,1446405636,,"**Submitter's explanation:**

**The woman was Anna Walentynowicz, a worker at the Gdańsk Shipyard, in Poland from the 1950s to the 1980s.**

&gt; Anna began her quest for justice by speaking out publicly when one of her supervisors stole money from the workers' bonus fund to win a lottery.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead of reprimanding the corrupt supervisor, the system turned on her—she was harassed by secret police.
&gt; 
&gt; The 'exemplary worker' and 'Hero of Socialist Labor' had become a vocal dissident, because the so-called workers state did not care about its workers.
&gt; 
&gt; Walentynowicz joined the newly formed WZZ or Free Trade Unions of the Coast in 1978, and in the early 1980s [along with others] came to symbolize the opposition movement.
&gt; 
&gt; For participation in the illegal trade union she was fired from work on 7 August 1980, 5 months prior to her plan to retire.
&gt; 
&gt; This management decision enraged the workers, who staged a strike action on 14 August, defending Anna Walentynowicz, and demanding her return.

[Edited from the Wikipedia article on Anna Walentynowicz.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Walentynowicz)

**Economic problems in Poland in the 1970s had led to worker's strikes, and pressure for independent trade unions, which were illegal in Soviet influenced Communist Poland. Ultimately, these strikes and pressures led to the start of the Solidarity trade union, which was legitimised after the strike started by Anna Walentynowicz's dismissal.**

&gt; The labor strikes did not just occur because of problems that emerged shortly before the unrest, but due to the difficulties of the government and the economy for over ten years. Under the rule of Władysław Gomułka in the late 1960s, Poland’s economy was in disarray. To counter this, the government increased food prices just before Christmas in 1970 which irritated the entire populace of the nation. On December 14, 1970 workers from the Lenin shipyard in Gdańsk began a strike against party headquarters within the city insisting on the formation of independent trade unions.
&gt; 
&gt; Fuelled by large infusions of Western credit, Poland's economic growth rate was one of the world's highest during the first half of the 1970s, but much of the borrowed capital was misspent and the centrally planned economy was unable to use the new resources effectively. The growing debt burden became insupportable in the late 1970s and economic growth had become negative by 1979.
&gt; 
&gt; As the economy became unbearable, the Communist government authorized the increase in food prices for the summer of 1980. Once again a revival of labor disturbances erupted throughout the nation. Workers of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk ultimately went on strike in mid-August, sparked by the firing of Anna Walentynowicz. 
&gt;
&gt;Led by electrician Lech Wałęsa, the workers took control of the shipyard and demanded labor reform and greater civil rights including the freedom of expression and religion, and the release of political prisoners. On the third day of the strike, on August 16, 1980, management granted Lenin Shipyard workers their working and pay demands. Lech Wałęsa and others announced the end of the strike, however the women of the shipyard, Anna Waletynowicz and Alina Pienkowska transformed a strike over bread and butter issues into a solidarity strike in sympathy with other striking establishments.

**These actions led to the Gdańsk Agreement, which legitimised the Solidarity trade union on August 31, 1980**

[Edited from the Wikipedia article on the Gdańsk Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk_Agreement)

**Solidarity's pressure on the Communist Polish government eventually led to semi-free elections in 1989, in which the government was overthrown, and Solidarity's leader, Lech Wałęsa was elected president.**

&gt; The history of Solidarity, a Polish non-governmental trade union, began on 14 August 1980, at the Lenin Shipyards (now Gdańsk Shipyards) at its founding by Lech Wałęsa and others. In the early 1980s, it became the first independent labor union in a Soviet-bloc country. Solidarity gave rise to a broad, non-violent, anti-communist social movement that, at its height, claimed some 9.4 million members. It is considered to have contributed greatly to the fall of communism.
&gt; 
&gt; Poland's communist government attempted to destroy the union by instituting martial law in 1981, followed by several years of political repression, but in the end was forced into negotiation. The Roundtable Talks between the government and the Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections in 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wałęsa was elected president. This was soon followed by the dismantling of the communist governmental system and by Poland's transformation into a modern democratic state. 
&gt;

[Edited from the Wikipedia article on the history of Solidarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Solidarity)

**Solidarity's example led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout the Eastern Bloc, weakening communist governments. This process later culminated in the Revolutions of 1989.**

&gt; The Revolutions of 1989 were part of a revolutionary wave that resulted in the Fall of Communism in the Communist states of Central and Eastern Europe and beyond. 
&gt; 
&gt; The events began in Poland in 1989, and continued in Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Romania.
&gt; 
&gt; Hungary physically dismantled its section of the Iron Curtain leading to a mass exodus of East Germans through Hungary and destabilizing East Germany. This would lead to mass demonstrations in cities such as Leipzig and subsequently to the fall of the Berlin Wall, which served as the symbolic gateway to German reunification in 1990.
&gt; 
&gt; The Soviet Union was dissolved by the end of 1991, resulting in 14 countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan) declaring their independence from the Soviet Union in the course of the years 1990–91 and the bulk of the country being succeeded by Russia in December 1991.
&gt; 
&gt; Communism was abandoned in Albania and Yugoslavia between 1990 and 1992, the latter country having split into five successor states by 1992: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Slovenia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later renamed Serbia and Montenegro, and later still split into two states, Serbia and Montenegro). Serbia was then further split with the breakaway of the partially recognized state of Kosovo. Czechoslovakia too was dissolved three years after the end of communist rule, splitting peacefully into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1992. The impact was felt in dozens of Socialist countries. Communism was abandoned in countries such as Cambodia, Ethiopia, Mongolia, and South Yemen. The collapse of Communism (and of the Soviet Union) led commentators to declare the end of the Cold War.
&gt; 
&gt; In the years immediately following 1989, the fall of Apartheid system, the end of Chilean Military Dictatorship, the democratization of Ghana and Suriname, the fall of communist party in Italy and San Marino, and the renewal of the Italian political class were recorded.
&gt; 
&gt; Many Communist and Socialist organisations in the West turned their guiding principles over to social democracy. The European political landscape was drastically changed, with numerous Eastern Bloc countries joining NATO and stronger European economic and social integration entailed.

And they put signs up for it. And they LAUGH with people. My second day living in Amsterdam I was walking around the city checking things out and I saw a young woman Dutch policewoman, full gear with the glock standing on the corner with someones baby on her hip giving it the hip bound and goo goo gahh gahh and talking to the mother.  

Wait a fucking minute?!!! There is a cop, playing with babies, smiling, laughing, warning me not to buy the cocaine because theres a bad batch going around town, and directing traffic.  

Do you think she was worried about someone pulling a gun on her and shooting her? No. Do you think she was worried about having to arrest some dude like me for buying cocaine or weed and me running or fucking her up or more likely and heart wrenching, her having fuck me up? In front of said family with happy babies? No.  

If this had been any number of places Ive lived in the U.S. such as Brooklyn, Dallas, Los Angeles the fucking cop wouldn't be caught dead standing on a street corner laughing and giggling and playing with babies if it was a neighborhood you could buy drugs in. Dude would be in the cruiser, with a partner, watching his back.  

The point is that police, like all people, organizations, etc. are products of their environment. The police in Holland don't care if you get out of your car because the police in Holland don't get sprayed with the automatics or the shotgun when they pull someone over. I promise if you took American crime and put it in northern europe, particularly the Scandinavian countries those cops would start acting the same way. Likewise I imagine even the hardest most racist beat cop from LA or Brooklyn would enjoy a day on the beat playing with babies, looking at hookers in the window and warning people about a bad batch of cocaine vs. having to beat someone half to death for buying it.

&gt;Where are you economically and why?

I am a Corporatist. I'm sure you are familiar with it, but for clarification: Corporatism takes the best parts of Socialism, such as providing basic needs, and the best parts of Capitalism, such as self-determination, and uses it to advance the interests of the nation. It advocates a Guild system(hence '*Corporat*ism), whereby the Guild controls relevant aspects of government. For example, the Fisherman's guild would control the wages of Fisherman, depending on their rank, and it would be their responsibility to make the working conditions sufficient, and so on. The only people eligible to join a guild would be Fisherman, so the Guild would be governed by people who understand the aspects of the life of a Fisherman would make the decisions. There would obviously me votes on some aspects. The government would only intervene when necessary, and the Guild would not be able to make laws that would effect the nation as a whole. This economic policy is controversial, as it was used in Fascist Italy. I know next to nothing about economics, however, so I should not really be entitled to make a decision when it comes to economics.

&gt; CAIRO - A Russian plane that crashed in Egypt over the weekend broke up in midair, a senior Russian aviation official said after visiting the crash site in the Sinai Peninsula on Sunday.

&gt; Germany&amp;#039;s Transportation Ministry urged the country&amp;#039;s airlines not to use the route the Russian plane used when it crashed in Sinai, according to the Associated Press.

&gt; The charter flight operated by the Russian carrier Metrojet &amp;quot;Disappeared&amp;quot; shortly after takeoff from Sharm al-Sheikh, a popular destination for Russian tourists, Russia&amp;#039;s Federal Air Transport Agency said.

Rogue pathologists harvest from cadavers without prior consent to further their research.. and ten years after the practice is discovered by peers and stopped, a Swedish newspaper tries to politicize it. Liberal Europeans are shocked that Israelis are killing innocent Palestinians solely to drink their blood, Israelis are shocked when they recognize portentous, generations-old libels. The United Nations gets involved and it's SNAFU.

According to Jewish law, bodies must be buried intact. Bodies should be buried soon after death and without cremation, embalming, or preservation of any kind. Strict interpretations of the law might prohibit autopsies. 

Israel has a thriving medical practice and research industry, and is pioneering techniques for transplantation, but ingrained cultural and religious ideas mean that organ donation has been rare. Recent campaigns to raise public awareness and ideas about helping others by donation have increased the number of registered donors, and motorcyclists have increased the donation pool of viable tissue and organs. 

Here's a bit of added morbid reality: According to the same Jewish laws, if a body is destroyed at the time of death it should be buried as intact as is possible at that time. If a body is badly destroyed, this is difficult. If bodies are destroyed by a bomb in Israel, then religious Jews will arrive to collect the pieces of bodies, and sort them into individuals as best they can. This goes right down to combing buses or marketplaces with tweezers and plastic bags. They consider this careful collection of pieces a religious obligation of the community to allow the deceased to be properly buried.",MorbidReality,0,t3_3r3xz3,,1449534132,0,,t1_cwkpmcb,t5_2tz1e,cwkrrho,

I said as of 2015 to be clear that I'm talking about how things are *now*, but this has been true since around 2013 (on some ISPs from 2012 or 2011).

You are coming into a conversation with 6 year outdated info (your experience was 2009) as if that matters in the slightest. I guarantee you you'd have a worse experience had you been in the US in 2009.

Maybe you should yourself, rather than getting your information from reddit headlines.

The EU ruled that data for essential services like public hospitals could be prioritised. It is already illegal for ISPs to be *paid* to prioritise data (or to prioritise their own commercial data) **and will remain so**.

Although my country is in the EU and is getting more and more progressive, there are some leftover traits from the USSR times.

Alcoholism/alcohol consumption culture. Everybody is pressured in to drinking and if you say else-wise - you don't respect everybody else.

Back in the day it was either conscription or higher education. Even after the retraction of conscription, the parents of young adults considered them useless without ""an education"", so nowadays there are very few highschool graduates that didn't attempt to get into university, hence the lack of manual laborers.

Cursing using Slavic words is commonplace.

Some regions that had a lot of Russian citizens from job relocations refuse to speak the local language to this day.

Some of the holidays that were held in the USSR days are still unofficially celebrated and some traditions are still popular.

Shitty, old Ladas in the streets.

And probably the most notable - Racism. Back in the USSR, using blackface in 1960's movies was totally cool. Apart from the central Asian population, most people hadn't seen a non-white person with their own eyes. Most of their knowledge was limited. Even to this day young people still drop racial slurs like casual words, without hesitation. This is a trend in decline (at least in public), but you can still hear young, educated adults referring to black people as if they were primates, mocking them for no other reason than their looks.

Also, back in the day, shops were empty. Deficits of anything that was worth having. So anything that was any good was obtained through acquaintances. Jobs, inside-info on stock-ups, you name it. People that had access to anything good from factories, stores and such would hoard everything and resell to their friends. Even to this day it's hard to get a job here without having some one on the inside sticking their head out for you. I have an acquaintance that's an employee at a major retail chain in our country. She gets me and my girlfriend items that are on sale but don't even make it to the shelves because all of the employees. And all of the elderly still go to the stores 1 hour before opening like it's 1969. They shove and curse like there's no tomorrow and that pack of macaroni is the last in the universe.

And the worst thing - when we separated from the Soviet Union, we had more than 50 years of culture to consume in very little time. So the 90's-early 2000's were a cringe-fest of all western pop-culture mashed into one, ugly piece of shit. All of these talk shows discussing how awful these new things are.

Also, if you're over 50 - chances are you still feel nostalgia for the USSR and think that the old ways were the best. GOD DAMN YOUTHS AND THEIR COCA-COLAS. ",AskReddit,0,t3_3r3zs7,,1449534833,0,,t3_3r3zs7,t5_2qh1i,cwkt90a,

I've sold 2 mounts myself the last month and know for a fact there are mounts circulating on outland, ragnaros and kazzak which are a few of the bigger EU servers. But they also operate on smaller servers like some german ones etc.

When the supplier has items this tends to be very little instead of a large stock, the supplier I know makes around 30 mounts a week and sell them across different servers (where he needs gold).

British farmers currently receive 60pc of their income from EU subsidies and environmental subsidies. They would lose most of this at a stroke unless the British government guaranteed compensating support of one kind or another, and so far it has clarified nothing.

[So *this* report then...](http://imgur.com/hyONGRX)

I mean, ffs, it's being  ordered ""on the direction of the president"" and assumes the UK wouldn't replace CAP subsidies with anything - which nobody is arguing for - ignoring that the UK currently pays £2 in the CAP budget for every £1 it receives.

Total fear-mongering that can be linked back to the Commission itself.

You can't just say David Cameron's government hasn't clarified his position on replacement agriculture subsidies on an exit and therefore we're going to assume all subsidies won't be replaced with anything at all - and then portray a doomsday scenario.

http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-economic-inequality/#fixing-the-tax-code-for-citizens-corporations-and-banks

&gt; Wow you've drunken the cool aid. It's not a tax on speculation.

The insult adds nothing.

Actually, Bernie's college plan is entirely paid for by a Robin Hood tax on Wall Street:

[This legislation is offset by imposing a Wall Street speculation fee on investment houses, hedge funds, and other speculators of 0.5% on stock trades (50 cents for every $100 worth of stock), a 0.1% fee on bonds, and a 0.005% fee on derivatives. It has been estimated that this provision could raise hundreds of billions a year which could be used not only to make tuition free at public colleges and universities in this country, it could also be used to create millions of jobs and rebuild the middle class of this country.](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/collegeforallsummary/?inline=file)

None of Bernie's policies include more taxes for the middle class.  Only for the 1% and corporations that are using tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.

&gt;  So unless you are going to claim that the middle class is not invested in the stock market then it is very much a tax on them.

The upper middle class is invested in the stock market.  Bernie Sanders is more concerned with these facts:

- [The top one-tenth of 1 percent today in America owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/SaezZucman2014.pdf)  

- [58 percent of all new income generated is going to the top 1 percent.](http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/fact-check/2015/07/27/bernie-sanders-weath-income-inequality-fact-check/30633061/)

- [22% of children live in poverty](http://www.nccp.org/topics/childpoverty.html)

- [The wealthiest **15** people in this country saw their wealth increase by $170 billion dollars in the past two years.  They acquired more wealth in a two year period than is owned by the bottom 130 million Americans.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2015/03/02/forbes-billionaires-full-list-of-the-500-richest-people-in-the-world-2015/)

You can look through Bernie's stances on the issues here:

Because islam is incompatible with a free and tolerant world that holds basic human rights and diversity in ideas and people in the highest regard. In its current form practiced by muslims worldwide.

&gt;And America believe and act in the way it wants?

We do. And I wish to have a world where the level of tolerance and diversity is at least as good as it is in America. Its fucking great here. I want that for the whole world. Its not great in the islamic world. Do those people, those women, seem happy to you? Do you feel they have their basic human rights respected?

&gt;If you're crying about Muslims coming to your country and changing your way of life, then you are indeed hypocritical that at the same time you want to come over to their country and change their way of life.

Muslims arwnt changing my way of life but I see no priblem forcing the most barbaric culture in the world to get with the times and give that stupid, malicious and utterly insane ideology a swift kick in the ass on its way out. 

Do you live in LaLa land? Are you aware of the problems currently plaguing not only the middle east but also Europe and most of Asia? Guess what is at the center of all of them? **ISLAM.**

&gt;Not only that, but you want to do it violently and forcibly through war.

If there was a diplomatic solution, it would have been had by now. Its time we stop believing this can all go away through some talks over a cup of coffee. *Clearly it is not.* When they stop bombing their own people, and ours, and raping boys and treating women and LBGTQ people as subhuman and tolerate protests without violence and respect the beliefs of others then maybe we can get along. Sadly Mohammed never said to tolerate other beliefs and explicitly said in his oh so perfect wisdom that women are second class possessions to be ""harvested"" by men. 

&gt;At the very least, you are just as bad as the Muslims you despise.

I dont despise muslims. I despise islam. Big difference. People can change but that ideology has demonstrated for about 1400 years now that it wont change. 

Now, please tell me how the care bears would address the worldwide Islamic derived violence plaguing the globe? How would the care bears change the opinions of the &gt;70% of muslims outside Europe that believe a woman should obey her husband?",news,0,t3_3r2jx0,,1449537000,0,,t1_cwkx9du,t5_2qh3l,cwkxum9,

He definitely has some good proposals, and I have to say I agree with him on up to 60% of things. Ending privatized prisons, the drug war, more restrained foreign policy. 

But his overall vision is to turn America into the European socialist model. Young and left leaning people idolize Europe, but its entire social model has serious long-term flaws and the modern Europe is hardly a model to follow, especially in the diverse-in-many-ways America. 

Also, eagerly giving citizenship to millions of people who came here illegally sets a bad precedent and a negative incentives, and reeks of pursuing political shift through demographic shift.

Astamir,6,6,False,1446422250,,"Edit : It turns out that this post is gonna be absurdly long. Sorry about the rant, I tried to address a bit too many things at once but it's written now so whatever.

Alright, this thread is an absolute trainwreck. As a social scientist there's a lot I'd like to say to everyone in here but I'll focus on OP's actual questions first:

1- Enjoyment of travel : Expressing complete and absolute delight over travel is typical; most people don't enjoy themselves as much as they say during oversea vacations but they do focus on remembering the good things. When you look at others showing off their crazy travel experiences, do keep in mind that it's often embellished ""for the camera"". 

2- Personal growth and travel : Most people who travel don't gain anything, personality-wise, from it. This is something that needs to change but the western approach to tourism is super messed up, partly because cultural imperialism is still very much a part of us even if we don't realize it. Because of this, the average tourist that goes to Western Europe or South East Asia will come back with nothing more than nice pictures and bragging rights. For most people, traveling is a lot less transformative than they'd like to tell you. I had the chance to visit South Korea with other social scientists and it was a horrible experience; people who would otherwise be perceived as experts in some aspects of human society behaved like absolute dipshits and learned literally nothing from the culture they visited. Now imagine someone who doesn't even think about cultural exchanges. Why am I mentioning this? Because you can be a very wise and interesting person without having ever traveled, as long as you focus on learning new things from cultures you don't know much about. Documentaries are great for that, even if you can't brag about visiting places.

3- Inequality of opportunity : The world is extremely unfair. As an individual you need to try to focus on the positive sides of your own life experiences while attempting to leverage them to increase your resilience to difficult times. You also need to learn that if you're suffering from inequality right now, there's very little chance that life will offer you some kind of karmic reward later in life. There's no god, there's no dharma, there's only you getting accustomed to a lot more garbage than some of your peers, and perhaps becoming stronger for it. But perhaps not. This means that you **need** to put yourself as a priority. I know your parents aren't doing well but they've lived for 60 years now. They can manage 2 weeks without you. And if they can't then at some point you need to detach yourself from them. Living in a weird feudal relationship with your parents is gonna leave you unhappy and broken. If you can save a bit of that surplus you're making and throwing into your student debts and future house, say 5% of the total surplus, and put it in a ""travel plan"" thing, I strongly urge you to do it. At some point it becomes harder to travel and it would be a waste to wait until you're 40 before doing it. It's still ok, but it's not great. 

4- Investment priorities : Buying a house, especially if you're coming out of a lower socioeconomic bracket, is an **exceedingly risky** investment. I cannot stress that enough, and my specialization is regional economics so I know a lot about this kind of stuff. Seriously, before you sacrifice your mental and physical health working only on your debt/capital ratio and taking care of others, you need to spend at least a bit of money on yourself. Not a house. Take an overseas breather, it's a much better investment than a house right now, and it's a lot less risky. Some people try to buy a house as fast as they can in the hope that it'll be their ticket to less stress and a better life, and it turns out being much more complicated than expected. If you're making enough money to accumulate a surplus with which you could buy a house, you're making enough money to travel. Seriously. Just travel first and relax your expectations concerning house-buying. Otherwise that resentment you've been living with will only grow deeper. You deserve some kind of reward for your hard work. Everyone does. Don't wait too long before grabbing it.


On a more personal note, OP, I can totally relate because I grew up extremely poor and couldn't travel until much later than everyone I know. While you wait, I really think you should consider checking out all the interesting documentaries you can find on youtube, as well as reading up on Anthropology. There's a ton of interesting research being done in social sciences that, I think, can help us be a bit less frustrated about our current situation in life. 

Hope that helps in some way.",travel,0,t3_3r3u42,,1450436295,0,,t3_3r3u42,t5_2qh41,cwkzf07,False

&gt; ANKARA, Turkey - Turkey&amp;#039;s Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has declared victory for his ruling party after preliminary election results showed it restoring its majority in parliament.

&gt; Most analysts had expected AKP to fall short again, but the preliminary results suggest it picked up millions of votes at the expense of the nationalist MHP and pro-Kurdish People&amp;#039;s Democratic Party, or HDP. AKP&amp;#039;s vote tally jumped nearly nine percentage points.

&gt; Erdogan has lashed out at the party, calling it the political arm of the Kurdistan Workers Party, which Turkey and most Western countries consider a terrorist organization.

http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php

This is technically just refugees coming by sea into europe, so its admittedly just a snapshot of the entire refugee crisis. either way, every article i found on this topic seemed to use this same exact source. but when i tried to find the specific pdf that data came from, i couldn't find the *actual* source. do you know which document it is? i'd love to see the actual methodology. 

what is interesting is that the second best gender source i could find was this:

http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php

this is slightly different though. This data is on only syrian refugees, and it only has data for refugees going into egypt, iraq, jordan and lebanon. What is really interesting is that this gender breakdown is almost exactly 50/50. Assuming both of these sources are correct, that means men and women are equally likely to leave syria and go into neighboring middle eastern countries- however, a huge group of women must stop there and settle in those countries, while the ones continuing on into europe are mostly men. I have *no* idea why this is the case but i wish there was more information on this. it seems like a very odd demographic disparity. there has to be some cause for the numbers to be that different.

As for whether there should be a major in America, there are a lot of reasons not to until a big CS event has proven itself to be popular. DH Austin has great potential, was IEM San Jose brilliantly popular? I can't remember.

The reason the major was in Romania is that DH Bucharest is always huge and Valve assumed that it'd be equally popular in Cluj. This wasn't the case.

What Europe and Scandinavia do would be more accurately called a ""social market democracy"".

However, once its existence is provided for, a market also won't just inherently, and magically, always serve just socially useful goals.

Standard professional rules do not apply if you can walk up and see one of your employees wide awake and in a common area. It is not like double is known for a good sleep schedule.

Because they felt that a sudden inclusion of an ADC sub would give stress to double at worlds. They also were already bringing Huni as their only mid series sub under riot rules.

**Castle of Illusion, Land of Illusion, Choplifter, Aztec Adventure, Alien Syndrome, Fantasy Zone, Jurassic Park, Sonic the Hedgehog** (different than the Genesis game!), and **Zillion** are all stand-out titles.

The Sega Master System is in many ways more powerful than the Nintendo Entertainment System and was more popular than the NES in large parts of Europe and Latin America. Unfortunately (and for a variety of reasons) the Master System never saw the kind of developer support that the NES did, so there are a lot fewer ""classic"" titles on Sega's 8-bit console than on Nintendo's. 

That doesn't mean it isn't worth playing! While the NES certainly has *more* classic games, the Sega Master System has it's own classics and doesn't receive nearly as much attention as it deserves.

*************************

I know you said you like the SNES but don't forget to give the **NES** some love. There are just as many great games on the NES as the SNES. Many people (myself included) would argue that there are *more* great games on the NES than on the SNES. It's a matter of taste. There are so many great NES games in almost every genre that it's hard to tell you where to start when I don't know what kind of games you like. There are hundreds of good lists online that talk about the best games for the system. **Super Mario Bros 3**, **Contra**, **Kirby's Adventure**, **Mega Man 2**, or **Castlevania** (either the original or the third one) are all classics.

*******************

In the same vein, I know you said you have a GBA, but all three generations of **Game Boy** have tons of great games available. Again, there are so many that you should just look online for some ""best of"" lists and pick games that speak to you. 

Some popular choices:

On the **original Game Boy...**

**Super Mario Land 2** and **3, Kirby's Adventure** (and the sequel), the **Pokemon** games (especially **Yellow** if you like the anime) and most of the **Mega Man** games are all great. 

On the **Game Boy Color...** 

**Super Mario Bros Deluxe** (an enhanced remake of the original NES game), **Wario Land 3, Pokemon Gold** or **Silver** (or **Crystal** if you want a slightly different story with the same gameplay) and of course all three **Zelda** games are terrific, but **The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX** is my favorite.

On the **Game Boy Advance...** 

There are too many. **Drill Dozer** and **The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap** don't get enough love, and both **Metroid** games are masterpieces. The system is also full of great remakes of classics like the **NES** and **SNES Mario games**, **The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past**, and others. And there's a ton of RPGs like **Golden Sun** and **Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga**... just dive in. There are dozens of classics on this system, at least as many as you'll find on the SNES.

&gt; No sir, the anger and resentment was caused by British occupation, which was preceded by broken promises for an independent Arab state that had been made under the  [Hussein–McMahon Correspondence of 1915–1916](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein%E2%80%93McMahon_Correspondence), and that were later trashed by the British with the superseding [Sykes Picot Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#Conflicting_promises), which favored Zionist aspirations over those of the Palestinian Arabs.

&gt; The Arabs were well aware of the [Balfour Declaration](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/balfour.html), and knew very well that the British had been appointed under the [British Mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine_%28legal_instrument%29) so that they could facilitate the mass immigration of European Jews who had been flooding into Palestine since 1933.

For example, a LOT of Muslims (something like 70%+ in Europe) believed that the Hebdo killings were justified. Are you fucking kidding me?

Not sure why you disagree here.  Of course people are fleeing from ISIS...ISIS faces massive security challenges.  They flee to places that don't have security challenges, where they can sleep without fear of getting raped or killed.  Places like Europe, i.e. the current refugee crisis.

&gt;You believe that they are totalitarian because of the USA's CIA? We disagree.

[edit: To be clear here, I'm ONLY using the CIA in the context of HUMINT.  You're lumping all the CIA's operations together and saying that the CIA can exploit disillusioned ISIS soldiers to form a terrorist/paramilitary unit that could topple ISIS.  I agree that's a possible tactic the CIA may employ, but that's not relevant to my HUMINT argument.]

&gt;Does the CIA have massive HUMINT inflows from within ISIS? First the CIA recruits the sex slaves that want to go home.

This doesn't make sense.  ISIS with their exceptionally tight population controls would surely know who fled and who returned, and would probably behead immediately anyone who fled.

&gt;Then the CIA recruits their fighters.

That's not really HUMINT as much as it is a form of terrorism, assuming that ISIS is a nation-state.

&gt;Imagine if the US was beheading and burning children. You are suggesting that many US troops would be silent and that few would attempt to flee?

They would not be welcomed back to the US, unless they had a death wish.

&gt;So, would you suggest that your thoughts on this are ""neutral""? 

""Neutral"" to my knowledge of how this sub works means ""substantiated with evidence"".  So, feel free to ask for any evidence for my claims.  I've made a lot of claims, so to back them up would probably take several times the amount of time of me typing this out.  A lot of it is historical, so I didn't want to spend too much time backing those up unless there was an actual disagreement with non-recent history.

Also, a lot of this ISIS stuff is going to be supposition of classified information from both of us, so supporting those claims is going to be very difficult.  We can only rely upon our reasoning for those claims.

Nem eu acho que tenha a ver com ideologia nem com guerra entre gêneros. Agora, que tem a ver com a sociedade, isso tem, porque se fosse algo inerente à condição humana, aí teríamos os mesmos índices de estupro em todos os países do mundo. Porém, como em alguns países há mais estupros do que em outros, só podemos concluir que é a sociedade mesmo. 

&gt; Meu ponto é que não existe motivo algum pra ligar machismo com estupro.

Mas é claro que existe... vou dar um exemplo de ligação. Tem outros, mas vamos com esse aqui. Vou fazer umas proposições e presumo que você irá concordar com a maioria delas.

 - A certeza da impunidade dá ensejo a muitos crimes, inclusive estupros. Você concorda? Presumo que sim.

 - A impunidade ocorre, muitas vezes, porque a vítima não faz a denúncia. Você concorda? Presumo que sim.

 - Vítimas de estupro muitas vezes não denunciam o estuprador porque têm medo da repercussão. Têm medo de serem chamadas de putas, de serem questionadas se provocaram a situação, de ficarem mal-faladas. Você concorda? Também presumo que sim.

 - Culpabilizar a vítima, dizer que ela quem provocou, que ""estava querendo"" são frutos do machismo. Ou seja, a proposição acima só é verdade porque a sociedade é machista. Se não fosse, mulheres teriam menos medo de denunciar, mais estupradores seriam pegos, e por isso haveria menos estupros. Esse é o cerne da questão.

Se mesmo assim você discorda que o machismo tem ligação com estupros, então gostaria que refutasse.

&gt; Da mesma forma que não tem motivo algum fazer uma conexão entre bandidos e pobreza. Pobreza não forma caráter, a família forma, uma boa mãe/pai/tio/avô/avó/tutor, ou mesmo uma bondade inerente ao ser humano, a empatia que todos nós carregamos (exceto os psicopotas), isso forma um bom cidadão.

What I can say is that there are two primary motivators for the current influx of migrants. First there are some who are fleeing violence and destruction.

Does this constitute a quest for freedom? Not exactly.

Perhaps my suspicions don't belong in NP, but I think the context, i.e., the cold war, at least raises questions.

And you actually have more and more countries being created from previous one (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Number_of_countries.png, x3-4 since ~1950), these facts completely contradicts your assumptions. But yes, sometimes we are trying to pull those countries to make some new kind of empire, as the EU tries to do.

Empire is something of the past, where people are being conquered by force. Nation state are more like a wish to live together that triggers those new nations creation.

With our current ""democracy"" where we elect people that will run our lives, I'm very wary of making ever bigger countries/empires under one power. I don't want this, the more I'm close to political the better. We should make thing more and more local, more and more peer2peer, this is the current trend of the technology and what some people are making.

I think we are currently witnessing the opposite, not only are nations emerging but we are witnessing right now the collapse of the EU for example, an artificial law-made creation, where we tried to artificially bounds nations under the same economical and political rules even though those nation may have very few in common (cultural and geographical, even though I dont want France amazing social institution to be overriden, I want to improve it, I guess it is currently being threaten). This is also in some way a racist construction, France for example, share more culture with north african people (colonization and immigration, you just have to walk in the street...) than with, lets say bulgarian. So, the EU, is just some kind of arbitrary and ideological construction. 

And it's failing its adverstised goal which is to avoid war, on the contrary the greek have developed a deep hatred toward germany, walls are being built right now all other Europe. You actually don't need those things, Eramus is not an EU thing, THC is not either, AirBus either. You don't need the EU to make people come together, on the contrary.

But you are true about one thing though, nation state has already been destroyed, but by capitalist. Capital goes where he see fits without control from the citizen. 
Now we are just trying to pull the people themselves out of their nation in a massive free market, the neoliberal ideology at work. This is the current empire that is being built and I will fight it, this is a massive threat for democracy.

&gt;* The draft aviation policy, released last week, proposes to allow unlimited civilian flights - on a reciprocal basis - from countries that are more than 5,000 km, or seven hours' of flying time away.

&gt;* However, the lack of clarity on the rule that bars new domestic airlines from flying abroad will prevent players such as Vistara and AirAsia from taking advantage of the change in policy.

&gt;* AirAsia India CEO Mittu Chandilya said the removal of the rule ""would have unbridled the entire sector and shown optimism not only to current incumbents but also to potential future investors"".

&gt;* According to Kapil Kaul of global aviation consultancy CAPA, a policy that promotes open access for foreign airlines and is closed for Indian carriers is not realistic.

&gt;* A large part of the traffic to the UAE is being flown to Europe and North America, carrying away potential revenues of Indian carriers and airports.

Regardless I can't count the number of times I've seen American this or American that and it have nothing to do with actual American companies. Most technology out of Japan comes from elsewhere but is improved in Japan, like cars, TVs, toilets, etc. German nor Japanese tech helped them much in WW2. South Korea can in many ways thank the US for their recent economy boom (and their freedom from communism) along with the Vietnamese. (Communism would have obstructed a market economy.) America = brand value and business owners in third world countries want to reap that for all it's worth. If you look at product development trends in South Korea and Japan you'll notice somewhat of a creativity gap and lack of true innovation. Even video games and anime borrow themes from Norse mythology and old Japanese tales. This can be attributed to collectivist societies where individual thought and self expression is suppressed from an early age, unlike an individualist society like in America. East Asian countries with developed economies (Japan &amp; South Korea) are really good at taking ideas and improving on them (like better LCD panels in TVs or heated toilet seats that open and close by themselves). They didn't invent computers or discover airplanes. Germany is known for advanced manufacturing processes and modern machinery. Still the list of inventions/contributions to the world of the countries you mentioned would be dwarfed by that of the United States. People deny it all the time because of their own national pride, but the evidence is quite clear. Melting pot of cultures/ideas + freedom+ capitalism/free market economy leads to product and process innovations.

Edit: You realize the development of South Korea's and Japan's economy is directly related to their interactions with the West and most importantly the United States right?

AmeliaVampireAMA,1,1,False,1446440957,,"Ooh!.. Good questions.  I'm afraid this might be another novel.  My apologies in advance.

&gt; What would you say was the scariest time period you lived?

I'm not entirely sure I can pick, but there are a few that stand out.  

1.  The time surrounding my change, around 1810.  Imagine being required to physically hurt and take from your own species-- your family, your friends, *complete strangers*.  You need what's *inside* them to survive.  Now imagine you're what I was: just under twenty years old, stuck in the north of rural France during the start of what ended up being luckily a rather mild winter, with no neighbours immediately nearby.  

Who would you feed from?  How would you *find* people to feed from?  It was a steep learning curve.  There's a whole story there I'll write, if you'd like.

2.  The few decades during the two Great Wars, especially the second.  I was actually in Germany right before it began its decline into war for the second time.  Lucky me, I had already planned to spend some time in the UK and Ireland.  The entirety of Europe -- the world, really -- was affected by the conflict, but I will always count my blessings that I left Germany when I did.  It is a *beautiful* country with some of the kindest people I've ever met, but it went through a terrible period.

3.  Today is probably the most terrifying.  We've always been numbers on a piece of paper in some government office, even before I was born.  Now we're bits of data on a server that can be accessed anywhere in the world.  When you cross a country's border, they reference that.  If it's not all in order, boy are you in trouble.  For someone who has survived for so long, not being able to easily move from place to place, not being able to find housing without a government ID, etc.. it has made my life hard, and it's only going to get worse as technology keeps advancing.  Honestly, it terrifies me.  It makes me wonder how much longer I'll have here.

&gt; What parts of the world have you seen?

So many places! France (obvious if you read my other posts ;) ), UK, Germany, Poland, Ireland, Scotland, USA (current residence), Canada, and a *very* brief stint in eastern Asia.  I prefer colder weather, so I didn't last so long in Asia.

&gt; how active have you been... sexually?

Well.  I *did* promise complete honesty.  Huh.. How to answer this one.  Not very active, I suppose.  To be direct, I've been intimate with a few people, though it's rare.  It's so common to find vampires in popular fiction directly attached to sex and nightclubs, but that just isn't my reality.

I don't get aroused as a normal female would, and my body doesn't react to touch in the same manner.  That being said, I still enjoy human contact.  The act of sex itself may not matter to me, but the closeness of another person *does*.  Everyone loves to feel loved, right?  That's why it's rare.  I don't let myself love often.

&gt; Also what's the weirdest thing that's changed ""culturally.""

Jumping out of order of your questions intentionally!  Two things, and I call both of them unfortunate.

1.  How sedentary people have become!  There were always careers that required you to sit, but they were *rare* when I was born.  Most people I knew worked in agriculture to provide for their family.  The world industrialized, technology advanced, two-hundred years passed and.. well, here we are.  There's more money in a job at a desk than most other paths, and most people follow up with more sitting at home.

I've little room to complain about the 'coming home to sit some more', honestly.  If I could get fat, I probably would be, and I would blame it *all* on Netflix.

2.  How unfriendly the average person is.  Way back when, I didn't have many who lived within walking distance, but I knew those who did.  I feel as if today saying 'hi' to a stranger causes more off-put stares than pleasant smiles, and it really breaks my heart.  Something I've learned in my time here is that a single smile can brighten someone's day in ways you couldn't imagine.  Why is it that being friendly is now less accepted?

&gt; Also, I heard somewhere that you get your blood from willing individuals. What sort of people have done this sort of thing (although I'm sure you can find plenty of people in the S&amp;M community)

I'm actually going to answer this in another post.  I promised another user here a similar answer, but it's longer than a quick answer to your question.  I promise I'll tag you in the answer!  Come after me if I don't. :)

**Equality** - An incredibly rich, inheritance-tax exempt person being born into a position above every other citizen is undeniably classist.

Monarchy vs Republic is a rather principled debate in the UK, pragmatism doesn't really come into it for a lot of people, although there is:

**Money** - (Queue that incorrect CGPGrey video), the royals [don't own the crown estate](http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/our-business/faqs/#whoownsthecrownestate) (obviously even if they did that doesn't grant them a right to rule). We could abolish the monarchy and open up the palaces (that they don't privately own) all year around, increasing tourist revenue from those locations, hell even I'd be curious to take a wander around Buckingham Palace, it could be turned into one of the greatest museums in Europe. The royals would remain famous and regal in a post-monarchy UK, so their soft-power would only be slightly weakened, keep calling them Kings and Queens if you want, let them be famous for being famous, just don't give them tax money.

**Politics** - As you mentioned, they do hold influence over the commons (as famously noted by Charles' black spider memos), it may be small, but they shouldn't have that influence through right of birth. Also, the idea of a constitutional monarchy is that the monarch should be able to block Parliament when they view it as necessary, but obviously our monarch can't *really* do that, a British President could reign in the Commons' power if needed.

**Constitution** - Now it not being written down isn't inherently a bad thing, but it sort-of-a-bit-but-not-really resting in the hands of one person who isn't required to have any legal knowledge cannot be a good thing.

**Culture** - I simply, simply do not give a shit when one of them gets married or has a child and watching BBC News go into shutdown and my fellow countrymen worship their inherent superiors for a few days when it happens is a bit embarrassing, obviously that's a personal issue.

I'd write more but it's past 5AM and I'm supposed to be in uni in 4 hours. At the end of the day though, it's a broken lightbulb on a sinking ship, there are more pressing matters to change about our constitution.",ukpolitics,0,t3_3r50w4,,1449543399,0,,t1_cwl9vfs,t5_2qhcv,cwlb9xe,
Ducky14,0,0,False,1446441691,,"In the region directly around Israel, yes. The presence of a Jewish, westernized, American allied nation would certainly be destabilizing in a region full of Russian and Iranian allied Muslim nations.

In terms of stability in areas that don't border Israel, no. Iraq invaded Kuwait. Al-Qaeda usually away from Israel, since attacking a country that's constantly on guard and retaliates with extreme force is a bad idea. The Arab spring and the rise of ISIS have nothing to do with Israel at all.

The scale of other events like the Crusades, Ottoman conquests, etc. is also far larger than the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Those had far reaching global consequences. The New World was discovered partially because Spain kicked the Muslims out and financed Columbus' voyage. The Mongols created the largest land empire ever and caused trade to flourish between Europe and Asia.

marmulak,1,1,False,1446441861,taj,"&gt; So are you saying we should restrict travel for women

That's a separate issue completely.

&gt;Besides, how would you know most girls don't give it a thought? I bet you most if not all women in Iran have at least at one point given it a though.

Well I've known a lot of hijabis, and sometimes it's not an ideological choice they made, but they just do it because their family does it, or their peers do it. Most people who dress to fit in really don't care that much about clothes. I dress in a way that's considered normal in my society, and I don't care about clothes hardly at all. I don't sit at home thinking about what else I could be wearing, and I think girls are not so superficial to be only concerned with the way they look/dress. Lots of women have more important things to deal with.

&gt;But the fact is, the hijab is completely absurd. What is the purpose of it? Apparently men get sexual arosed by looking at a woman's hair? Or a woman's purity can't be contained if she doesn't wear hijab? ... That's absurd. It may have been correct at one point, 1400 years ago in Arabia, but not today.

I'm not sure how the time and place changes anything. Why would it be more correct 1400 years ago than today? Or why in Arabia and not somewhere else? Did humans just magically evolve out of the need to wear clothes at some point? I didn't get the memo.

The idea of whether or not it's absurd or useful is really arbitrary. You are just stating your own personal preference, but every culture dresses a little bit differently, and the fact that we wear clothes at all is possibly absurd, but the unusual amount of criticism levied against the way some Muslim societies dress is due to the fact that a foreign culture is attempting to colonize them and so there is pressure to assimilate. They put the other culture's practices under intense scrutiny, but not their own.

&gt;Richer countries? There are countries far far poorer than Iran who have infinitely better rights for women.

Iran doesn't give a shit about those countries. They want to do what Americans and Europeans do because they have newer cars and better televisions.

&gt;it's about providing basic rights to women

Arguing that people have the ""right"" to go about missing some article of clothing is a rather absurd thing to define as a right. People have the right to healthcare and affordable housing, but you don't see the same level of fervor in support of those causes as you do pressure for Muslim women to expose part of their bodies.

&gt;That's an awful example. Besides, you aren't forced to wear shoes.

In the United States it's a common business practice to refuse service to people who don't wear shoes. People who insist on going barefoot everywhere will face a social backlash of some kind.

&gt;Now imagine having to wear a monteaux and roosari in the dirty Tehran weather or the boiling ass weather in Southern Iran. It's not good.

Better than being seen by non-mahrams.

&gt;Its amazing how most people who complain that the hijab isn't that bad, it's just an article of clothing, have never worn it before.

Saying that hijab isn't so bad isn't a ""complaint"". :p I've been around hijabis for years. ALL complaints about hijab I've heard are from people (both men and women) who don't wear it. I've never seen a hijabi complain about hijab, although of course in the US it's mostly voluntary, so it wouldn't make sense for them to complain about it when they can just take it off.

Non-Muslims complain about everything Muslims do. I've been fasting for Ramadan for 8 years now, and everyone who *doesn't* fast complains about it and comments on how hard it is. People who actually do it don't think it's hard at all.

Also I've worn things on my head before. I'm pretty sure I know what it's like.",iranian,0,t3_3r03rg,👑 تاجیکستان,1449543442,0,,t1_cwkyjvk,t5_2s9nc,cwlbd8s,

And during the war Egypt, Brazil, Turkey, and India ramped up cotton production, soon matching the lost production from America.  So...Irish linen? Not so much, but Egyptian cotton, yeah.

JohnBullUncleSam,13,13,False,1446444076,,"&gt; They don't see it as a consequence of ideology.

I actually think it's a disagreement of what ideology caused it. The German left and centre believes it's 'nationalism', and thus all types of nationalism should be avoided and Germany must use the European project to surpass it. The German right (and people in other countries like the UK), see it being caused by a more specific blood-and-soil nationalism of the Nazis, and that there's nothing wrong with a moderate nationalism that's proud of national identity and traditional culture. This division also isn't just right and left/centre, but between the political class and regular people. 

So the migrant crisis explodes this division. The right/public wants to preserve traditional culture and worries about what vast immigration from the Middle East will do to German society and German ways of doing things. The left/centre/political class sees such cultural worries as being a stepping stone to another Nazi takeover. ",europe,0,t3_3r45dg,,1449543924,0,,t1_cwkz9yc,t5_2qh4j,cwlce1w,

Bony's signing in January was something I was completely against. It made the club look desperate as we were willing to do anything to get ahead of Chelsea. 

In November-December 2014, City went on a 9 game winning streak, (qualifying for the CL knockout stages in the process). 7 of those matches won were played without any strikers. The run ended in a 2-2 draw vs Burnley on December 28th.

We then began pursuing Bony as he had been one of the best strikers in the PL that year (yet still unproven in Europe). Following his signing on January 14th, we had to witness an FA Cup loss and exit to Middlesbrough, a PL loss to Arsenal and important draws vs Chelsea, Everton and Hull before Bony could make his City debut. Bony meanwhile was winning the African Cup of Nations. 

Bony played his first match with City on February 21st, over a month after his signing. You could argue that the period between him signing for City and playing his first match for City was the period where we had lost the title. 

So I'm really not sure why City pressured themselves into making the signing. It seemed rushed and impulsive. We didn't get to play him when our strikers were injured and as a result we lost important points. I'm trying my best to be supportive of him as I support any City player, but I can't help but feel frustrated at times when I think about the strikers we've lost. That includes Negredo.. 

As for Nacho, he definitely shows lots of ability and I would like to see him play as a striker on his own in the near future. He takes the chances he gets and has brilliant off the ball movement. Fits right into the system.

Samarthwiz,2,2,False,1446449062,,"1. Esperanto is actually slightly easier to learn according to a study conducted by the International Auxillary Language Association in 1993: 

&gt; Twenty university students having no particular knowledge of either Esperanto or Ido studied the forty-five correlatives of Esperanto and the corresponding words in Ido, for ninety minutes in each case. Ten studied the Esperanto on January 4 and the Ido on January 5. Ten studied the Ido on January 4 and the Esperanto on January 5.
&gt; 
&gt; Following the ninety minutes of study there was a multiple choice test. On January 6 there was a test in which the subjects were required to write the Esperanto and the Ido equivalents of the English words (all, always, each, every, everything, for no reason, how, etc.) Both multiple choice test and recall test for both Esperanto and Ido were repeated on January 23 and April 23. From January 9 to January 23 the subjects had twenty hours of teaching and study of Esperanto, so that only the tests before January 9 are valid for the comparison of the two languages. In these early tests the median number of the 45 multiple choices was 44 for Esperanto and 43 for Ido: the median number recalled correctly from the 45 English words was 32 for Esperanto and 15½ for Ido. The corresponding averages were 28 and 20. The Esperanto system was easier to learn for this group. But the experiment should be repeated with other groups.

2. Unlike French or German where the diacritic sounds are very similar to their non-diacritc sounds making them hard to remember, Esperanto ""diacritics"" are individual letters with distinct sounds, making much easier to remember. In addition since esperanto is one letter one sound it also makes it easier to spell words if you know how to pronounce them.

The cognitive dissonance that you are experiencing is real, but dealing with it is the only way that you can get past the insanity that is the propaganda that most people maintain as reality. 

It is not fair to call Oliver Stone a conspiracy nut. He has engaged with issues that are usually the subject of people who are easily dismissed as conspiracy nuts. The facts that he presents are all accepted facts. If there are any questionable facts, please present them. 

Every historian is a storyteller, history is a narrative that helps people understand how a culture got to where they are. Therefore, history is subjective, and it should always be investigated. 

The brilliant thing about Oliver Stone's presentation is that it points out how important it is that we get involved with the political process, and also how powerful corporate interests have been in every horrible thing that the US has been accused of. When I was a soldier in Europe in the 90's, I didn't understand why some Europeans hate us. Ever since then, I have tried to educate myself why. The history that Stone presents is the education that I have had to learn all on my own. I am especially thankful for this presentation because it keeps me from being the conspiracy nut. I can use this as evidence of my difficult to accept facts.

&gt;I'm also not so sure people with darker/lighter skin tones that aren't really catered to are such a minority that companies would be running at a loss to be more inclusive. 

I admit that when I said ""at a loss"" what I should have said that the revenue from selling those products probably doesn't justify the cost/effort. I mean if someone for example paid me $200 to work on Sunday, I'm not going to do it even if I'm giving up potential profits. Probably the same thing on a larger scale.

&gt;I think actually if you combined the groups of people with skin tones too light or too dark to fit into makeup companies' idea of what most women look like, we actually make up a very large percentage of the market.

You are probably very right on this. If they could just make a foundation that could suit all the remaining people, I'm sure they could. But you have to take that very large percentage, and break it down into specific skintones. They would have to bring in hundreds of shades if not more to fit everyone perfectly.

&gt; In fact, why is it that indies who are much smaller and have much less resources than major makeup companies (and therefore really couldn't survive if they were constantly running at a loss offering shades to the minority) are able to offer these shades if multinational companies wouldn't be able to afford to?

Indie companies usually have low costs/low revenue in comparison to big name brands. It's totally chill to offer heaps of range for them because they just operate out through a website and custom-making a few couple of darker foundations won't cost them much. If for example L'oreal here were to match the US's True Match range that would be a *huge* undertaking to roll it out to every big w, priceline, kmart etc. They'd only do that if they were absolutely sure every shade would be profitable, which I can't really see happening. For example the Fit Me Concealor has 5 shades of which 2 are decently dark. IME the light/medium ones are always sold out whilst there are always plenty of the cafe/deep in stock. They just wouldn't have the incentive to introduce even more of the dark shades.

I mean I really empathise and can totally see your point of view. It must suck not being able to go to priceline and pick up a cheap foundation when you need it.

But it's just that pretty much every for-profit company in the world operates with the main purpose of increasing profits/shareholder value. I would just find it extremely difficult to believe that heaps of make-up brands in Australia, Asia &amp; Europe just decided to forgo large amounts of revenue for no reason at all then to exclude people with darker skin tones. If not for lack of demand what reason do you think that make-up brands in the majority of the world do not stock darker shades?

But what exactly is culture? Is there a certain starting point you set and say ""from now on, this is and always will be the way we do things""? Where is that starting point?

 9 A.D. where we mopped the floor with Varus' legionaires?

A couple hundred years later, when christian missionaries made us "" voluntarily"" concert to christianity?

1871, when we finally dort of got out shit together and finally became a nation in the modern sense?

Or 1945, when we basically had to restart after a wild 12 years with a huge hangover, realising we sort of fucked up... big time?

Let's say out culture begins 1989/90, when large droves of weird looking foreign people with questionable politic background and a higher fertility rate than the West German population came over the wall and took their jobs.

Culture isn't stationary and always subject to change, sometimes violently so.
I'm still proud to say that I'm a German because even for the horrible things my people did, we also contributed to beauty in the world. If our time as a culture is up, we have noone to blame but ourselves. Being able to adapt is what made out species so successful. 

That's why I'm saying we should lead by example. Show the word and immigrants, why it is wonderful being a German and (way more important to me) a European citizen.
That does not mean you should let yourself be pushed around. But violence and hate will only escalate things, never solve them.

Ma fille a eu pendant 5 ans une maman de jour qui a aussi gardé pendant un an ma deuxième fille quelques jours par semaine. C'est une nounou comme on les adore, vraiment la vocation pour s'occuper d'une ribambelle de gamins même dans un espace confiné en hiver. Elle prenait les enfants à partir de 5 mois donc se voyait confier chaque année un bébé, ma fille étant la première. Une force de travail énorme, elle avait parfois 10 gamins l'après midi (donc les 4 petits non scolarisés, son fils, et des écoliers). Elle les emmenait toujours jouer au parc et fallait voir comment elle les alignait tous et distribuait fruits et biscuits. Toujours là pour faire les bisous sur les bobos et les calins, mais aussi sachant les punir et leur courir après. Elle travaille beaucoup car son mari est à la retraite et elle envoie de l'argent en Afrique où sa famille a fait construire une maison. Bref, une perle.

La seule chose que je saurais lui reprocher, outre le fait que malheureusement ayant des standards différents de nous les parents, ma fille se comportait affreusement envers nous tellement elle préférait la nounou, c'est que ses enfants et elle même étaient gros. Son mari aussi mais à passé 60 ans c'était un choix de vie contre lequel personne ne pourrait lutter. Mais les adultes, ça les regarde, d'ailleurs elle va souvent courir et fréquente le fitness, tant pis si elle mange trop de chips par après. Sauf que sa fille de 16 ans fait du yoyo avec son poids, et son fils... 

Son fils était parfaitement normal jusque vers les 6 ans. Super ami avec ma fille il s'amusait bien à courir partout. Il y a un peu moins d'un an quand ma fille a quitté leur maison il commençait à ressembler de plus en plus à son père, ce qui n'est guère flatteur, le monsieur devant peser 150kg au moins. Mais hier ils sont venus chez nous et le gamin est, je pense, médicalement obèse. C'est très choquant. C'est pas le manque d'exercice physique vu qu'il sort tous les jours, c'est pas les repas de midi vu que les autres enfants mangent les même et ne sont pas comme ça. Ca doit pas non plus être juste le goûter, je sais que c'est à base de fruits. Mais voilà, ça doit être le reste. Le soir il bouffe trop, sans doute. Ou alors il reçoit des bonbons... Je sais pas.

Et sa mère m'a bien fait rire. Je lui propose un cupcake que j'ai réalisé lors d'un atelier samedi. C'était moche et criard, le thème était ""girly"" donc colorants et paillettes et pâte à sucre en pagaille. Elle se saisit immédiatement du plus gros, il avait tellement de crème au beurre rose pétant qu'on le voyait plus. La dame de l'atelier s'en était même amusée, elle qui décore des cupcakes chaque jour professionnellement. Eh bien elle prend celui là, parmi la boîte de cupcakes dépareillés. Je lui dis bien ""c'est de la crème au beurre hein"". Elle le mange. Elle dit qu'elle aime pas. Eh bien, super. T'as raison, prend le truc le plus gros avant de savoir si t'aimes.

Du coup je comprends un peu mieux le surpoids.

C'était une histoire débile mais je trouve que c'est tellement symbolique.

I'm not sure why you've cherry picked parts of my comments but ignored the part which would answer your main point, nor have I suggested anywhere that brands are doing this simply to exclude people with darker skin tones. In case you missed it I'll quote myself:

&gt; Just off the top of my head NARS has a wide range of shades for example - I don't think they're putting them out at a loss! 

If it's such a loss, or such a great effort, to create extra shades, how are these two companies able to provide these?

&gt; I admit that when I said ""at a loss"" what I should have said that the revenue from selling those products probably doesn't justify the cost/effort. I mean if someone for example paid me $200 to work on Sunday, I'm not going to do it even if I'm giving up potential profits. Probably the same thing on a larger scale.

Again, as above. You also haven't addressed another point I made which is relevant here so I'll quote myself again:

&gt; I'm not sure how it would be such a great extra expense to mix more/less pigment into shades? It wouldn't involve any extra R&amp;D, or the creation of a new product? Just adding more range to a product that already exists. 

Furthermore, I think saying:

&gt; You are probably very right on this. If they could just make a foundation that could suit all the remaining people, I'm sure they could. But you have to take that very large percentage, and break it down into specific skintones. They would have to bring in hundreds of shades if not more to fit everyone perfectly. 

Is obviously unreasonable. To go back to the NARS example - do they offer hundreds of shades which fit everyone perfectly? I don't believe anyone in this thread would expect any company to do this nor have we said anything to that effect. 

In regards to the points you've made about indies - while indies do have smaller expenses in some areas, they also have much larger expenses than other companies in others. Furthermore, I'm not sure whether you work for these companies as you've got a lot of assumed knowledge regarding profit/cost, but if it's such a huge undertaking to add some shades to a range, why introduce the range at all? Would the cost/effort be prohibitive if it is so great that a few more products can be added? I'd love to be corrected with statistics and a break down of cost/profit analysis if you have access to this which your comments suggest.

Furthermore, I'm not sure what ""decently dark"" refers to, or what makes a product fit into that category. Does one of these two shades cater to women who are NC50? (Or for that matter, do any of the five cater to women who use NARS Siberia?) Also are you involved in the country-wide distribution of this product as I'm not sure how you would otherwise know that there are are ""always plenty"" of this two particular shades in stock. Additionally, if these two products are ""decently dark"" and are still on the shelves, would that not contradict your earlier point about how stocking shades to suit women of a deeper skin tone is too much of a waste of the companies' cost and effort? I think it's interesting you've only chosen to focus on darker skin tones when companies not stocking products for lighter skin tones is also a huge issue being brought up in this thread, and even was mentioned in the body of my post. 

Finally to address this point:

&gt; If not for lack of demand what reason do you think that make-up brands in the majority of the world do not stock darker shades?

Why do you believe that makeup across the entire world only caters to people of lighter skin tones, especially in light of this thread where so many other Aussie makeup lovers have mentioned their struggles in finding shades light enough for them?",AustralianMakeup,0,t3_3r5k8j,Melbournite,1449545306,0,,t1_cwleyhz,t5_2ys2j,cwlfb51,

In Europe, which Sanders is constantly comparing with, those two terms are essentially interchangeable.

The UK Labour party describes itself in some places as ""Britain's democratic socialist party"", in others as ""a democratic, socialist party"" and in others as ""one of the oldest and most established social democratic parties in the world"".

This is a false dichotomy being pushed either by Marxists or right wingers that want to paint all socialism as extreme Marxism. In mainstream political use the two terms are essentially synonymous.",politics,0,t3_3r4gtn,,1449545903,0,,t1_cwkur69,t5_2cneq,cwlgkrx,

&gt; A plane carrying the remains of 144 people killed when a Russian airliner crashed in Egypt landed in Saint Petersburg early on Monday, hours after investigators probing the doomed flight said it had broken up in the air.

&gt; The head of the Russian air transport agency Alexander Neradko on Sunday said it appeared the aircraft disintegrated while flying at high altitude, echoing similar comments from other top aviation officials.

&gt; Experts have dismissed claims from an IS-affiliated insurgency group in the Sinai that it brought down the aircraft in revenge for Russian air strikes against the jihadist group in Syria.

If you meant the bit where I pointed to Europe's imperial interests as an exception often to shared interest with the US, what I would have said if I had expanded was that this was supposed to be the case and was in many ways, accepting US aid and joining the UN implied work towards decolonisation and a historian of this particular subject could explain this better than I probably can. However the US was not by default anti-imperialist on every issue and indeed colonial regimes often were preferred to communist regimes, even if only for a period of transition.
