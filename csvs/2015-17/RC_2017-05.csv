&gt; Annihilator is a Canadian thrash metal band founded in 1984 by vocalist, guitarist, bassist, songwriter, engineer, producer, mixer, mastering engineer Jeff Waters and former vocalist John Bates. They are the highest-selling heavy metal group from Canada in Canadian history, having sold more than 3 million albums worldwide, although most of their sales have been generated outside of the band's home country. Their first two studio albums, Alice in Hell and Never, Neverland, are considered to be influential Canadian heavy metal records.

&gt; Since its inception, Annihilator has released fifteen studio albums and has undergone many line-up changes. Waters is the only remaining original member of the band, and sometimes assembles touring musicians to perform with him. Their latest studio album, Suicide Society, was released in 2015.

&gt; History
Early career (1984–1988)
Annihilator was formed in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada by Jeff Waters in 1984. Waters later wrote on his Facebook page that he named the band after the tank that Eddie Murphy's character rode on in the 1984 film Best Defense. Waters wrote and recorded the song Annihilator (not to be confused with the song of the same name released on the 1994 album, King of the Kill) with singer John Bates. This original version of ""Annihilator"" was released on the special edition of the 2005 album Schizo Deluxe.

&gt; Waters and Bates then recruited drummer Paul Malek and bassist Dave Scott. This lineup lasted a year, producing a demo titled ""Welcome to Your Death"" during their time together. The demo received worldwide recognition and became highly sought after. After John Bates and Dave Scott left the band before its release, citing ""artistic differences"" and ""personality conflicts"", Jeff Waters and drummer Paul Malek recorded another successful demo titled Phantasmagoria in 1986. This was said to be the third most-traded metal cassette tape in the 1980s, behind Metallica and Megadeth's demo tapes. Some songs written at this time, by Jeff Waters and John Bates, ended up on Annihilator's first two official studio albums (Alice in Hell and Never, Neverland).

&gt; A third demo was recorded by Waters and Malek in 1987 and was sent only to labels. It included more songs that would end up on the first two Annihilator studio albums. Waters relocated to Vancouver in 1987, where he assembled an entire line-up, including drummer Ray Hartmann and former D.O.A. bassist, Randy Rampage, on vocals. In 1988 and 1989, Waters was in and out of a recording studio recording guitar and bass tracks and producing what would become the band's debut album. Once the album was finished, he hired bassist Wayne Darley and guitarist Anthony Greenham.

&gt; Rise to fame (1989–1993)
The band gained more recognition within the metal community after releasing their debut album Alice in Hell, in 1989. Annihilator embarked on their first world tour, opening up for Testament along with Onslaught in the US and Canada, after which singer Randy Rampage quit the band to retain his seniority at a job on the shipping docks in North Vancouver.

&gt; Without a singer, Jeff Waters found ex-Omen singer Coburn Pharr and the band released their second album, Never, Neverland, in 1990. The album's sales surpassed Alice in Hell, becoming the band's only album to chart in the UK at No. 48. After opening up for Judas Priest, and then little-known Pantera and headline tours around the world, Hartmann and Pharr left the band and were replaced by Mike Mangini (though the band would find a more permanent replacement in Randy Black) and Aaron Randall, respectively. The band was signed to Sony USA by this point.

&gt; The band's third studio album, Set the World on Fire, distributed by Epic Records, was released in 1993 and was successful in Europe and Asia, but did poorly in the US. Bassist Wayne Darley had to leave the band in August 1993 as he was unable to enter Japan, where the band was touring in support of the album. Annihilator was among the many metal bands dropped by Roadrunner Records (and most other labels) that year.

&gt; Brief hiatus and later years (1994–1998)
The line-up then dissolved, but Jeff Waters kept the band name going when he, along with drummer Randy Black recorded and released King of the Kill in 1994. This album was more of a solo album for Waters, as it featured himself performing all instruments and writing most of the album's material apart from playing the drum tracks, which were recorded by Randy Black. Bassist Cam Dixon later joined the band followed by Lou Bujdoso from Meatwagon who went on to tour and perform during the King of the Kill and Refresh the Demon tours. Jeff Waters continued performing lead vocals until 1997. The band released Refresh the Demon, which was, for the most part, a return to the speed and technicality of the band's earlier days, in 1996 and Remains, a more industrial metal-oriented album which turned out to be the biggest flop of the band's career, in 1997.

&gt; By the time Remains was being recorded, Waters was the sole remaining band member. The album featured an electric drum machine (programmed by Jeff Waters, of course) and there was no tour in support of it.

&gt; Continued career (1999–present)
Annihilator did not play again until 1999, when Waters decided to reunite the Alice in Hell line-up to record another album. All members apart from Wayne Darley, who had health problems, agreed to reunite. Bassist Russ Bergquist joined the band in Darley's place. This lineup released Criteria for a Black Widow and toured successfully. However, Rampage was fired following the tour for his erratic and often drunken behaviour. Former Overkill guitarist and Liege Lord frontman Joe Comeau replaced him on vocals, while Curran Murphy replaced Davis on guitar and Randy Black rejoined on drums.

&gt; During the early 2000s, Annihilator released the albums Carnival Diablos (2001) and Waking the Fury (2002), both triumphant thrash metal masterpieces. After considerable success, the band's lineup once again dissolved. Following years of line-up changes, Jeff Waters decided to work with a touring-only lineup so he recruited Dave Padden as a permanent vocalist/rhythm guitarist, while Waters recruited touring bassists and drummers. Annihilator's first two albums in this three-man band format as Waters played both bass and guitar, with Padden on vocals and a hired drummer were All for You (2004) and Schizo Deluxe (2005). Mike Mangini rejoined for the former album in 2004 and Tony Chappelle was hired for the latter's recording in 2005.

&gt; In 2007, Annihilator released their twelfth album Metal. It features several guest performers, such as Corey Beaulieu (Trivium), Willie Adler (Lamb of God) and Jeff Loomis (Nevermore). The band's self-titled thirteenth album was released in 2010, coming to be in a more modern thrash metal-styled sound.

&gt; Annihilator returned to Canada for two live shows; the first time the band has played live in North America since 1993. On July 10, 2011, Annihilator headlined the Quebec City Imperial Theatre to a sold-out crowd. Annihilator played the main stage (along with KISS and Motörhead) on July 24, 2011 at Montreal's Heavy MTL Festival.

&gt; Annihilator released their fourteenth studio album entitled Feast on 23 August 2013.

&gt; In the summer of 2014, Oscar Rangel replaced Al Campuzano, their bassist since 2010. Jeff Waters said on his Facebook that he had actually contacted Wayne Darley, the bands bassist from the classic early 90's lineup, about having him rejoin, although once again he declined, in Jeff's words ""Wayne wanted to do it but couldn't ... personal reasons."" The band has continued their touring cycle since then.

&gt; Dave Padden left the band sometime in December of 2014, telling Jeff Waters over a telephone call that he was sick of constant touring and the lifestyle he was living in Annihilator and citing the biggest contributing factors were that he was away from his family too much and he had not been happy being in the band over the past five years, despite Waters' offers of more money after the next record was done. Waters then had to refrain from booking Padden's flight from Vancouver to Ottawa, admitting in a German radio interview he was emotionally shaken as well. After taking a couple of weeks' time and looking at various singers, Waters decided that he would handle vocals himself in addition to doing everything but play drums in the studio. The information was not made public until six months later, in June 2015, when Waters made the post on Annihilator's Facebook page, but attaching a YouTube link directly below of audio snippets from various songs on the band's then-upcoming album, Suicide Society.

&gt; Never, Neverland singer, Coburn Pharr surprised audiences when he returned for a short time on 70000 Tons of Metal concert in January 2015. Coburn will only sing, Reduced to Ash, The Fun Palace, I Am in Command, Road to Ruin and Stonewall.

&gt; By April 2015, Annihilator had begun work on their fifteenth studio album. Waters stated that the album's musical direction would be ""something quite different."" The album, titled Suicide Society, was released on September 18, 2015.

- modern units and modern geopolitical situation (I *think* it was relased in 2010-2015 and modern to that point)

TheAwakenedSaxon,,,"This post is going to speak in generalities, I will not make this caveat every time I make a general statement: there are exceptions to a general rule, if I say that Jews identify as Jewish, pointing out that one Jew does not do so makes you an obnoxious sophist wasting everyone's time, not a genius. 


&gt;""The only thing I have left to say is we, the Jews, are white until they find out we're Jewish.""


No, [you are not White](http://www.jewishgeneticdiseases.org/jewish-genetic-diseases/): ""It is estimated that nearly 1 in 3 Ashkenazi Jews in the United States is a carrier of at least one of 19 Jewish genetic diseases.""
Jews are happy to conceal their ancestry to the goyim, but they do not actually identify as White people. When a Jew like (((Moshe Kasher))) is chastizing Whites for ""cultural appropriation"", [he identifies as a ""white dude""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD-MUhMm7lM). When Jews are amongst themselves, when they promote from within the tribe, when they decide what policies they support, when they make decisions that can have major ramifications for White Western societies, they identify as Jews. This pretense of White identity is in no way contributing to a perception of Jewish honesty. 


&gt;Here are some of the reasons I've heard from other people on why they don't like Jews.
""They run the banks, the media, and politics!""
Success runs within the Jewish family...

Congratulations on completely missing the point, Jews tend to have a high verbal IQ, but apparently that isn't helping you to understand a basic argument, the issue isn't that you are successful, mere envy of the successful would not lead to any unique disdain for Jews. Although, if you believe that Communism has been a plague responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of innocent civilians, given [the Jewish role in Communism](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughLeftistSpam/comments/63bls2/jewish_communism_is_just_a_myth_right_guys/), that alone would be sufficient to detest Jewish intellectuals, acamedicians, and revolutionaries, as a group. 


The problem isn't that Jews as a group have (hugely disproportionate) control and influence over various institutions (media, academia, finance, 1/3rd of the Supreme Court, the judiciary) in White Western countries. **The problem is that you control institutions in White Western countries, you are not White, you do not identify as White, you do not identify with White people, you recognize that your interests as a distinct racial-religious group are in conflict with the interests of (historically Christian) White Europeans, and you use your positions of power to advance your well-being as a group, even at the expense of Whites.**


Identity is a vital component of a society, and Jews do not feign ignorance of the importance of identity when ignorance would harm them. Jews in Israel, if given the opportunity to elect an Arab Muslim Prime Minister who was raised with an enormous emphasis on historical Jewish crimes against Arab Muslims, and wanted to run Israel to benefit Arab Muslims, would vociferously decline (with their current demographics). If given the choice to have this Muslim same man to be a leading figure of a ""private"" media, finance, or legal institution (institutions which are so entangled with government they can hardly be considered private), they would prefer any reasonably competent Jewish alternative instead. If a Muslim does not identify with Jews, he is not going to run a country with a significant Jewish population to their benefit, at best, he is going to refrain from actively exploiting them on behalf of his identity group; this ethnocentric tendency, [as I have explained elsewhere](https://pastebin.com/yhkBaR0u), is a result of evolution, not culture. It is an innate tendency, and no sensible identifiable population would accept being ruled over by a foreign minority group which clearly did not identify with them. Why was native rule so considered so important for those in India? The same reason. Why do soldiers tend to favor officers who have risen up through the ranks from an enlisted status? Because they suffered the same hardships, and this officer will identify with and understand the enlisted men, and while this is evidence that ancestry is not the sole component of identity, historically, it has been an inseparable and fundamental aspect, with the only notable exception being decadent Whites in the West who have been brainwashed into prioritizing the privilege of nonwhites to exploit their societies over the right of their own children to inherit a country better than the one they and their parents had received.


Jews place an enormous emphasis on demonizing Whites in their study of history. Here is a summary of Jewish history, as they understand it:

-Rome: European pagans abused us

-Medieval period: European Christians abused us, kicked us out of almost every kingdom at some point (and clearly there was never a legitimate reason for this even a single time in all of human history, it's truly impossible that Jews could ever have possibly even slightly contributed to the negative perception of them held by Europeans), they massacred us before they went on Crusades, they taxed us heavily. Muh Rhineland massacres. Muh Inquisition. 

-Renaissance through 19th century: European Christians still subjected us to ill treatment, oy vey! Special taxes and other mean stuff that wasn't very nice. Muh pogroms. 

-20th century: THE HOLOCAUST (THE SOLE GENOCIDE IN HUMAN HISTORY WORTH REMEMBERING, IGNORE THE OTHER CLEARLY INSIGNIFICANT AND MUCH LARGER GENOCIDES OF THE 20TH AND PREVIOUS CENTURIES!!!)

Why would I want someone trained to believe my people are irredeemable to have power over my people?

Israeli Jews do not want Arab Muslims who learn history which demonizes Jews (accurately or inaccurately) to reign over their society, do I denounce this as some sort of irrational ""phobia""? No, because I'm not dishonest, but some Jews are eager to denounce even a [recognition of Jewish influence](http://takimag.com/article/jewish_wealth_by_the_numbers_steve_sailer/print#axzz4dFZLAV2G), even though [some Jews are happy to brag about their power.](http://www.gilad.co.uk/writings/jews-do-control-the-media.html) Even though Jews are whistling and avoiding eye contact as they exercise massive (but not exclusive) control of the levers of power in White countries, there is more than enough evidence of their influence, and given that we have no reasonable expectation that Jews will be as likely as Whites to support policies and make decisions that will most benefit Whites, why should White people tolerate this situation? Why should we Whites accept this situation at our own expense? Are you going to attempt to persuade me with moralistic principles which you don't even believe in as reason why I shouldn't support the curtail of the power of a group which (accurately or inaccurately) demonizes my own, does not identify with it, and [supports policies](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/chapter-6-social-and-political-views/) which come at [enormous](http://thealternativehypothesis.org/index.php/2016/05/11/fiscal-impact-of-whites-blacks-and-hispanics/) expense [to White people](http://thealternativehypothesis.org/index.php/2016/12/17/affirmative-action/)?  If so, that would be a wonderful exemplification of (((Saul Alinsky's))) rules for radicals: demand your opponent adhere to standards you yourself do not believe in. 


The Pew data can be used to show liberalism as a proxy for support of multiculturalism, and as we see with (((Neoconservatives))), even Republican Jews oppose the interests of native Whites in having a homogenous society. Why should I be content with Jewish power when it is used a tool to subvert my society and destroy those who oppose this subversion?


Identifiable groups exploit other identifiable groups, which is why Whites should not allow Jews to have enormous control over White societies: we Whites will inevitably be harmed when any group which does not identify with us holds power over us. This is exactly what leftists claim Whites do to every other racial group, we don't identify with them, and we advance policies and make decisions at their expense. Either White people are racist (identity groups exploit other identity groups) and it therefore a bad idea for White people to let other racial (identity) groups control their society, or systemic bias is a myth and leftists have been lying to us for decades, the only options are ""A or not A""; dishonest, pro-multiculturalism ideologues lose power either way when this is realized.

As an aside, I've always wondered if gendered languages make it easier or harder to learn another gendered language. It's hard for English speakers to remember, and seems a bit unnatural to remember that a mountain is a girl while a book is a boy (Spanish), but it seems that trying to remember a whole new set of gender designations that don't correspond with what you know would be doubly confusing. 

The entire concept of grammatical gender fascinates me, as it's something that English doesn't have (as fas as I know, it's only present in Indo-European and Semitic languages, and not universally so, as its absence in English attests!)",True,0,1493599810,,False,0,dgytz8p,t3_68ht4p,t1_dgysv7f,1494515503,1,False,NoStupidQuestions,t5_2w844,

The_Popular_Populist,,,"I hear that. I think thats a respectable opinion.

The problem is that not everyone can just go to school for one thing. The other problem is that the replacing jobs have either not emerged or they don't pay as well. 

For example low education service jobs like waiters and walmart clerks don't pay as well. Those are low-profit margin industries where labor is a large component of costs. Manufacturing actually has high profits and a much lower component of the price is labor, which is why those jobs pay better. So yes, education, yes, raise the minimum wage, expand social security, medicare for all. But autoworkers make $30/hr and you don't need a college degree, we need to protect and create those types of jobs as well.

The issue is economic growth is based on increased technology creating increased productivity, and if wages are growing, then peoples standards of living increase. So the 50/60's were a golden age for the middle class because unions made sure that if productivity in a factory increased, the workers were paid more. Their increased pay was spent in local communities which stimulated the local economy, and that wound up increasing everyones pay because service industries were doing better and had to compete with factories for good paying jobs. College graduates were also affected, because if you wanted to hire a college grade you needed to pay them enough to justify their going to college, and if they could be well paid just working at a factory, they'd need to be paid even more.

So what would happen is, if companies profited they'd invest the profits in the US and create new jobs. So even though factories might wind up needing fewer workers, a new factory would open up for a new product line. For example, though some auto factories may not have as many people, the iphone was invented and in the past, it would've been made in the US. Unions would also ensure workers were paid more with rising productivity.

This changed in the 70's when we had global competition and began running a trade deficit. This is the moment we needed to invest in protective tarrifs to protect jobs.

With globalization, the actual quality of goods made in other countries is often inferior and they have to spend money shipping them in from elsewhere then integrating them into larger products. (If its a component in a car for example.) The reason we export more with aerospace is because the quality needed for a plane is so high outsourcing isn't profitable. So the theory of free trade, specialization, isn't actually true. We're not worse at making certain products, we just have higher standards of living. 

And the flip side is, they don't have enough money to buy products from us. Half of China's population has an income of 2,000 dollars a year or less, they can't afford our goods and services, which is why we have trade deficits. 

But companies prioritized short term profits, so they outsource jobs with free trade. They generally don't lower the costs of goods however, they just increase their profit margins because they're spending less on labor.

They're just avoiding minimum wage laws, environmental regulations, labor laws, and unions. You'd never support letting a company open a factory in the US that paid its workers less than minimum wage, but if it happens in another country, suddenly its ""Trade"" and that makes it ok.

When our workers are forced to compete with lower standards of living, our wages go down and jobs are lost.

Other countries haven't done as poorly as us because of their stronger safety nets, but they have still had that same type of backlash. The european union didn't have any problems generally, until they included former soviet states. The poorer former soviet states are to them what Mexico is to us, suddenly companies would rather invest elsewhere. People lost their jobs. Unemployment increased in some countries and regions, wages have done down... 

The western world's middle class hasn't seen any gains from globalization. But the wealthy have benefited immensely. Which is why the richest 62 men have as much as the bottom half of the world's population. They use ""globalization"" to increase their profit margins, make products in poor countries and sell in wealthy countries, and break unions and bribe governments to prevent wages in poor countries from rising as much as they possibly can. 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-27/get-ready-to-see-this-globalization-elephant-chart-over-and-over-again

This inequality is a drain on the world economy. Our economy isn't growing because we aren't being paid enough, and we're not being paid enough because a lot of the best paying jobs have been shipped elsewhere and our wages have been lowered by sweatshop labor. Because we are the largest consumer market, but our wages aren't growing because of global competition, the demand for goods isn't increasing, so the motivation to invest and create jobs isn't increasing either.

Yet the countries that benefitted the most, China and Mexico, are even more unequal than the US, and have much worse human rights violations. We're enabling ruthless authoritarian China to continue to oppress its people, and we're enabling corrupt Mexican businessmen to do the same. Pre-NAFTA, Mexico's economy was growing rapidly. The same is true for many coutnries. All these countries have losers, not just the US. We lost manufacturing but they lose farming because of our subsidized agro-businesses, so farmers are thrown out of business, unemployed, and susceptible to working in desperate sweatshop factories which in turn forces Americans to lose THEIR jobs, be unemployed, and drain down wages for other industries.

When countries compete for the favor of multinational corporations, the workers and ordinary people lose, but if we made products in the US, like we did in the old days, our economy would grow faster because wages would rise with productivity and companies would be incentivized to invest in the US. That's really the root of the problem, why would you invest in Detroit or west virginia when you can get cheaper unskilled labor elsewhere?

And we know tarrifs work because we have them. We have a 25% tariff on trucks, the US continues to dominate the truck industry. They also incentivized Japanese and German car companies to invest in the US and make cars here. We built our industrial capacity up with protective tariffs because they encouraged companies to invest here, from 1860-1930. Then we were dominante, had no need for tariffs because we had no competition. Once competition began to reappear in the 70's, we needed tariffs. Instead we embraced free trade and a LOT of people have been hurt as a result. The top employer in the US used to be GM, which paid its workers very well. Today its Wal-mart, which does not. The transition from manufacturing to service jobs has dramatically lowered the wages of working class people and in turn, dragged down all our wages.",True,0,1493599859,,1493600314,0,dgyu0g4,t3_68fv0k,t1_dgypzyb,1494515518,13,False,SandersForPresident,t5_2zbq7,

Then the French and the brits and other european powers who greatly helped expand capitalism to the rest of the world. And finally the americans.

windershinwishes,,,"1. Was an artillery officer stationed the northern Italy theater of the War of the First Coalition, in which Great Britain, Prussia, Austria, and Russia teamed up against the brand-new French Republic. It was a backwater of the war that had been in stalemate for awhile and young Napoleon was frustrated with the leadership. He boldly and deftly lead an assault on a fortress, achieving a nice success and distinguishing himself. He also made a few connections, got promoted.

2. Was stationed to the Vendée, a rural region of western France that was in revolt against the Revolutionary government, in support of the Catholic church and the monarchy. Napoleon conveniently told the government he was sick, which conveniently got him out of fighting against Frenchman in a grueling occupation which would've probably been a bad career prospect.

3. Was in Paris just in time for a different up-rising, got appointed to command the police action to protect the sitting government. Better opportunity. Fought an urban bridge battle and put the revolt down with what history remembers as ""a whiff of grapeshot"" but was actually a pretty good fight.

4. Now having saved all the people in charge, got the command of the entire Italian theater. Spent awhile drilling his troops, then proceeded to go conquer the peninsula. Besieged Mantua and withheld like three attempts by Austrian armies coming from the North to break the siege through skillful control of Alpine passes. While he went he went ahead and started creating brand new subservient republics out of the city-state kingdoms he conquered, made the Pope sign a treaty officially agreeing to the various things France had taken from the Church during the revolution, and started peace talks with Austria, promising this and that--all of which he had no authority to do.

4. Came back to France a conquering hero with tons of loot. The government wanted him to lead an invasion of Great Britain (the only party still at war with France at this point) but he convinced them to let him instead lead an expedition to Egypt, as it was a major trading partner with Great Britain, and control of Suez (though there wasn't a canal yet) would hamstring their global trade empire. (Also he brought a team of scholars, scientists, archaeologists, etc. who did a lot of good stuff; a soldier found the Rosetta Stone and showed it to them, and they recognized its importance--it was an ancient decree written in three languages, one of which were the then indecipherable Egyptian hieroglyphics, which eventually allowed their translation.) After they landed, he instructed his admiral to sail off at the first sign of the British fleet because the army didn't need their support, just a way to get home. But the admiral thought that was dumb and that he could set up an impregnable formation at the Abukir Bay they were at. He was wrong, and the British fleet, lead by Lord Nelson, annihilated them. Meanwhile, Napoleon was showing the Mamalukes (foreign rulers of the Egyptians who were technically a part of the Ottoman Empire) how 19th Century warfare was going to be fought. He hoped that the natives would see the French as liberators, and ordered his men to show respect for Islam, not loot to much, threw a parade celebrating Mohammed's birthday, lots of stuff. But the local imams still didn't like all his Enlightenment reforms, and he had to put down an uprising with force...and the Ottomans, hearing about the naval battle, decided that fighting the French was the right call. Napoleon took them head on and marched into Syria, but between the actual Plague and tough conditions and well-armed Syrian forces lead by a French ex-pat, the campaign stalled out. Napoleon got news that there was instability at home and that a new coalition was forming against France (possibly because Bonaparte and his army were stuck in Egypt) and quietly caught a boat back home, leaving pretty much the whole army in Egypt to die.  

5. Took part in a coup to take control of the government, engineered by some of the people already in power; his wrole was to be the popular military figurehead. He ended up playing the political game better than the politicians though, and when the new constitutional dust settled he'd maneuvered himself into the dominant position of First Consul. He gradually consolidated more power, re-writing the constitution to grant himself a life-time appointment. He'd later crown himself (literally) Emperor.

At this point my detailed knowledge runs out because I got all this from the excellent ""Revolutions"" podcast by Mike Duncan, a portion of which was about the French Revolution, not Napoleon. So the rest may be out of order.

On the subject of revolutions though:

6. Haitian Revolution--he had a choice of allowing Toussaint L’ouverture, slave carriage driver turned highly effective dictator, to be an autonomous French client, but instead opted to send an invasion force to the island, dreaming of an American empire. It failed miserably, primarily due to yellow fever though it succeeded in destabilizing L’ouverture's regime. Napoleon later listed it as one of his greatest blunders in his in-exile diary. So bad for Napoleon, bad for France, bad for Haiti, but great for the U.S.--with Haiti off the table and the western hemisphere out of reach, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana (territory, not state--doubled the size of the US) at a bargain.

7. Napoleon was mostly leading his main army against the Russians and Austrians in central Europe, and succeeding. This culminated in the Battle of Austerlitz, known to history as his tactical masterpiece, in which he defeated a larger combined force of Russians and Austrians, lead by their respective monarchs. This battle caused the withdrawal of Austria out of the coalition, and the resulting treaty effectively caused the dissolution of the 1000 year-old Holy Roman Empire.

8. At this point the Prussians, who'd been out of the war, got back in, threatened by French ascendancy. But he kept kicking ass, defeating them, and the Russians again, forcing favorable treaties that left France in effective control of most of Europe. Britain was still holding out though on the back of its Navy; Lord Nelson again lead a devastating defeat of the French fleet at the Battle of Trafalger. Napoleon tried to restrict all trade between Europe and Britain to choke them out (the ""Continental System""), while the British smuggled into other European countries and blockaded trans-Atlantic trade.

9. He invaded the Iberian peninsula to conquer Portugal, which was thumbing its nose at him by lending their considerable naval / trade support to the British. The idea was that Spain would let him march through, but he ended up strong-arming the king into abdicating, installing Napoleon's brother as king. This helped spark revolutions against Spanish rule in South America, and more importantly to Napoleon, it caused a guerrilla war against French occupation in Spain, (it's where the word ""guerrilla"" was coined) supported by the British, which would be a constant drain on French men and money for the rest of the war, remembered by history as ""the Spanish Ulcer"". The French generally succeeded in any major battles, especially when Napoleon was there to lead himself, but they faced constant, gradual attrition.

10. Russia was also routinely breaking their treaty and trading with the British. Napoleon had had enough, so he took his almost 700,000 strong Grand Army to put them down once and for all. He was generally successful, but as previous posters have said, he didn't anticipate Russian scorched earth strategy. His plan to spend the winter in Moscow didn't work, since Moscow was burned down and every scrap of food and fuel for miles around had been stripped. His army, full of the best soldiers in Europe who'd been fighting with him for years, was devastated--more than 2/3 died or deserted.

11. This was the beginning of the end, as all of the other countries that'd been subjugated now saw the opportunity to start fighting again, but Napoleon wasn't taking it sitting down. A new coalition--the sixth to fight France--eventually defeated him at the Battle of Leipzig, in which 225,000 French soldiers were beaten by 380,000 foes.  The coalition invaded France, (insert political shenanigans and ""back-stabbing"") and Napoleon was forced to abdicated, restoring the Bourbon monarchy of France. 

12. Part of the negotiation of his abdication was that he be exiled to the Mediterranean island of Elba, which he would rule. He attempted suicide with a poison pill, but it didn't work. So, since that didn't work, he decided to try to re-conquer France...and did. King Louis XVIII was unpopular and the whole French Army missed Napoleon, and the whole country was chaffing under harsh treaty conditions. So during ""The Hundred Days"" after Napoleon landed, every military force sent against him defected to him, and he marched into Paris. A seventh coalition formed to put him down again, culminating in the Battle of Waterloo, in which British forces lead by the Duke of Wellington, along with Prussians and others which again outnumbered the French, defeated him. (Insert more political shenanigans and back-stabbing) This time he was exiled to the tiny island of St. Helena in the middle of the Atlantic, where he died.

Whew.

Napoleon was undoubtedly a genius. His innovations on the battlefield set the standard for how wars would be fought for a century. He also instituted a ton of modern reforms across Europe. The Napoleonic Code is the foundation of the civil law system used in most European countries, and Louisiana, and he enforced the use of the metric system which had been officially adopted just before he took power. He established basically all of the modern institutions of Egypt. He provided unity and stability in revolutionary France, though to be fair it's easy to be popular when you win and enjoy the fruits of conquest.

N0rthWind,,"Στην Αρχιτεκτονική σνιφάρουμε κόλλα, confirmed","Classicism is probably the most widespread movement across the planet.  
It was the first attempt at a revival of the classic Greek / Roman style, but due to lack of archaeological information and a bad understanding of the underlying principles, the works done during these periods were more akin to emotional/spiritual successors to Greco-Roman antiquity, rather than true revivals of the style. It was born in Italy during the Renaissance period.

Neoclassicism, on the other hand, became prevalent in France and then England after the very dramatic and over-the-top Baroque and Rococo styles started to go out of fashion. It's a much closer representation of what the classic antiquity looked like, rather than what it *felt* like to the respective architects.  
Afterwards, it spread to Germany and many other countries including the US and Russia.

Every country interpreted the style a little differently. In Europe, for example, many remarkable neoclassical buildings were constructed, always original ideas in line with the aesthetic principles of the style.  
In the US, on the other hand, they used the neoclassical aesthetic to stress out how free and democratic they were, and thus used it in a much more rigid way, even going as far as to literally copy famous classic temples to really nail the sense of freedom in there.

Funnily enough, Greece itself was one of the last countries to get into the loop, because it was under Ottoman rule for most of the time. After the revolution, Greece was looking to sever all ties with oriental influences and try to redefine its own identity, one lost for centuries.  
So it was very convenient that the revival of classic antiquity was very popular all across Europe at the time, because it hit two birds with one stone: it offered aggressive differentiation from the previous Ottoman aesthetic *and* for Greece, it signified a return to nobler roots. Plus it was super fashionable.

When that happened, lots of philellenes were interested in helping Greece with its makeover. The king that was imposed happened to be a big fan of classicism, so he brought along with him from Germany some well-known architects and designers, who indeed gave Athens a neoclassical facelift (pretty much all the neoclassical monuments in Athens are from that period).

(modern) techno at its core is about multiple layered rhythmic/percussive loops

(modern) house at its core is about a non-percussive, disco/funk-style musical groove, often carried by a low frequency bass line/synth.

Rarely in house music will you have something resembling [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU-UsvYbIV0)

Historically, techno would be more likely to use ""synthetic"" instruments, while house would use ""organic"" sounds like electric pianos, organs, wind/brass instruments, soulful vocal samples. Techno also historically is more likely to have a constant ride cymbal hitting 8th notes than house

All that being said, there is a LOT of crossover - and it didn't help that when techno/house both ended up in the UK decades ago record stores had no idea how to differentiate them much either. So at least you have historical company in confusion.

On to the examples...

In the opening of the Green Velvet set, you hear that bass line playing a little groove. By 4:45, another bass line comes in. Those kinds of bass lines are not typically characteristic of techno - much more of house thing to me

In the Carl Cox set, go to 49:00. No more ""groovy"" bassline, no ""human"" vocal singing a pretty melody, tons of percussive elements.

Adam Beyer's set, go to 1:19:45. Again, no grooving bassline, big booming kick, lots of percussive layers.

Jamie Jones' set, go to 15:50. Great example of the crossover, the whole ""deep/tech house"" style. Get to 35:30 and you'll hear a quick little riff of a bass line, often heard in ""deep house"" but a lot of the rest of that song is seemingly built just from percussive loops. 1:36:30 another great example of deep/tech house style.

Whenever people ask me what techno is I usually just play Jeff Mills ""The Bells"" as an example of techno. It's a great starting point to compare against what people call ""house"" music (e.g. Daft Punk) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Epe1KlU4gw

Jamie Jones and Green Velvet all have a bit of variation/flexibility in the house/techno space. Most of what Carl Cox plays at massives/big festivals is mostly techno in feeling with a smattering of soulful/deep house elements. Also, some of his other historical sets/productions over the years have a bit more variety. I'd say Adam Beyer is pretty close to ""typical"" techno out of all the 4

A better house/techno contrast would be like listening to [funky house](https://soundcloud.com/djdanmusic/sd-podcast-ep110) vs. [what I like to call ""straight-ahead"" techno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J84ZalC1u_g) ",True,0,1493603165,,1493804252,0,dgywj1g,t3_68dx7z,t1_dgys7ns,1494516739,2,False,aves,t5_2rev7,

We were a team consisting of belayers and leaders. In our job, if one of us makes a small mistake, another member can be injured. So, we have to be extra careful. 

&gt; We were at 22,000 feet at around 8 a.m on April 27. **We were all using the same radio frequency so when we saw them, we asked other Sherpas to stop them because ice can fall from high up. But they didn’t stop.** Even then, we tried to stop them, but they didn’t listen and continued to climb using our ropes

&gt;**They told us: We will not disturb you; we will take another route. After their assurance, we allowed them to go ahead.** By this time we had **reached 23,000 feet**. Our goal for the day was to complete the rope fixing up to Camp III and then go 600 feet farther. **When the Europeans traversed past Mingma Tenzing, our lead fixer, ice tumbled down and hit one of our crew members,** a Sherpa who works for Adventure Consultants. His face had bruises.

&gt;I don’t know whether they had dislodged the ice intentionally or whether it was just an accident, but pieces of ice were dislodged and that was the main issue. **Mingma told us that it was becoming too dangerous to continue. These people climbed up despite our call not to do so. Mingma said we should descend, so we followed his instructions.**

&gt;**Mingma had already anchored the rope and while he was rappelling down, Simone approached him and began the verbal abuse. “How much money do you need?” he asked Mingma. As this was going on, Ueli Steck stormed in and grabbed Mingma’s chest.** It was very dangerous to grab someone’s chest in such a high and precarious place. I was 100 yards below him at the time. I was leading on the right side while Karma Sarki was at Mingma’s side. **We had already decided to descend because the three were not only getting in our way but were also picking fights. Simone uttered words that were abusive. Ueli also pointed his ice axe toward Mingma.** I was scared at the time. We descended wondering why they had defied our warning and why they were keen on getting into a quarrel. 

&gt;**We arrived back at Camp II at around 2 p.m. Everyone was aware of what happened on the Lhotse Face because they all had tuned into the same radio frequency**. The overwhelming mood in the camp was that of resentment.

Federation:

The Genesis of Human Interstellar Civilization who formed as a pseudo United Nations to protect interests abroad from Sol. Unfortunately, they're a mega corporation in my eyes and seem to fit the 'Mericun Freedom stereotype far to well sometimes. I left them after I earned my permit to access our homeland. 

Empire:

I really, really, REALLY, *REALLY* don't like them. I don't like their ships, I don't like their political leanings, even their history is based on Genocide and warring with Walmar- I mean Tesc- I mean the Federation. They began as a colonial interest who tried to escape the grasp of the Feds if I recall correctly. I like their indentured servitude policy but I just can't stand all these dirty basking Imperial scum who think their glorified Iphone with a Frame shift drive duct taped to it is any better than my good old fashioned Ferdie. I do like the monarchy though, if only they didn't have any power and were just a ceremonial figure like the Old Earth Queen Elizabeth the II of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

Alliance:

Ah, now these are the guys I can get behind. They began from the ashes of a war between the Federation and the Imperials IIRC. Now they're a beacon of neutrality against the Grand Star War of Walmart and North Korea. I honestly wish they had a proper standing Navy. I remember oogling over some fan art of what an Alliance Capital Ship could look like and I wish they were an actual superpower rather than the modern day equivalent of the European Union (In some respects, even the EU might be a bit stronger than the Alliance)

Pirates:

You know, if you're a gentleman or lady Pirate who makes his demands first before he shoots me as I'm high waking the fuck out of there, you're alright by my book :) I'll give you some cargo if I can't blast your fucking brains out, you definitely deserve it for making these conflicts a lot smoother!

The common ancestor of both pandas (which also was an ancestor for all living bears; pinnipeds like seals and walruses; and members of the family Musteloidea like weasels and otters) can be traced back to the Early Tertiary period tens of millions of years ago, with a wide distribution across Eurasia.

Fossils of the extinct red panda Parailurus anglicus have been unearthed from China in the east to Britain in the west.[47] In 1977, a single tooth of Parailurus was discovered in the Pliocene Ringold Formation of Washington. This first North American record is almost identical to European specimens and indicates the immigration of this species from Asia.[48] In 2004, a tooth from a red panda species never before recorded in North America was discovered at the Gray Fossil Site in Tennessee. The tooth dates from 4.5–7 million years ago. This species, described as Pristinailurus bristoli, indicates that a second, more primitive ailurine lineage inhabited North America during the Miocene. Cladistic analysis suggests that Parailurus and Ailurus are sister taxa.[47][49] Additional fossils of Pristinailurus bristoli were discovered at the Gray Fossil Site in 2010 and in 2012.[50][51] The frequency with which panda fossils are being found at Gray Fossil Site suggests the species played a large role in the overall ecosystem of the area.

Iran is (relatively) freer. Their citizens and visitors are allowed to behave and speak far more freely than those in KSA, but they have hostile relations with the US (and many Euro democracies) so they will happily imprison, beat or kill you for violating their laws.

You would see USA rank, if not right at, close to 1st by any objective measure of freedoms and many of the European countries rank lower. Canada would certainly rank much lower than the USA being that they actively restrict speech.

My major concern is using sociologist in an objective study of freedom. Sociology is not an exact science and should not be included in a study about objective measures. At least not those of which can be easily measured by laws stated clearly by their respective governments.

The only explanation is that the freedoms given by law are some how not practiced in the USA but everywhere else does practice their law which afford their citizens certain freedoms (my guess is this is the ""abuse"" category). That requires an enormous jump in logic to single USA out as a place that uniquely states freedoms in law that it does not actually practice.

ActuallyNot,,,"This is a good beginners guide, but really only works in North America or Europe, where toads look like toads.

From [Australian Museum](https://australianmuseum.net.au/blogpost/science/frogs-and-toads):
&gt;
There are 55 families of frogs and toads, grouped together in the order Anura. The “true toads” (family Bufonidae) are just one of these.

&gt;
True toads are what we think of when someone says “toad”, and many species of true toads do have the “toady” bumpy skin, short forelimbs, and big ‘poison’ (paratoid) glands behind their eyes. Many species of true toads also crawl rather than hop, and lay their eggs in long strands instead of clumps. 

&gt; While a toad is easy to distinguish from a frog in most of Europe and North America, where toads look like toads and frogs look like frogs, it starts getting tricky in other parts of the world. There are frogs that look a lot like toads and toads that look a lot like frogs.

&gt;Perhaps the most amazing, and non-stereotypical, of the true toads are the Harlequin Toads (species in the genus Atelopus) from Central and South America. 

[Some examples from wiki are:

[True toad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayenne_stubfoot_toad#/media/File:Atelopus_flavescens.jpg)

[True toad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelopus_franciscus#/media/File:Atelopus_franciscus_with_internal_vocal_sac_-_journal.pone.0022080.g001A.png)

[True toad](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Atelopus_barbotini_3.PNG/338px-Atelopus_barbotini_3.PNG)]

&gt;And then there's the frogs that resemble toads in some way. These frogs often get branded as “toads”, even though they’re not closely related to true toads. In fact, hundreds of frogs in 14 families, including the Australian ground frogs (Myobatrachidae), fire-belly toads (Bombinatoridae), and the Asian toads (Megophryidae) get called “toads” (or even “toadlets” or- the strangest of all-“toadfrogs”), even though they're not.

* I understand Baahubali - 1 was a huge success in Punjab, which was interesting because apparently usual khan movies do not play well there, I heard. Pravhas had a huge gathering in one of the universities there, when he went there for promos.

TwoBionicknees,,,"It doesn't, Arsenal bring in around 100mil in tv revenue and 100mil in match day revenue. However we and Utd stand miles above everyone else in that regard. We were around 50mil from Highbury but at the time we were easily the biggest London club, we were in europe, winning the league, one of the big two and we charged way more for tickets than everyone else.... still fucking do :(

I think Wigan's matchday income was something nuts like 7mil, I think most clubs, were in the 18-30mil range and I don't know what Spurs numbers are, I suspect probably somewhere around 45mil mark. 

In terms of spending habits, meh, some promoted clubs have had significant profits but the majority of promoted clubs get into a pretty heavy debt funding their promotion and so that can be a wash. Some clubs who got up spending sensibly can have a very low wage bill initially compared to their tv income, but they also tend to spend higher than your average bottom half prem side over the next few years trying to bring in a better quality player.

The vast majority of clubs get to the prem league then overspend to try to secure a long term place, most fail and end up with a big wage bill and a lot of players they can't sell on too large wages for the championship. 

One of the reasons a bigger stadium gives you a better position is precisely because if you can get a bigger slice from matchday money you can put yourself on a different level financially to other teams who can't afford to do that.

Spurs and Sunderland will get not drastically different amounts of cash for TV, or lets say Spurs and Southampton as they are closer. WHen Spurs tv income goes up, so does Southampton's. If Spurs get a new stadium and generate an extra 50mil in matchday income, that creates a new 50mil gap to Southampton that gives them a major advantage, or another way to look at it is those with smaller match day revenue are at a major disadvantage. 

If Spurs can increase income by 50mil a year via stadium, then they bridge half the gap to Arsenal's spending capability... in fact if we're out of the CL and Spurs are in the CL next year, the other half of the gap will be gone anyway.",True,0,1493608623,,False,0,dgz0cqj,t3_68gpli,t1_dgyzn8s,1494518591,4,False,soccer,t5_2qi58,

(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)


Good morning.


Here’s what you need to know:


• In France, blue-collar voters could determine if Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate, upends expectations in the presidential runoff on Sunday. Ms. Le Pen has capitalized on their disenchantment with pledges to impose “intelligent” protectionism.


Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the candidate of the extreme left who won nearly 20 percent of the first-round vote, called on his supporters to not vote for Ms. Le Pen. But Ms. Le Pen would also benefit if disillusioned voters in the poorer, largely immigrant suburbs of Paris, many of whom supported Mr. Mélenchon, abstained.


Ms. Le Pen said that she would name Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a Euroskeptic former rival, as her prime minister if she were elected. Emmanuel Macron, her centrist rival in the coming vote, visited two sites tied to France’s wartime history.

• Young people across Eastern Europe are increasingly protesting the consolidation of power among corrupt politicians and untouchable oligarchs.


In Slovakia, we met a pair of teenagers — Karolina Farska and David Straka — who have become unlikely media darlings with their anticorruption message.


“People say we are naïve, and I guess we are naïve,” Ms. Farska said. “But we are learning, and we are not alone.”

• Thousands of Russians gathered to present letters of protest at government offices, the second widespread show of public discontent in two months. Over a hundred people were arrested in St. Petersburg and in other cities.


“We have Putin, we don’t need food,” read one sarcastic protest sign in the Siberian city of Tomsk.

• In Sweden, last month’s terror attack by an Uzbek man whose asylum claim had been rejected has some calling for a crackdown on illegal immigration, which in turn raised fears among rejected asylum seekers.


But the country is ill-equipped to deal with the challenge. The police estimate that 12,500 out of 18,000 rejected asylum seekers have gone underground. Sweden received 191,000 asylum applications in the last two years.

• President Trump celebrated his first 100 days in office over the weekend, bathing in the applause of a crowd of his bedrock supporters and reviving falsehoods about the economy and the news media. Mr. Trump became the first sitting president since Ronald Reagan to address attendees of the National Rifle Association’s annual convention.


Congressional leaders reached a bipartisan agreement to fund the U.S. government through September, averting a shutdown next weekend.

• Ben Brantley, our chief theater critic, is reporting from London’s West End this week. Here’s his review of the musical “Dreamgirls.”


“The show comes roaring at you like a souped-up, chrome-plated luxury sedan,” he writes.


Today, the presidency of the U.N. Security Council changes hands.


That’s because the five permanent members and the 10 nonpermanent members each hold the role for one month, following English alphabetical order.


Sweden was up when the year started. Ukraine took February and the United Kingdom got March. The United States held April and now hands off to Uruguay.


Next month, the order starts back at the top: Bolivia, then China, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Italy and Japan.


This is just the second time that Uruguay, a U.N. founding member, has held a Security Council seat. The first, in 1965-66, came after a reorganization to increase representation by those who are not permanent members of the council.


Uruguay helped Singapore and a handful of other nations create the Forum of Small States, meant to allow small U.N. members to amplify their messages.


For May, Uruguay’s ambassador, Elbio Oscar Rosselli, above, organizes and speaks at meetings and sets schedules.


You could say that he is well named for the role of international diplomacy. “Oscar” spread across Europe and beyond thanks to the popularity of the epic works by the mid-18th century Scottish poet James Macpherson.


The name has two possible roots: from Gaelic, meaning “friend of deer,” or from Old English, meaning “sword of God.”

Is up to us and our abilities to work together and understand each other otherwise the food would be shit.

If we do manage to work together and understand each other the food will be tasty.

Regardless of the quality of the food we manage to cook up we still have to clean the entire kitchen 3 times a day after every cooking session no slacking!

Basicly if you want to have it good be ready to work for it every day. 

I like how people seem to think they are special snowflakes and reach the conclusion: EU is bad because my life is bad. What has  EU done for me?

EU is not supposed to make your life better is supposed to guarantee you that IF YOU WORK towards your happiness that is exactly what is going to happen. 

When i say ""you work"" is not ment just in the literal sense of doing a job is actively pursuing the things that make you happy and finding a way to make a living out of it.

TOKYO —  Asian shares were mostly higher Monday despite worries over regional tensions after a North Korea missile launch failed over the weekend.


KEEPING SCORE: Many markets in Asia and Europe were closed for Labor Day. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 0.4 percent in the morning session to 19,274.99. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 was up nearly 0.1 percent to 5,927.60.


WALL STREET: U.S. stocks closed modestly lower Friday. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slipped 4.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,384.20. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 40.82 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,940.51. The Nasdaq composite lost 1.33 points, or 0.02 percent, to 6,047.61.


NORTH KOREA: The failed attempt to launch a mid-range ballistic missile on Saturday added to regional uncertainty. President Donald Trump has warned that the U.S. ""can't allow"" North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un to develop better missiles.


THE QUOTE: ""The market mood remains relatively cautious ahead of a big news week that will include the French election and U.S. jobs data,"" Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said in a commentary.


U.S. ECONOMY: U.S. jobs data will be released later this week. The Labor Department said last week the U.S. economy turned in its weakest performance in three years in the January-March quarter, reflecting a slowdown in consumer spending. Growth, as measured by gross domestic product, amounted to 0.7 percent in the first quarter, less than what economists were expecting.


FRANCE FACTOR: A runoff election is set for Sunday for the French presidency between centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen. There are worries about growing nationalism.


ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 8 cents to $49.25 a barrel. It rose 36 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle late Friday at $49.33 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 16 cents to $51.89 a barrel in London.


CURRENCIES:  The euro edged down to $1.0906 from $1.0924 late Friday in Asia. The dollar strengthened to 111.65 yen from 111.44 yen.

Taleofpurple,,,"&gt;One of the ways that Christianity has corrupted Europe is by ending the very beneficial practice of only living in ""tribes"" of no more than 150 people. This allows us to be self sufficient and makes it easier to defend our land against foreign invaders. 


It makes it harder for immigrants to get in different areas for sure, but how are your 150-man tribes going to stop a single army of 10,000 people? Europe could have a population difference of 1:1,000 with the invaders but because they are divided, they can be easily conquered.



As for Communism, even if the prevalent religion was different, I would say Communism would still spread. Look at universities and colleges, they aren't really the most ""Christian"" of places but they sure are pro Communism. Communism is too ""ideal"". People see others in superior positions to them, attribute it to inequality and unfairness. They want to make it ""fair"". Communism looks fair to them, atleast they get to drag these ""bourgeois"" down to their level. The only thing that kept commoners in the past from implementing such a system was a lack of military power (in the hands of the ""noble"" class)... and maybe that they didn't have the ability to think of such a system given the horrid education(if any) they had.

Gauquelin demonstrated through repeated research the influence of planetary bodies on humans.  His findings were vigorously attacked to persuade the man and woman in the street that astrology was a nonsense.  Those in power did not dismiss Gauguelin's evidence however and their involvement in ancient occult practices was bolstered and increased

TL; DR; humans are all a single species. Adjacent population groups of humans interbreed unless some barrier exists to prevent it. ""Races"" roughly correspond to five major geographical groupings of humans - sub-Saharan Africans, Indo-Europeans (who include everyone from North Africa and Europe to South Asia), East Asians, Australonesians, and Amerindians - which are separated from each other by major geographic barriers (the Sahara Desert, the mountains/deserts/jungles of Asia, Oceanic expanses in the case of Australonesians and Amerindians) which restrict interbreeding. However, there is mixture between these groupings along the edges - the Nubians and Egyptians mixed along the Nile River, the East Asians and Indo-Europeans mixed in South/Central Asia, the East Asians mixed with the Australonesians, ect.

The main argument from a biological standpoint is whether ""intermediate groups"" like the Egyptians are properly seen as ""intermediate groups"" or if they are simply part of a larger gradual population cline (basically, continuous variation within a population). It is about the relative level of distinction of groups, and how fuzzy the edges are - are they big areas of relative sameyness with thin areas of change along the edges, or are the edges thick and part of a more gradual transition between various gene clusters?

From a realistic standpoint, it is ultimately a problem akin to ""when does a pile of sand become a heap?"" or ""When does a dwarf planet become a planet"" or ""When does a ball of gas become a star?"" There's a difference between Jupiter and the Sun, but there's a lot of things in between which are not all that different from each other. Having separate categories for stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant is useful, but in the end there's some point at which you add just a bit more gas and it goes from a gas giant to a brown dwarf or a brown dwarf to a star.

This doesn't mean that categories are useless or don't have any meaning, but it does mean that they might have fuzzy edges and aren't absolute things.",True,0,1493617137,,1493617799,0,dgz4wa6,t3_68fd3g,t1_dgyw427,1496159511,3,False,forwardsfromgrandma,t5_2t776,

wasmic,,,"I'm not American either. I live in Europe, close to a pretty big city that is very public transit focused. 

No, that's not how it works. Inner cities are expensive, because it's close to where all the night-life and where the workplaces are. Therefore, mostly corporations and shops can afford to be there. Thus, there are few people who live there. More people live in the outer city (still the city proper, and not the suburbs). While these areas are less expensive, they're still within the desirable zone, and aren't as wanted by corporations, allowing people to live there.

Your assertion that ride-sharing kills public transit is unfounded. In my city, there are six radial lines of commuter and suburban rail, with departures every 10-20 minutes, depending on the line. In addition, there are three metro lines in the city, soon to be 5. Complementing that is a large amount of bus lines, some running far out into the suburbs and skipping most stops, others running only in the city, as frequently as every 3 minutes in some cases.

If you live and work in the city, public transit is the fastest way to get to work. If you live near a suburban train station and work in the city, public transit will usually be about 30 % faster than a car, and they're working on making the trains even faster. The 30 % is without counting traffic, which slows cars down even further. 

Why would the people who commute by train decide to suddenly go with a slower option? Automated cars will still have to keep to the speed limits, and there will still be traffic jams, though they will be less frequent and will be resolved faster. 

It won't be necessary to restrict the cars themselves (although I think it sounds like a good idea), all that needs to be done is to restrict the size of the streets. This is already in progress, with buses being given priority lanes, and sidewalks being expanded at the cost of space for cars.

Automated cars will still be somewhat slower than public transit, especially for transport within a city. Unless you cave to the pressure and redesign the city to prioritize cars (which is a shitty idea, as proved through then 60's and 70's), public transit will still be competitive. 

In addition, public transit will also benefit from automation. For example, buses will be able to run twice as frequently for the same cost if no driver needs to be paid - or at the same frequency but half the cost.

But nationalism still runs strong in some parts of the world less affected by the destructive nationalism of the Nazis. Ethnic nationalism is still very strong in South Korea and Japan, and is considered an essential component of their citizenship laws (immigration to these countries is extremely low with most citizenship applications falling under spousal sponsorship).

Here's the problem with that, though. Let's assume for simplicity's sake that all of Europe supported the US (let's call this alliance 'The West') in an actual war on Islam. That makes up all your allies. The US interfering with and destroying other cultures would make S.Americans feel VERY sympathetic towards Muslims. At *best*, Russia will not engage in direct war but will supply weapons to anyone working against The West, because a broken destabilized Europe is perfect for them.

Now, what about China, Japan and Korea? I'll be honest, I'm not sure where they'd lean in the event of a conflict like this. While they're not exactly fond of Islam (or any of the Abrahamic religions) they most certainly won't want to be embroiled in a culture war that they have no part of.

Fast forward a couple of decades. Europe is pseudo-Russia, South America has been set back several decades, the Middle East, North Africa and half of Asia is either back in the stone age or is a glassed wasteland.

IMO, a war is going to be horrible for everyone and will just set humanity back a couple hundred years. The current situation is perfect. Saudi Arabia and most Muslim countries are reforming, fast.

magic_meadery,,,"&gt; I don't know why the original comment this user responded to has so many upvotes.

I'll probably get downvoted to oblivion, but it's because it just isn't that big of a deal to most of us. Yes, a lot of Americans are uninsured, but these are mainly in populations that the typical Reddit population does not interact with. That's not saying the system is good - and I'd prefer a single payer system - but we are tired of foreigners thinking we are all dying of sickness on the streets. The truth is although we all complain about it, if a white collar European moves to America, he probably won't have to deal with all these uninsured people and he himself will probably get decent insurance. 

And for most Americans, 3000$ out-of-pocket is a reasonable expense. I feel for you if that is a big burden on you, and like I said, I want a better healthcare system, but the truth is that most middle class Americans can shoulder this burden (actually 3000$ is kind of high. Mine is only 1500$, but still...). 

As for your cancer comment, that's absurd for me. I have compared many insurance premiums and compared with many friends, and insurance would definitely cover cancer treatment. Perhaps you have bad insurance?

I have a $6k annual premium with $1500 out-of-pocket, and I am in my mid-20s. That is higher than I would like it to be,  but it isn't a drastic burden on my life such that I am literally dying on the streets with sickness. 

And on top of that, most employers cover insurance.

If none of this applies to you, then I'm sorry. You said you are a white collar worker, so this shouldn't be such a burden for you. But still realize, you are the **exception** in terms of white collar workers. And I understand that when you are the exception, it certainly doesn't feel like you are the exception. Still, that's just how it is, and that explains why the top comment is optimistic.

Like most Jews, it's the only thing he/she can identify with. Ironically, when Theodor Herzl founded modern Zionism, everyone including most Jews considered it as an inherently anti-semitic ideology since it encouraged the idea that Jews don't belong anywhere except in their own state. European anti-semites loved the idea including Hitler himself. Many of them supported Zionism simply because they wanted to get rid of the Jews once again; who doesn't? amirite? Yet today you criticise Israel and they try to use the anti-semite card, how pathetic.

Hitler came along because Germany saw what was happening and wanted to prevent what America is today: a nation controlled by a Jewish oligarchy along with a government infested with parasites who are loyal to a foreign entity. These Jew imposters created communism and also led to the downfall of the Ottoman Empire from within with the secretive Committee of Union and Progress (Young Turks). Add a touch of Armenian genocide which Israel conveniently doesn't acknowledge... but muh Holocaust. There were barely 6 million Jews in eastern Europe and the USSR at the time and half of them were in the USSR so how did Hitler kill 6 million Jews? Too much stinky bullshit. We now know that between 200,000 and 300,000 died and most of them died due to uncontrolled Typhus disease. 

Meanwhile communist Jews under Stalin intentionally starved nearly 8 million Ukrainians to death during [Holodomor] (http://www.holodomorct.org/history.html). The director of the NKVD was a soviet Jew named [Genrikh Yagoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genrikh_Yagoda) who was also responsible for the murder of about 10 million people; he was the real Hitler yet the Jew media and Jew history books don't mention anything about it.

powderizedbookworm,,,"I do understand where you’re coming from, but there are plenty of people who consider themselves big Velvet Underground fans, despite not having listened to everything they could find.

When I was in high school, my mom used to love to make me go to church on sunday, more as a way to exert some control over me more than anything. Sometimes I would go, sometimes I’d just drive around town, sometimes I’d get breakfast. But I’d always listen to “Sunday Morning.” I liked that first line “Sunday Morning/Praise the dawn in.” It took the edge off the annoyance and anger, and it made me feel the light and possibility of the years ahead.

I didn’t always listen to the album straight through, but between my Sunday morning sessions and just pulling it out to listen, I would say that there were a couple years where I listened to it every couple weeks (sometimes skipping European Son).

Years later, I would fall in love with a girl at a summer internship. Months of maybe/maybe not later, I visited her at her college. One of her good friends there was very into music, and I got the impression that our mutual love of The Velvet Underground and Nico brought him out of his shell more than he usually did around new people, even though my favorite was the fairly pastichey Sunday Morning (still is), and his was Heroin.

I wasn’t quite sure where I stood when I left her, she was a bit cagey, and I was terrifyingly in love. I listened to that album on the way home, and when I got to “I’ll Be Your Mirror” I put it on repeat for a few listens. That laid back little guitar line, the jangly rhythm section, and that line “Please put down your hands/Cause I see you/I’ll be your mirror…” 

She broke up with me a couple days later, but I would have been her mirror forever. I have never been more devastated, and five years later, I still haven’t fallen in love again. Cue John Cale’s apocalyptic viola from “Black Angel…”.

Largely due to that breakup, I ended college sitting on the edge of depression. I moved back home. Once again, my mom seemed to get a kick out of making me go to church on sundays (and more charitably, knew it was good for me to get out of the house). And once again, I’d drive around in the clear, cold Teton mornings with Sunday Morning playing.

I felt like I’d failed the most important trial of my life, and that due to not being charming, or confident, or *something* enough, my life would always be noticeably empty. I held on to that line about “the wasted years/so close behind,” comforted by the fact that someone understood what I was feeling. All the streets I’d crossed, not so long ago, haunted me then (and still do, even though it is so long ago since I’ve crossed them now...). It’s all the more bitter for how much the song also reminds me of youthful optimism and energy.

[deleted],,,"&gt;I know it's out of order of what you said, but that was my favorite part of your whole post. It really just highlighted how dense you can be. Like the answer is right there and you even quote it. You have to admit that's pretty funny to laugh at.

Yup, I'm the dense one even though you completely ignore a big four show being much more of a draw than a b-show or Network exclusive show.  You said it yourself, no one would give a shit.  Even though the UK is desperate for a PPV, the draw and interest and higher price tag for tickets (and the potential for more Network subscribers) will be *higher* if it's a big four show.  Keep up.

&gt;India.

Which is in Asia.  I already explained the benefits of doing a UK PPV for Europe and Asia.  For reference: India is only four and a half hours ahead of London.  An 8pm London start time would mean a 12:30 am start time in India as opposed to the 5:30 am start time that PPVs usually begin.  Staying up late is preferable to waking up, watching half a PPV, then going to work.

&gt;Yeah you know all those big shows like Game of Thrones, Better Call Saul that debut at 3pm. There's a reason its called PRIME TIME Television. Its the time the most people are watching TV. Seriously stop ignoring logic in attempts to grasp at straws.

And this is where you're completely overlooking what the end goal of holding a UK PPV would be: Network subscriptions in markets where a live PPV would be a lot more conducive to their schedules rather than the middle of the night or the middle of the work day.

&gt;Hell look at TV ratings in the UK. Shits at 100,000 people. Are we expecting nearly all of the TV viewers in the UK to show up to this PPV in the first place? Or how about the part where UK taped delay raws dip in numbers? hmmm wonder if that is comparable at all.

Although the gate was the original question, our argument has strayed elsewhere.  They'd sell it out and they'd get a higher gate for a big four show since they'd charge more for it.  

The two replays shown of Raw are on Thursday and Friday at the tail end of the work day.  *Of course* ratings are going to be lower.  People aren't at home to watch.

&gt;Are you really trying to compare Paul Heyman and Attitude Era run smackdown to now and act as if that isn't a major cause for ratings? No shit a better run TV show that has more interest will do better than WWE today. Lets discuss other obvious, but irrelevant things like how water is wet.

*That's exactly the fucking point!*  A better run TV show will move the needle.  For all the grandstanding you've done about live mattering so much when watching wrestling, the ratings have barely moved since SmackDown became a live show.  When SmackDown was a taped show and it was a hot product, the ratings were larger even though spoilers were available for days beforehand.  Holy hell, I thought that much was obvious.  And I'm the dense one?

&gt;You know there is a risk you even say it.

Yup.  Never denied there was one.

&gt;What's the reward exactly?

People in overseas markets hesitant to sign up for the Network because the PPVs, the real draw of the Network, are typically at times where they're in the middle of the night or worse, coincide with the beginning of their work day.  The idea would be that the novelty of having a PPV at a reasonable time would increase subscribers.

I realize that the selling point appears to go against what I've been saying but going live, as a novelty rather than as a regular viewing habit, may sell.  It's not much different than hoping that SmackDown going live would increase ratings substantially on a weekly basis.  If it works, great.  If it doesn't, oh well.  I wouldn't foresee people canceling their subscriptions because of it which would be the downside of making the move.

&gt;A larger gate isn't worth the loss of people signing up for a Summer Slam that will say nah after they've already read the results, or saving 10 bucks for a month since they will just be getting the results 5 hours before they see it, in their largest market.

Again, you're assuming people would wait until the normal viewing time instead of watching it in the middle of the day on Sunday.  What's going to compete for attention in the afternoon on a Sunday in August?  Football season hasn't started yet.  The change in time would be known months in advance.  People can plan accordingly.  And even if people choose to watch on delay, so what?

&gt; Germany Has an Arrogance Problem

&gt; By then[after the German Unification], most — but not all — of Europe trusted Germany, understanding it as a democracy willing to sacrifice its immediate interests for a European community [...].
&gt; The difference, explains Sir Paul Lever, a former British ambassador to Germany and author of Berlin
&gt; Rules, is that Germany is in the driver's seat.
&gt; 
&gt; U.S. economist Paul Krugman repeatedly blasts Germany for ""Moralizing"" on European fiscal policy, namely 
&gt; Germany's obsession with budget discipline, which he considers entirely counterproductive.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem with this is that Germany's surplus leaves many of its trading partners, such as the United
&gt; States but also France and southern Europe, with unbalanced current accounts in their bilateral trade with &gt; Germany, which exacerbates their export-import imbalances.
&gt; 
&gt; There's wide agreement, among German economists too, that the country's export prowess is in large
&gt; part the product of a low euro, low oil prices, and relatively low wages in Germany.
&gt; 
&gt; German exports benefit immensely from a euro that, for Germany, is undervalued.
&gt; 
&gt; The balance-negative eurozone countries say Germany has to give back, too - not just take.
&gt; 
&gt; McAllister, a believer in balanced budgets, acknowledges the disapproval going around, but responds,
&gt; ""Those countries criticizing Germany might like to ask themselves why they aren't as successful, and
&gt; instead of complaining look at why Germany is, and learn from that.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Even when Germany does something obviously decent and generous, like taking in so many refugees, it's 
&gt; accused of arrogance and unilateral behavior,"" he says.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We can't be as humble as we were in the Bonn Republic, because Germany has more responsibility now
&gt; that it can't shirk. There's a new Germany that's not aggressive or intolerant.""
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, another reason German smugness can get under the skin is the fact that Germany simply isn't
&gt; nearly as universally superlative as it might prefer to think.
&gt; 
&gt; So Germany may browbeat other countries about their deficits today, but other Europeans remember that
&gt; in the 2000s, when the German economy was in the dumps, and again during the financial crisis, Berlin
&gt; consistently ran budget deficits in excess of eurozone rules - and avoided penalties for it.

Luxus90,,,"Many historians agree that the Maginot-line was indeed the best strategy for France. France after all had lost (proportionally) more soldiers in WW1 (the so-called 'hollow classes') and hence had a numerical disadvantage. Investing in state of the art defense in depth on a relatively small front was a sound strategy. 

There are of course those who point to Charles de Gaulle, who advocated a fully armored tank army which - in his mind - should drive straight into the Ruhr instead of a more defensive strategy, but this would have most likely proven to be industrially and financially impossible for France. 

The doctrine had a number of flaws though. Most notably, the French assumed an economic blockade (by the UK) would be just as effective as during WW1 -- but now the USSR was still freely trading with Germany. The Nazi-Soviet pact (assumed to be political polar opposites) came as a complete surprise for French strategists. 
 
The Germans though, weren't really the underdogs in this and they did have a lot to lose. In 1940 they had secured the East (occupying Poland + forming alliances with many central European states) and had a solid defensive position. Air raids did not yet exist and an Allied offensive was just short of impossible.

Yes they had less tanks - and many would argue that they had inferior armour in 1940 - but they did have the better air force and their infantry had been training for years and was able to see real combat in Poland.  

It wasn't a surprise that the Germans tried to bypass the Maginot-line either, in fact the French expected them to do so. But they didn't expect the main force to pass trough the Ardennes (which was considered impassible for armoured vehicles) which effectively split their forces. 

In short a superior strategy, better communication and combined arms tactics allowed the Germans to win; not luck.


That said,  assuming an alternative scenario in which they would not   have attacked the West: 


I think it's most likely that neither the UK or France would have invaded the Low Countries (the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) so the front would have remained on the French-German border. The German border was also fortified (if not as extensively as its French counterpart). Fighting there would likely  prove a stalemate. This would probably result in political problems for France, which had a notoriously troubled political scene. 

I would assume that the Germans would consolidate their hold on Central Europe and the Baltic together with the USSR (Molotov-Ribbentrop) further expanding their ""Unholy Alliance"". This would be a threat to British-India ... which would cause serious problems for the Allies and might make them want to 'resolve' the conflict by political means.

This means India, Africa and all of East Asia and all the Middle East region.

You might ask yourself why. 

The allied nations never honoured any of their agreements.

A few off my head are the Balfour Declaration where the Arab tribes fought for the allied powers yet were not given what they were promised their homeland.

Again in 1919 when China came to the aid of the Allied powers with 200,000 labourers. Again this was to get Shandong back. This was also not honoured. This led directly to the rise of the communist party. Exactly the same happened after WW2. All non whites who came to England to work in the arms factories were deported at gun point.

India too fought to get independence. They too did not get what they were promised. In WW2 the bastard Churchill even subjected India to a man made famine EVEN THOUGH India provided millions of troops. The Indian contribution is not recognised there is what one memorial to them in England. The UK then subjected India to a partition killing millions more.

Then consider the US. Non whites were not even considered humans until 1965 what with all the unfair literacy tests preventing their franchise. The US is and was a white supremacist nation Jim Crow laws, Chinese exclusion act, internment, the post WW2 mass arrest of Chinese without trial. Look at Jessie Owens about his comments about going to Berlin for the Olympics. He thought FDR treated him worse.





At the very least Africa, India, the Middle East and Asia should have simply let the European powers destroy each other. It wasn't our war it was nothing to do with us. The European powers should have fought it out amongst themselves.




Look at the USA today. Dylan Roof is considered to be a hero. You have a president who took white supremacists off the FBI watch list. You STILL have massive segregation, you still have massive inequality and massive racism against non whites.

Just look at the Vietnam war where rape and murder were completely acceptable. Where the Mai Lai massacre was APPROVED and condoned by the US military. 



Fuck man look at TODAY. Where white people think it's OK to go to Asia be assholes attack people even rape (Okinawa US military has a rape rate of 2400 per 100,000 vs the native rate of 21 per 100,000) and US citizens think it's ok because we're not human apparently.

PointingAtTheGUI,mm,Myanmar,"Then a bid for the work arrived from a Chinese factory.

When an Apple team visited, the Chinese plant’s owners were already constructing a new wing. “This is in case you give us the contract,” the manager said, according to a former Apple executive. The Chinese government had agreed to underwrite costs for numerous industries, and those subsidies had trickled down to the glass-cutting factory. It had a warehouse filled with glass samples available to Apple, free of charge. The owners made engineers available at almost no cost. They had built on-site dormitories so employees would be available 24 hours a day.

The Chinese plant got the job.

“The entire supply chain is in China now,” said another former high-ranking Apple executive. “You need a thousand rubber gaskets? That’s the factory next door. You need a million screws? That factory is a block away. You need that screw made a little bit different? It will take three hours.”

In Foxconn City

An eight-hour drive from that glass factory is a complex, known informally as Foxconn City, where the iPhone is assembled. To Apple executives, Foxconn City was further evidence that China could deliver workers — and diligence — that outpaced their American counterparts.

That’s because nothing like Foxconn City exists in the United States.

The facility has 230,000 employees, many working six days a week, often spending up to 12 hours a day at the plant. Over a quarter of Foxconn’s work force lives in company barracks and many workers earn less than $17 a day. When one Apple executive arrived during a shift change, his car was stuck in a river of employees streaming past. “The scale is unimaginable,” he said.

Foxconn employs nearly 300 guards to direct foot traffic so workers are not crushed in doorway bottlenecks. The facility’s central kitchen cooks an average of three tons of pork and 13 tons of rice a day. While factories are spotless, the air inside nearby teahouses is hazy with the smoke and stench of cigarettes.

Foxconn Technology has dozens of facilities in Asia and Eastern Europe, and in Mexico and Brazil, and it assembles an estimated 40 percent of the world’s consumer electronics for customers like Amazon, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, Nintendo, Nokia, Samsung and Sony.

“They could hire 3,000 people overnight,” said Jennifer Rigoni, who was Apple’s worldwide supply demand manager until 2010, but declined to discuss specifics of her work. “What U.S. plant can find 3,000 people overnight and convince them to live in dorms?”

In mid-2007, after a month of experimentation, Apple’s engineers finally perfected a method for cutting strengthened glass so it could be used in the iPhone’s screen. The first truckloads of cut glass arrived at Foxconn City in the dead of night, according to the former Apple executive. That’s when managers woke thousands of workers, who crawled into their uniforms — white and black shirts for men, red for women — and quickly lined up to assemble, by hand, the phones. Within three months, Apple had sold one million iPhones. Since then, Foxconn has assembled over 200 million more.

Foxconn, in statements, declined to speak about specific clients.

“Any worker recruited by our firm is covered by a clear contract outlining terms and conditions and by Chinese government law that protects their rights,” the company wrote. Foxconn “takes our responsibility to our employees very seriously and we work hard to give our more than one million employees a safe and positive environment.”

The company disputed some details of the former Apple executive’s account, and wrote that a midnight shift, such as the one described, was impossible “because we have strict regulations regarding the working hours of our employees based on their designated shifts, and every employee has computerized timecards that would bar them from working at any facility at a time outside of their approved shift.” The company said that all shifts began at either 7 a.m. or 7 p.m., and that employees receive at least 12 hours’ notice of any schedule changes.

Foxconn employees, in interviews, have challenged those assertions.

Another critical advantage for Apple was that China provided engineers at a scale the United States could not match. Apple’s executives had estimated that about 8,700 industrial engineers were needed to oversee and guide the 200,000 assembly-line workers eventually involved in manufacturing iPhones. The company’s analysts had forecast it would take as long as nine months to find that many qualified engineers in the United States.

In China, it took 15 days.

Companies like Apple “say the challenge in setting up U.S. plants is finding a technical work force,” said Martin Schmidt, associate provost at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In particular, companies say they need engineers with more than high school, but not necessarily a bachelor’s degree. Americans at that skill level are hard to find, executives contend. “They’re good jobs, but the country doesn’t have enough to feed the demand,” Mr. Schmidt said.

Some aspects of the iPhone are uniquely American. The device’s software, for instance, and its innovative marketing campaigns were largely created in the United States. Apple recently built a $500 million data center in North Carolina. Crucial semiconductors inside the iPhone 4 and 4S are manufactured in an Austin, Tex., factory by Samsung, of South Korea.

But even those facilities are not enormous sources of jobs. Apple’s North Carolina center, for instance, has only 100 full-time employees. The Samsung plant has an estimated 2,400 workers.

“If you scale up from selling one million phones to 30 million phones, you don’t really need more programmers,” said Jean-Louis Gassée, who oversaw product development and marketing for Apple until he left in 1990. “All these new companies — Facebook, Google, Twitter — benefit from this. They grow, but they don’t really need to hire much.”

It is hard to estimate how much more it would cost to build iPhones in the United States. However, various academics and manufacturing analysts estimate that because labor is such a small part of technology manufacturing, paying American wages would add up to $65 to each iPhone’s expense. Since Apple’s profits are often hundreds of dollars per phone, building domestically, in theory, would still give the company a healthy reward.

But such calculations are, in many respects, meaningless because building the iPhone in the United States would demand much more than hiring Americans — it would require transforming the national and global economies. Apple executives believe there simply aren’t enough American workers with the skills the company needs or factories with sufficient speed and flexibility. Other companies that work with Apple, like Corning, also say they must go abroad.

Manufacturing glass for the iPhone revived a Corning factory in Kentucky, and today, much of the glass in iPhones is still made there. After the iPhone became a success, Corning received a flood of orders from other companies hoping to imitate Apple’s designs. Its strengthened glass sales have grown to more than $700 million a year, and it has hired or continued employing about 1,000 Americans to support the emerging market.

But as that market has expanded, the bulk of Corning’s strengthened glass manufacturing has occurred at plants in Japan and Taiwan.

“Our customers are in Taiwan, Korea, Japan and China,” said James B. Flaws, Corning’s vice chairman and chief financial officer. “We could make the glass here, and then ship it by boat, but that takes 35 days. Or, we could ship it by air, but that’s 10 times as expensive. So we build our glass factories next door to assembly factories, and those are overseas.”

Corning was founded in America 161 years ago and its headquarters are still in upstate New York. Theoretically, the company could manufacture all its glass domestically. But it would “require a total overhaul in how the industry is structured,” Mr. Flaws said. “The consumer electronics business has become an Asian business. As an American, I worry about that, but there’s nothing I can do to stop it. Asia has become what the U.S. was for the last 40 years.”

Middle-Class Jobs Fade

The first time Eric Saragoza stepped into Apple’s manufacturing plant in Elk Grove, Calif., he felt as if he were entering an engineering wonderland.

It was 1995, and the facility near Sacramento employed more than 1,500 workers. It was a kaleidoscope of robotic arms, conveyor belts ferrying circuit boards and, eventually, candy-colored iMacs in various stages of assembly. Mr. Saragoza, an engineer, quickly moved up the plant’s ranks and joined an elite diagnostic team. His salary climbed to $50,000. He and his wife had three children. They bought a home with a pool.

“It felt like, finally, school was paying off,” he said. “I knew the world needed people who can build things.”

At the same time, however, the electronics industry was changing, and Apple — with products that were declining in popularity — was struggling to remake itself. One focus was improving manufacturing. A few years after Mr. Saragoza started his job, his bosses explained how the California plant stacked up against overseas factories: the cost, excluding the materials, of building a $1,500 computer in Elk Grove was $22 a machine. In Singapore, it was $6. In Taiwan, $4.85. Wages weren’t the major reason for the disparities. Rather it was costs like inventory and how long it took workers to finish a task.

EFTA er et handels-forbund hvor hvert medlem har sin egen nasjonale handelspolitikk og egne tollsatser ovenfor andre land. EFTA land har full suverenitet over nasjonal handelspolitikk.

Vi ser at sentral-Europeiske land utenfor EU har opplevd økonomisk vekst som CEFTA medlemmer, EU medlemskap er ikke den eneste muligheten.

EFTA og EU overlapper hverandre mye, og medlemskap i organisasjonene er av praktiske årsaker gjensidig utelukkende. 

Mitt inntrykk av Engelske aviser er at EFTA er det mest realistiske alternativet for Storbritannia.

Well that was certanily true a couple of years ago but our political climate is getting really shaken up, Jobbik kinda shifted/is shifting to a center-right popular party ( basically they want to become a Fidesz with more nationalism and less corruption ), Fidesz are actually calling them leftists and liberals and some of their more radical supporters are turning against them, and we also have a new player on the block ( Momentum Movement ), who are a really young party mostly led by young people, students and intellectuals, but no one is completely sure about their stances, but I'm pretty optimistic because they seemed pretty rational and centrist from what interviews I've seen.

[Liberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Liberia#Colonization_.281821.E2.80.931847.29)

[Ethiopia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War).

Perhaps your point is that they weren't involved in the 'scramble of Africa'? But then we need to establish what we mean by colonisation here. 

&gt;Personally I'd also view most of the central african countries as non-colonized because the amount of colonization that took place there was really minimal and **did not even touch most of the inhabitants in any way.**

What do you mean by this? Can you give me an example? 

&gt;You can easily make an argument that Britain was far more colonized than any of those countries.


Again we ought to establish the concept of colonisation were using here. Do you view colonisation to be merely equivalent to tribal invasion? or do you see any unique features that tribal invasion would have in order to become a 'colonial project'?

&gt;If you consider colonization to be a spectrum, then out of the sub-saharan African countries, Namibia, South Africa and Kenya would be the most colonized. 

Do you make a distinction between what you mean as 'most colonised' and 'most westernised'?  Where does Leopold's Congo fit in? it was **very** colonised but had little in the way of westernisation. 

Would you agree that  (1) the countries you listed above were the most *westernised* (in the sense that they were structured in a way compatible with the global westernised community) and (2) colonisation doesnt necessarily imply westernisation?



—————

I'm cautious about asserting anything yet, with all these probing questions. But essentially, my response to you is that you seem to be ignoring the uniquely globalised *racialised* nature of eurocolonialism. 

Even if Ethiopia and the territory of Liberia were never 'officially colonised', how do you imagine peoples from those regions would be affected by the global perception of Black/African peoples which were spread by eurocolonialism? Considering how pervasively strong racialised attitudes were (to the point where African was often synonymous with sub-human); I dont think it mattered if they were not individually colonized. Who would they trade with? Their certainly colonised neighboring european colonies?

You say ""Britain was far more colonized"", which is interesting to note. Do you mean has experienced more tribal conflict and invasions or do you have a more specific understanding of colonisation? For me, however, your argument fails to take into account racialisation. Was the territory of Brittain conquered and seen as conquerable *because its inhabitants were of a 'subhuman race'?"" Was this subhuman racial categorization signified and entrenched in the invading and eventually colonised people and society; leaving racialised subclass of natives? These, for me, seem like important differences which impact the likelihood of colonised peoples recovering.

___________


tl;dr: What do you mean/understand when using the term ""colonisation""? how is it separate (if at all) from other forms of tribal conflict and invasion?

Europe's best soccer teams enter the intercontinental UEFA Champion's League's which takes place over a year. UEFA Europa League is set-up for not so great teams that are 2nd tier. 
Losers of Champ league tournament sets fall to Europa to be seeded if they lose in a certain phase.

Meaning, a loser of UEFA Champion's League cannot win that title this year, but has a shot at the Europa league for lesser European teams. While this is pseudo-double elimination, this means a loser cannot be champion of Europe's greatest sports league this year. 

**Why would you want a loser to be champion?** Oh and Europa league winners get to enter Champion's League as a reward next year, regardless of how they placed in the home nation's league. A reward to become champion next year if they keep it up!

You really cannot argue double elimination with 'accurate team placing' as this is total baloney.

dimitrit94,EURO,Senatus Populus Que Europaeus,"I work in the artificial turf industry all over Europe. Norway is the Nordic country that spends the most in artificial turf pitches and fields. They dominate demand for artificial turf in the region which is surprising considering it has less than half the population of Sweden and lower population than Denmark and Finland

A Norwegian client told me this was due to the government wanting to spend in the better distribution of the population within the country, so the territory would be populated all over and not just in the south and main cities. So government invests in leisure infrastructure around the country. 

Can't confirm if this policy is true, but can confirm indeed that Norway has pitches in the most remote places. 

------------------------------

edit -- Expanding on the topic and giving more context for those interested. All these numbers come from different sources and market studies I have carried out for work. 

The drivers for Norway's demand are the harsh climatic conditions, the consequence this has for the availability of sports surfaces -- particularly **football** (looking at *you*, OP)-- and the extraordinary wealth of the Norwegian economy. 

The country was therefore an early investor in artificial pitches and large installations have run at around 100 pitches per year since 2002, plus many indoor stadia and a multitude of smaller installations. 

In 2015 the Norwegian football association installed about 216 football pitches (of which 40% were replacement turf). Much of the investment arises from lottery funding which gives a high subsidy but also stipulates that the pitch must last for 10 years, it does not permit re-funding before that period. 

Thus demand since 2012/13 has started to include replacement of old pitches albeit replacement is at a lower rate than the initial installation rate because lottery funding is now less available and takes a few years to process. 

* In Norway around 50% (which is hell of a lot) of the premier league and almost all of the other leading soccer clubs have chosen artificial turf. 

* Sweden has a slightly lower annual demand for artificial turf, installing perhaps 90-100 pitches per year. 

* Demand in Denmark is relatively small at less than 50 pitches per year, mainly because the country has more favourable climatic conditions. Demand has also been subdued at the top level by negative views but at a community and training level demand has started to show signs of growth. 

* Finland approved the use of artificial turf at the top level of football in 2001 but today only 7 of its top teams choose to play on it. At lower levels of competition it is more widespread, and it finds particular strength in its use in indoor halls which can sometimes be temporary constructions. Interestingly in Finland 20 of the artificial turf pitches are also used for ice skating for part of the year! Demand in Finland is around 30 pitches per year but is expected to grow strongly as the Finnish Football Association has committed to a strong programme of investment in artificial turf pitches.

This is all for artificial grass for sports. The landscape and leisure turf market in Northern Europe is small and underdeveloped.

For me it's more about the size and how you do it though.  Most European cities are about 6 - 8 stories high. Paris, which is one of the most densely populated places on Earth (believe it or not) is probably 8 - 10ish on average, but pretty consistently that height, and that seems to be a good mix between height and density.  With height comes overshadowing and wind tunnels, and I guess I just fear parts of the CBD will become that (it's already happening in Southbank a bit).  Most buildings going up are 15 - 20+ stories, with many that are 50+.

mitsuhiko,,,"&gt; Mit höherem Staatszuschuss funktioniert es auf jeden Fall. Irgendwo muss das Geld halt herkommen, und da gibt es noch viel Spielraum.

Aber ist es wirklich sinnvoll immer mehr Geld in die Pensionen zu stecken? Wo wuerdest du die Grenze ziehen?

&gt; Natürlich ist es eine Kürzung der Leistungen. Du kannst nur argumentieren, dass es eine faire Kürzung der Leistungen ist.

Dann musst du aber auch auf den Zeitraum schauen. 1970 war das effektive Pensionsantrittsalter 65 Jahre fuer Maenner. Heute ist es bei 58.4. 1970 warst du im Schnitt 6 Jahre in der Pension, heute bist du 30 Jahre in Pension. Das war eine nicht geplante Verlaengerung der Pensionsdauer und so nie beabsichtigt. Es gibt Leute die heute in Pension gehen auf dem alten Pensionsmodell die laenger in Pension sein werden als sie gearbeitet haben.

&gt; Also erstens ist deine Behauptung, dass die Pensionen zu großen Teilen von den Zuschüssen getragen werden, Blödsinn. Die Deckungsquote der PVA ist 96,0%, selbst die Agenda Austria spricht von 25%.

Das zitierte Papier spricht von ""Schon
jetzt werden aus dem Bundesbudget knapp zehn Milliarden Euro pro Jahr in das Pensionssystem gepumpt"". Das BMF sagt Zuschuesse 2014 ""10,2 Mrd. Euro"" und 2015 ""10,7 Mrd. Euro"". Wo siehst du die 25% Deckungsquote im verlinkten PDF? Generell helfen aber die PVA Zahlen nicht, weil sie ja nicht die gesamten Pensionen abdecken. ZB braucht die PVA nur 6 Milliarden vom Bund, der erst verteilt sich auf VAEB, SVB und SVA. Zahlen aus dem Budgetbericht des BMF 2016: https://www.bmf.gv.at/budget/das-budget/Budgetbericht_2016.pdf?5te3mr

&gt; Bevor du mit Beamtenpensionen kommst

Habe nie von Beamtenpensionen gesprochen.

&gt; Zweitens: Das System ist nicht ""zu teuer"".

Wie definierst du ""nicht 'zu teuer'""? Weil wenn wir nur nach Eurostat Zahlen gehen schaut das System schon sehr teuer aus (und das ist der *status quo* und keine Projektion): http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/f/fc/Total_annual_pension_expenditure_per_beneficiary_for_old-age_pensions%2C_EU-28%2C_2013_%28in_EUR_and_PPS%29.png

Wir reden hier gar nicht von irgendwas, dass die Agenda Austria da biegen muesste.

&gt; Man müsste nur die Produktivitätssteigerungen genauso zur Zahlung von SV-Beiträgen herbeiziehen wie die Gehälter. Die Agenda Austria ignoriert das in der PDF einfach und behauptet, man könnte nur die Gehälter zu PV-Beiträgen heranziehen.

Wie gesagt, darum geht es hier gar nicht. Hier ging es ausschliesslich um die Entwicklung der Kosten der Pensionen auf Basis des Antrittsalters + Lebenserwartung + PAYG Basis + Mindestbetraege. Wie du das finanzierst ist eine uninteressante Policy Entscheidung und ich hab kein Wort darueber hier gelassen. Es ging ausschliesslich darum, dass unser Pensionssystem aktuell nicht finanzierbar ist und weiter angepasst werden muesste.

&gt;**I have watched so many reviews on the current game and there is just so much to do compared to the start of HoT or really the game before the expansion is there any guide I could follow to getting geared that isnt from years ago or the absolute start of HoT unless it's the same?**

Gear is pretty much either Berserker for power or Viper/Trailblazers for Condi.

There are some other gear sets for other specific roles/things that you can see on metabattle.com though.

&gt;**Is leveling fast in this game still professions or how could I get my other desired classes fast into the endgame without having to straight up buy a instant 80 token?**

You can only get 1 instant 80 token and that is with the initial purchase of HoT. Other than that tomes of knowledge from PvP or WvW are good for leveling. Leveling the normal way (events and such) still give quite a lot of exp but it can be kinda boring.

&gt;**Are there tiers in raiding? Do I need to do a certain amount of fractals or things around that nature to dive into raiding or how does that process work I haven't really found a good guide on how to start gearing and progressing to the raiding section of the game**

With raiding it is mostly just learn the mechanics of the fights. For gear you find a build for raiding on whatever class you want and that determines your role in the raid, use http://metabattle.com for it or http://qtfy.eu/builds/ to find a raid build. Otherwise just learn skill rotations and watch videos to learn mechanics. There are some subreddits for raiding as well but I don't remember exactly what they're called since I don't go to them.

&gt;**Has the process of getting a legendary been changed at all or made easier/harder since the start of the game?**

With the launch of HoT you can ""make"" precursors now using HoT masteries and going through a collection process. There is I think 3 collections for non HoT legendaries and 4 for HoT legendaries. You have to finish collection 1 of a legendary before moving onto the next collection too (which means crafting the item you get a recipe for after completing the collection)

Otherwise the process of making a legendary is the same besides the fact you can craft precursors now instead of RNG/buying them. 

Still takes a bit of time/money to ""craft"" the precursors through the collection ways though.

Some of the new HoT legendary precursors though you just flat out craft them instead of going through the collection process, they changed it to crafting for the newer HoT ones cause otherwise it would take them too long to release new legendaries. The crafting way has made it so they can release a new legendary weapon every living world season 3 episode.

brufleth,,,"I did.  Shit.  Like twenty years ago.  Fuck I'm old.  Most of the shit was based on white males because that was the largest sample.  Most of what I took from it was that intelligence tends to lead to success in pretty much all things ranging from ending up in the ER less to having a more successful career.

In the context of my actual life (having lived a good bit more of it since reading the book) I think many critical things were missed in the book which maybe I just don't remember or have since been addressed.  For example, what even is intelligence?  Are they really just measuring the ability to succeed in our current society?  Naturally, that's going to favor white males because that's what our society fucking favors.  This vaguely overlaps with wealthy upper class families generally having more successful kids who probably will score higher on IQ tests.  Are you really sure you're measuring some inherent intelligence, or are you again just measuring the ability of someone to succeed in our society, because that's again going to favor people from higher classes who are more likely to have better schooling, better home life, better fucking nutrition even, etc.

I remember the book breezing over some of these things, but many people seem to take it as fully accounting for all of this and successful people are just successful because of some inborn intelligence factor.  That's simply not the case and anyone who can so easily believe that success is singularly genetic intelligence issue is just trying to justify their racism.  Hell, one simply has to look at history to see that different groups have succeeded at different times for different reason.  Sometimes it even is a genetic reason, but if the world were ten degrees warmer and malaria was ravaging predominately white latitudes, while dark skinned people (with a higher probability or resistance due to sickle cell) flourished, would people then claim they were smarter?

noahajac,Technician,"Moto X 2014, LineageOS 14.1","The following instructions are for Windows only. Please don't use a virtual machine as these can cause problems communicating with the device. There is an alternative method for Linux or macOS. Just tell me if you aren't on Windows, I can easily change the instructions. A quick tip though, make sure you have Windows set to display all file extensions. This can really help for debugging purposes.

First we need to download the tool that flashes to the devices different partitions. On most devices you use a tool called fastboot, but Samsung devices aren't like most devices (excluding the Galaxy Nexus). This tool is called Odin, it's Windows only and leaked from Samsung so you need to get it from a trusted source. You can download the latest version (as of 5/1/2017) [here](https://build.nethunter.com/samsung-tools/Odin_3.12.3.zip). Extract the ""Odin_3.12.3.zip"" file. You should now have a folder called ""Odin_3.12.3"". Treat this as your working directory and download all other files to this folder. Now we need to download Team Win Recovery Project, or TWRP as most people call it. TWRP is a custom recovery. A recovery is a mini-OS that is stored on another partition of the device that can do basic functions like flashing and wiping. TWRP is one of the more full featured recoveries as it has stuff like backup and restore built in. Devices do have stock recoveries but these are programmed to only flash files signed by the manufacturer, people don't often notice this but stock recovery is what the device uses when you run an OTA (Over The Air) update or a factory reset. You can get the latest version (as of 5/1/2017) of TWRP for your device [here](https://dl.twrp.me/p4noterf/twrp-2.8.7.0-gt-n8013.img.html). Make sure to click ""Download twrp-2.8.7.0-gt-n8013.img"" to download the actual file. They also offer an md5 checksum, which you can use to check if the TWRP file is corrupt or not, but this isn't needed. You also need to run it though [this program](https://build.nethunter.com/samsung-tools/img2tar.zip) to convert it to a format flashable by Odin (put TWRP in the recovery folder). Now we need to download the Android platform tools. These contain multiple tools (including fastboot as I mentioned earlier) but we are after ADB (Android Debug Bridge). It has multiple use cases and can be used in recovery or just in the normal Android system. You can download the latest version (as of 5/1/2017) of the platform tools for Windows [here](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip). Extract the ""platform-tools-latest-windows.zip"" file and there should be a ""platform-tools"" folder. Open this folder and move its contents into the ""Odin_3.12.3"" folder from before. Now to download the part that actually roots your device, SuperSU. It, along with a bunch of other things come in a flashable zip format that gets flashed using a custom recovery. SuperSU has 2 build types, stable or beta. I recommend just using the stable to avoid hiccups. You can get the latest stable version (as of 5/1/2017) [here](https://download.chainfire.eu/1016/SuperSU/UPDATE-SuperSU-v2.79-20161211114519.zip?retrieve_file=1).

Now to prepare the device to be flashed with TWRP. Go into settings and look for ""Developer Options"" or something along those lines. If it isn't there, go into ""About phone"" and tap ""Build number"" 7 times. Then go back up into settings. They should be there now. Enable ""Developer Options"" (if it has a toggle) then enable ""USB Debugging"". This allows us to use ADB on the stock ROM but it usually isn't needed (we enable it just in case). Also enable ""OEM Unlock"" if it's there, this would allow us to flash unsigned images to the device however not all builds have this setting so you may not need to enable it. Also go back into security settings and disable reactivation lock if you can. Because sometimes it can cause issues. Once you have these options set, shutdown the device.

Hold the Volume Down, Home, and Power keys. This should put the device into download mode. Accept any warnings then plug the device in. Open ""Odin.exe"" from the ""Odin_3.12.3"" folder. In the log, it should say `Added!` and have a blue COM thing near the top, meaning it detected your device. If it didn't detect it, then tell me because that means you probably have a driver issue.  Click the ""Option"" tab and make sure ""F. Reset Time"" and ""Auto Reboot"" is enabled. Also check the checkbox next to the ""AP"" button and then click the button. Select the ""twrp-2.8.7.0-gt-n8013.img.tar.md5"" file. Now on the device, hold the Volume Up and Home keys and click ""Start"" in Odin. Normally the key combo to get into recovery is Volume Up, Home, and Power but since Odin is going to auto reboot the device when it finishes flashing we don't need to use the Power button. If it's too hard to click ""Start"" at the same time as holding the buttons. You can just disable ""Auto Reboot"" and click ""Start"". Once Odin says ""RESET"" or ""PASS"" near the top and says it successfully flashed in the log. You can then just hold the Volume Up, Home, and Power keys. Whatever method you choose, keep holding the keys until you see the Team Win Recovery Project (TWRP) splash screen.

It's going to ask you if you want to modify the system, click ""Keep System Read Only"".  It may also ask you anytime during the process if you want to root, don't let it do this. This is when you can backup your stock ROM and data which I suggest you do in case anything messes up. Now to flash SuperSU, click ""Advanced"" and click ""ADB Sideload"". Swipe the slider, you don't need to wait for it to start as it will start once it gets the command from your computer. Open a command prompt Window up to the ""Odin_3.12.3"" folder and run `adb devices`. After the message about starting the daemon you should see something like `&lt;SERIAL NUMBER&gt;    sideload`. If you don't then you may need to configure drivers. There is multiple methods to flash zips with TWRP but this is my favorite as it doesn't leave the files on the device. Now just run `adb sideload UPDATE-SuperSU-v2.79-20161211114519.zip` to flash it. The percentage is inaccurate so don't worry if it goes over 100%. TWRP will say once it finishes. Then you could click ""Reboot System"" and it should boot normally.

You should see a SuperSU app which you can open to configure root. If you have any questions or problems about the procedure, updating, or about SuperSU itself. Feel free to ask me. I'm happy to help.",True,0,1493639217,,False,0,dgzcbdz,t3_67zr77,t1_dgzbqxp,1496163092,2,False,androidroot,t5_2sor1,

Many are descendants of former confederate soldiers and the refusal to admit fault has been passed down generations.

Fiachaire,SPI,Pretty much the devil,"Ceann Comhairle,

A 2014 study found that among the 22 countries classified as 'Western Europe' Ireland has the third highest death rate for children under five. At 4.6/1000, it was twice the rate in Iceland. While I recognize that Western Europe has a much higher standard than much of the world, the infant mortality rate is still widely used as an indicator of a nations health services and sure ours must be judged in a European context. 

While other sources put the rate at 3.7/1000, I presume they are addressing a more narrow age group. Narrower still as they distinguish between the infant deaths in 2014 (249) and the neonatal deaths (184) of infants less than 4 weeks old. While mortality rates in general had seen a decrease, both of these figures were up.

I mention this because while I admire the spirit of the bill it is somewhat soft to say ""Despite the excellent hospital facilities, sometimes, young children may pass away."" Mortality rates are serious and complicated, and when we deal with them we must deal with them with the steady, informed and objective qualities we so admire among our physicians and nurses.

Of course this bill is not about prevention, but about funeral costs. Funeral costs can vary greatly, and usually burial plots are more expensive in large cities. However large cities also dedicate plots for child deaths which reduces cost. It is also uncommon for a hearse to be involved, and, especially among neonatal deaths, a funeral parlor. Furthermore, the state already provides a significant grant to cover funeral costs for medical card holders.

This is why I have trouble supporting the bill. If I were to judge from the data and the intent of the bill, I would suppose we were addressing approximately 300 cases. The €12,000,000 would represent €40,000 per funeral (slightly less when we factor the cost of administration and implementation). 249 cases would change the figure to  €48,192.77. I do admire the concern expressed in the bill, but the reaction is well out of proportion.

A more measured bill with a budget that estimated or adapted to the realities of the situation would be most commendable, as would legislation to improve the infrastructure, services and practices surrounding natal and prenatal care in Ireland.

Perhaps I didn't explain my reasoning well.

The poor voter turn-out for EU elections, in fact the **decreasing** turnout in most countries is a reflection of how poorly the EU has engaged the electorate.

People don't think it matters, they don't feel connected to the process. This seems little different to me from young voters not voting because politicians fail to connect with them as mentioned in the Mirror article. Perhaps I could have specified/differentiated between EU politicians and the EU in general terms. 

I did also want to include the idea of the EU as an institution, which should essentially have been running a PR campaign to promote its goals, history, activities, and achievements something not perhaps within the remit of individual MEPs who would promote their own EU agendas to get elected. 

Thus pro-active politicians aren't the only solution to the EU's malaise although clearly a crucial one.

The second link, I'd seen before.

A part of me feels that Brexiters jumped on the sovereignty angle to legitimise what were really anti-immigration concerns.

That aside, both the sovereignty and immigration arguments have been shown to be false, as far as I know.

The UK needs immigrants. 

The UK Parliament was always sovereign. Some people just didn't want to accept that power-sharing is inherent in being a member of **any** group, whilst conveniently forgetting the power that is derived from acting as a unified bloc, a lesson we're about to learn in devastating fashion once the Brexit negotiations begin in earnest.

What about these reasons?

&gt;Irish businesses have unhindered access to a market of over 510 million people


&gt;An estimated 700,000 jobs have been created in Ireland during the years of membership and trade has increased 90 fold


&gt;Between 1973 and 2014, Ireland received over €72.5 billion from the EU. During the same time, it contributed approximately €30 billion to the EU budget.


&gt;Between 1973 and 2014 Irish farmers received €54 billion from the Common Agricultural Policy.


&gt;Irish citizens have the right to move, work and reside freely within the territory of other member states


In addition, Ireland has received, up until last September, more money from the EU than we've put into it. Considering we've been with them for decades, that's considerable.


AS for the loss of everything else you've mentioned, that is the cause of the global economic crash... You know, the 2008 one? That affected everyone?



AS for everything else you complain about, that isn't the fault of the EU, it's the fault of the Irish government. You know, the one we're giving shit to for over sisters of Charity, the failure to resolve the Bus Eireann dispute, the lack of hospital beds? All Irish government failures.


But let's be real. Do you really expect them to continuously run a service that is producing a loss, when we're already have a deficit to even?

I never said Ireland didn't have our problems. But we are far from as bad as you make it out to be. Even more so, my comment was in response to your shitting on the EU.

allusiondoge,,,"Eu tenho os ATH-M50x e são bastante bons, comprei por 150 no ebay de um vendedor ingles. O meu irmão tem uns hyperx cloud2, comprou por 70 euros na worten. 

O que dizem dos athm50x em fóruns e sites estrangeiros é dividido 50/50 entre pessoal a dizer que são literalmente a melhor compra pelo preço e pessoal a dizer que só têm nome e que há muito melhor por isso não sei. Também vejo muito pessoal a dizer bem dos beyerdynamics 770 e dos sennheiser hd598. Se comprares os ATH-M50x fala comigo por pm para te dar umas dicas porque eles quando saem da caixa têm um pequeno problema que é apertam imenso a cabeça e deixam-te tonto, fazem-no para dar um grau de isolamento aos headphones mas é horrível. Eu tenho os meus há meio ano para aí e não magoam absolutamente NADA desde a primeira semana, e eu uso-os todos os dias várias horas por dia e uso óculos. Já sabes, se os comprares fala comigo que eu dou-te umas dicas. Afasta-te de tudo com o nome Bose a não ser que queiras os noise cancelling, nesse caso à vontade mas fora disso mantém a distância. 

Se quiseres earbuds compra os MX170 da sennheiser por 7 euros ou as earbuds da apple que arranjas por 20 em promoção. Já comprei bastantes earbuds e normalmente por este preço saem uma merda, ouves whistling no fundo e a qualidade é horrível. Tive experiências particularmente horríveis com JBL mas deve ser só daquele modelo em específico, espero eu. Os da apple têm bastante bass que é isso que o povo gosta, não gosto dos produtos da apple porque acho que em geral são um roubo mas os earbuds valem a pena. É pena não me assentarem na orelha senão até usava uns. Não vale a pena comprares earbuds de 50 e 100 euros porque simplesmente soam ao mesmo que uns de 10 ou 20 euros se escolheres bem o modelo, isto é claro se estivermos a falar de earbuds normais. Se começas a falar de bluetooth ou outras funcionalidades os preços aumentam (dizem muito bem dos jaybird). O meu pai tem uns da bose de 100 euros e soam iguais aos meus sennheiser de 7 euros. Têm um auricular que prende melhor para fazer desporto e um microfone, mas isso valerá mesmo 90 euros a mais?

Em relação aos headsets de gaming, a minha opinião é que é tudo lixo excepto os cloud2. Se fores a uma worten ou assim e experimentares os headsets que eles têm lá expostos até te cai o queixo com quão horrível alguns são, especialmente depois de usares uns headphones em condições durante tanto tempo. Razer e steelseries em particular são merda. As criancinhas muito adoram razer e não percebo o porquê, basta pegares na porcaria do headset que vez que aquilo é feito de plástico e guincha quando o tentas dobrar. E nem vou falar da qualidade de som. Steelseries siberia é a mesma merda. Em geral e fora umas excepções todos os headsets de gaming são a mesma merda foda-se, não percebo porque é que o pessoal paga 100 euros por o equivalente a um conjunto headphones de 20 euros+ microfone de 3 euros do chines e 80 euros de maketing.

Se quiseres podes comprar os hyperx cloud2, esses são bons. O microfone não é horrível e a qualidade de construção é excelente, melhor que os meus ATH-M50x sem dúvida. A qualidade de audio não é tão boa como os meus, diria que se os meus forem 10/10 (como nunca experimentei headphones melhores, para já estes são o meu 10 porque foi o melhor que experimentei, não quer dizer que não haja melhor ou que não sejam um 2/10 para outras pessoas) os cloud2 do meu irmão são 7/10. O microfone é removível e aquilo vem com uma merda qualquer de 7.1 sorround aka marketing 7.1 if you ask me. Diria que por metade do preço, uns headphones com ~70% da qualidade de som dos m50x, melhor construção, super confortáveis e com o microfone incorporado (removível) o que os torna mais práticos para dar uns tiros no cs vale sem dúvida a pena. Isto é, se a qualidade de audio não for absolutamente fundamental para ti, nesse caso podes pagar mais 70 euros por mais 30% de qualidade. É sempre assim, chega a um ponto na tecnologia em que para melhorar um bocadinho de nada a performance tens de pagar muito mais.

Zenon_Czosnek,,,"Jeśli mogę się podwiązać tutaj, to chciałbym tu podzielić się swoim doświadczeniem, które mogłoby powyższe ustawić w pewnym kontekście. Zaznaczam od razu, że ani się chwalę, ani żalę, ani dissuję OP, myślę, że to jest ciekawe AMA, bo takie busiki każdy widzi na drogach a nie wiemy jak wygląda tak naprawdę praca takiego kierowcy. 

Ja jednak chciałem napisać o tym, że kiedyś wygladała inaczej. Mam nadzieję, że OP się nie obrazi, że nie robię osobnego AMA, ale też nie mam na to czasu. Natomiast chciałem dać pewien obraz sytuacji aby uzmysłowić jak wygląda nasza rola w transporcie europejskim - dlatego jeśli nie chce Ci się czytać wszystkiego, proponuję przescrollować od razu na dół. 

Tak więc: ok dekady temu, zanim rynek brytyjski został zarżnięty przez konkurencję cenową firm takich, jak ta, w której pracuje OP, pracowałem jako kierowca europejskiego busa dla firmy brytyjskiej. Warunki mieliśmy diametralnie inne. 

Pracowałem w małej firmie, do której ekstremalnie trudno było się dostać. Praktycznie wszyscy, to była rodzina lub znajomi. Ja im kiedyś złożyłem CV tak na pałę, zadzwonili do mnie kiedy na gwałt potrzebowali jakiegoś kierowcy proponujac tymczasową robotę na dwa tygodnie. W ciągu tych dwóch tygodni akurat jeden kierowca został zwolniony (za szpiegowanie dla konkurencji) a że ja akurat już byłem na miejscu to zostałem. 

Firma miała kilkanaście busów, głównie sprinterów blaszanek, ale były też z zabudową kontenerową czy firanką. 

Praca była głównie na telefon. Owszem, byli kierowcy którzy robili jakieś regularne godziny (stałe kursy czy lokalne ""ogony"", ale my, ""europejczycy"" musieliśmy być pod telefonem 24/7. Kiedy się pojawiał kurs, dzwonił telefon z propozycją. Jesli miało się coś w planach, można było odmówić, nie było z tego powodu żadnych konsekswencji (oczywiście nikt nie odmawiał za każdym razem, ale w granicach zdrowego rozsądku to nie było żadnym problemem). Kursy odbywały się na zasadzie ""tam i z powrotem"". To znaczy: jechało się z ekspresem do punktu docelowego, tam rozładunek i czas na odpoczynek, jak się człowiek wyspał, to dzwonił, że już jest gotowy do jazdy i organizowano ładunek powrotny. Jeśli ładunku powrotnego nie było, to sporadycznie trzeba było gdzies po niego podjechać, przeważnie jednak wracało się na pusto (jeśli było blisko - Francja, Benelux itp) albo czekało do skutku, jeśli było się daleko (Skandynawia, Włochy, Europa Wschodnia). 

Firma wykonywała zlecenia dla największych spedycji (TNT, DHL itd) ale utrzymywała się głównie z własnych klientów którzy bezpośrednio zlecali jej robotę. Były to głównie duże firmy z branż IT, lotnictwa, telekomunikacji czy specjalistycznej inżynierii. Ładunki powrotne brano od sieci współpracujących małych firm w całej europie, ostatecznie z giełdy. 

Kierowcy nie mieli własnych samochodów. Firma miała flotę własnych pojazdów, dodatkowo w razie potrzeb wynajmowała długoterminowo dodatkowe, jeśli był bardziej zajęty okres. Poza kilkoma, które trafiły się przypadkiem (np. w rozliczeniu ze zbankrutowanym partnerem biznesowym dostaliśmy Iveco Daily w ""polskiej"" konfiguracji - z sypialką kurnikiem i plandeką), były to wszystkie co do jednego Mercedesy Sprintery nie starsze niż trzy lata. Jeździły w firmie tylko do końca gwarancji, potem były sprzedawane - nierzadko z przebiegami w okolicach 400 000 mil. 

Auta jeździły niemalże na okrągło. Kierowca wracał do bazy, odwieszał kluczyk na kołek, za chwilę przyjeżdzał inny kierowca, brał pierwsze kluczyki z brzegu i jechał. Czasem auta praktycznie nie stygły. 

Wyposażenie było standardowe - najprostsze sprintery, z luksusów mieliśmy tempomat. Nie było klimy, nie było ogrzeawania postojowego, łóżka, nic. 

Nie było to potrzebne, ponieważ (przynajmniej w założeniu) w autach nie spaliśmy. Plan był taki, że jechało się aby dostaarczyć towar jak najszybciej, z ewentualną kilkugodzinną drzemką na siedzeniach, a na miejscu po rozładunku kierowca lokowany był w hotelu gdzie wypoczywał przed kolejnym ""strzałem"". 

Nikt nie pilnował norm spalania, prędkości i tak dalej. Priorytetem było szybkie dostarczenie towaru a nie oszczędność paliwa, nie było więc niczym dziwnym jeżdżenie po 150 km/h po niemieckich autobahnach. Kierowca miał ze sobą trzy karty paliwowe do różnych sieci, żeby nie marnować czasu na szukanie stacji na której może zatankować. 

W aucie nie było telefonu. Część kierowców miała dodatkowe ""służbowe"" komórki na kartę, za doładowania płaciła firma. Ja i kilku kolegów dogadaliśmy się inaczej i korzystaliśmy w pracy z własnych telefonów komórkowych, umówiwszy się tak, że my płacimy za wszystkie telefony krajowe (także jeśli dzwonimy ""służbowo"") a firma za roaming (także, jeśli dzwonimy ""prywatnie""). Nikt nie pytał o nic, nie było ""norm"" użytkowania telefonu ani nic. 

Poza jednym facetem w biurze, ktory kiedyś sam był kierowcą i w ten sposób poprawiał sobie ego (ale można go było ignorować), nikt nie cisnął. Kierowca miał ostatnie zdanie - jesli kierowca mówił, że jest zmęczony i musi się zatrzymać to nie było dyskusji, biuro pytało tylko, czy szukać mu hotelu. Jednym z ulubionych powiedzeń szefa było ""lepiej za późno w tym życiu niż za wcześnie w następnym"". Jako że auto było oczywiście na brytyjskich blachach, służby mundurowe w innych krajach podchodziły bardzo relaksacyjnie (raz nawet niemiecka Polizei mnie puściła dalej choć okazało się, że zapomniałem dokumentów). Do kontroli zatrzymywany byłem sporadycznie (dla porównania raz jechałem polskim busem z Hanoveru do Polski i zatrzymano mnie po drodze trzy razy - tu przez ok 5 lat latania po całej Europie zatrzymany byłem do kontroli może z 15 razy (nie licząc Włoch, bo to inna bajka, tam jakiś Michael Jackson w mundurku ociekającym złotymi epoletami czaił się za każdym krzakiem, ale że zwykle nie mówili po angielsku to mruczeli trochę udając waznych i kazali zwykle jechać dalej). 

Auta były często poobijane. Firma się nie przejmowała tym, mówiła, że ""w tej branży to normalne"". Jakieś drobne obcierki nawet nie były rejestrowane, nie mówiąc o dochodzeniu swojego z ubezpieczenia sprawcy czy od kierowcy, bo szkoda było na to czasu. 

Zarobki były bardzo dobre: kierowcy mieli płacone stała stawkę ok. 8 funtów za godzinę i to od momentu wyjazdu z bazy do momentu powrotu. Płacony był cały czas przebywania poza domem - czas jazdy, czas odpoczynku, czas oczekiwania, czas załadunku, innymi słowy, ""czy się stoi, czy się leży, 8 na godzinę się należy"". Był od tego jeden wyjątek: jeśli kierowca zgłaszał chęć noclegu w hotelu, firma rezerwowała mu pokój i ""zbijała"" z bieżącej doby 8 godzin. Jednak było to dla nich upierdliwe, dlatego niepisaną umową było, ze kierowca po prostu sobie sam znajdował nocleg i płacił tak jakby ""ze swojej kieszeni"". Co przy fakcie, że przez 8 godzin spania zarabiał 64 funty a nocleg w tanim przydrożnym hotelu można było znaleźć już za 25 euro nie był żadnym problemem. 

Ja bardzo nie lubiłem szlajać się po hotelach, dlatego woziłem ze sobą śpiwór i karimatę i często po prostu znajdowałem sobie jakieś ustronne miejsce na łonie przyrody i rozkładałem sobie mały kemping ""na pace"". 

NIe woziliśmy ze sobą żadnych kuchenek ani wałówki, zarobki pozwalały na to, żeby po prostu jadać w przydrożnych restaruacjach. Policznmy: taki kurs do Norwegii na przykład: ok. 3 dni jazdy, półtora dnia odpoczynku i oczekiwania na ładunek powrotny, 3 dni z powrotem, wychodziło jakieś 180 godzin, na rękę było to grubo ponad 1000 funtów za tydzień w pracy. Oczywiście takie kursy nie zdarzały się codziennie, ale miało się dużo czasu dla siebie. Kiedyś wyliczyłem sobie średnią, wyszło mi na to, że w tygodniu przebywałem poza domem średnio 3.5 dnia, a na rękę do domu przynosiłem tygodniowo średnio nieco ponad 500 funtów.

OgataiKhan,,The only 'fair' is laissez-faire,"&gt; So all those people currently relying on disability payments or state pensions just.... Go climb chimneys?

Pensions should be privatised and charity should be voluntary, not forced. The Americans, who have less welfare than Europeans, are more charitable. That's how it should work, not by taking our money under threat of force.

Besides, you are forgetting that most people with disability are not vegetables and it's offensive to think they are: people with disabilities can be very good at performing non-physical jobs.

&gt; funnily enough those things because they are the two things that'd stop the proles coming to ""redistribute"" your own wealth

Good thing that the free market has a proven historical record of generating wealth, contrary to socialism, which tends to cause starvation pretty often.

yoshi570,IDF,Composteur aguerri d’Île-de-France,"&gt; Je note que tu es désormais un fervent défenseur de la liberté d'expression et que tu fais un appel à une rationalité apaisée : il y a peu, sur un mouvement que je faisais, similaire, tu m'avais rétorqué : ""C'est beau la dédiabolisation"" ou ""Tout l'arsenal du fasciste est là"".

Tu noteras qu'il n'y a aucune contradiction entre les deux. Tu noteras aussi que j'ai parlé de liberté de penser, et jamais la liberté d'expression. Tu es donc encore une fois dans le strawman, à m'inventer des propos. Nous ne sommes pas libre de *dire* ce que l'on veut, par contre nous somes libre de *penser* ce que l'on veut. 

Tu n'arrives toujours pas à faire la différence et apparament cela entraine une confusion chez toi: tu as donc l'impression que je défendrais le FN, disant ""mais ils ne pensent pas X, puisqu'ils ne disent pas X"". Hors, je n'ai jamais dit cela. J'indique très clairement autre chose: on ne peut les condamner pour X s'ils ne disent pas X. Leurs intentions réelles, on doit principalement les comprendre en lisant entre les lignes d'un programme volontairement flou. Cependant, il n'existe que peu de marge quant à l'établissement de la pensée réelle frontiste, tu trouveras suffisamment de preuves d'intentions et d'opinions à ce sujet dans leurs discours et dérapages.

&gt;Je réfute les arguments simplistes pour attaquer le FN et c'est pourquoi, dans notre échange passé, je défendais la mesure et toi le fanatisme républicain (tu ne seras pas d'accord, je sais). Désormais que j'avance que ceux qui parle d'""ennemi de la République"" devraient tenter de le faire interdire via des moyens légaux, je suis simpliste. Dans notre échange précédent, je défendais la liberté d'expression démocratique par un vote libre en te demande d'arrêter de fustiger ceux qui voteraient blanc ou s'abstiendraient : tu estimais que dans des circonstances si urgentes et si graves, on ne devait tergiverser sur rien et tout faire ""contre"". Bon. Tu nieras, surement.

Voire plus haut. Je réfute tout autant les arguments simplistes. Je ne suis en effet pas d'accord avec l'idée que défendre la République est du ""fanatisme républicain"". On rejoint ce que je dis auparavant: tu confonds ma position avec la position de la République. Ce n'est pas moi qui dis qu'il faut autoriser le FN, qu'il est nécessaire ou je sais pas quoi. C'est la réalité qu'on ne peut faire un procès basé sur des intentions. Au mieux, que pourrait-on mettre dans l'accusation ? Les dérapages sus-mentionnés ? Rien de plus à balayer comme étant de simples dérapages. Le pire que risquerait le FN c'est d'être forcé de renvoyer un membre du parti.

Quand tu dis que j'aurais prétendu qu'il faut faire ""tout contre"", j'aimerais que tu me montres où j'ai parlé d'aller contre les lois de la République. Ces lois ne permettent pas actuellement de bannir le FN, même si on le souhaitait (et pour ma part j'ai expliqué pourquoi je ne le souhaite pas, contrôler ce qui est dans les ombres au lieu de la place publique est cent fois plus difficile), on ne pourrait pas le faire.

&gt;Si c'est un ennemi de la République (ce que tu penses, tu me l'as écrit), alors la Constitution invite à l'expulser du débat républicain ; si ce n'est pas tenté, c'est effectivement qu'il y a un flou juridique mais aussi un manque de volontés politiques qui lui bénéficient. Tu le sais, je l'ai déjà dit, je suis pour une lutte sans merci contre les idées, toute l'année, sur le terrain, et le respect de la liberté dans le cadre de la loi, notamment pour les citoyens qui vont bientôt voter. Je suis donc, finalement, ravi, que tu mettes en avant l'idée que rien n'est aussi simple que de s'insurger à coup de postures faciles et que nos valeurs fondamentales - liberté en premier lieu - doivent être garanties, y compris pour nos adversaires.

Déjà, non la Constitution n'écrit pas ""expulsons les ennemis de la République"", merci de ne pas juste inventer des propos (non seulement à moi mais aussi) à la Constitution. De plus, ce n'est pas aussi simple que tu le dis pour tous les arguments déjà évoqués. Et ce n'est même pas un flou juridique, c'est une distinction parfaitement normale et saine d'avoir dans la République: on ne peut et ne doit interdire de penser librement. Il n'y aucune posture facile dans dénoncer l'abstention face au FN, au passage. C'est au contraire une posture difficile, car le contre-argument pour le coup très facile est ""mais j'en ai le droit"". De plus, combattre l'abstention n'est pas facile car il faut convaincre, et donc développer des trésors d'arguments de et de persuasion, alors que ne pas changer d'avis ne demande rien d'autre que de répondre ""ok mais je suis pas convaincu"" (je l'ai vécu sur ce sub plusieurs fois, des gens qui une fois que leurs inquiétudes sont rassurées, concluent avec ce que je viens de dire).

Maintenant que l'on soit clairs sur une chose: dénoncer l'abstention ce n'est pas dire qu'il devrait être interdit de s'abstenir. Ca, c'est quelque chose que je souhaiterais, mais qui n'est pas loi. Donc pas la peine non plus d'essayer cet angle là, je n'ai jamais prétendu que c'était illégal.

&gt;je pense qu'on doit arrêter d'appeler le FN ennemi de la République entre deux tours d'élection dans le seul but de faire culpabiliser des électeurs,

Sérieusement, t'es lourd. Et c'est le mot gentil que j'ai en stock. Dire que le FN est l'ennemi de la République n'est pas une manipulation pour faire culpabiliser les électeurs: **c'est la réalité**. Je m'en fous que ça te fasse culpabiliser ou non. Tu le comprends ça ?

&gt;qu'on doit laisser tranquilles et voter en pleine conscience, sans pression, sans grands discours d'opportunité basés sur des caricatures

Je vois pas pourquoi on devrait supprimer le débat publique. Que je sache, personne ne vient chez toi te forcer à lire le sub et/ou participer au débat publique, les électeurs sotn donc ""laisser tranquilles"". De plus, je rejette encore une fois cette tentative de faire passer ce qui ne te plait pas pour une caricature.

&gt;je pense également qu'on a un matériel juridique à disposition pour lutter contre les idées du FN et que la liberté d'expression, notamment politique, n'est pas du tout absolue, contrairement à la liberté de conscience ; je préconise donc - comme dans le précédent échange que nous avions eu - de lutter contre les idées du FN, et non pas contre les gens qui votent FN ou ne voteraient pas suffisamment ""contre"" lui : lutter contre les idées du FN, c'est faire de la pédagogie, montrer l'exemple et faire valoir nos valeurs sur le plan juridique. Lutter contre le FN, à mon sens, c'est aussi dire aux hommes politiques d'arrêter de jouer aux cons avec les idées nauséabondes, ce qui banalise et normalise l'existence d'un parti aux idées pleines de relents xénophobes.

Oui tu peux aller upvoter [tout cela que j'ai déjà écrit là bas](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/67uf8w/le_responsable_de_la_mont%C3%A9e_du_fn_cest/).

&gt; Lutter contre le FN, c'est donc aussi, à mon avis, rappeler que les partis politiques se servent généralement du FN comme d'un repoussoir électoral tout en piochant parfois dans leurs fonds idéologiques : le FN est utilisé par les autres dans un but précis, autant que l'UMP utilise l'UDI ou que le PS utilise EELV - il ne s'agit en rien de complotisme, ne surinterprètes pas ma critique !

Tu retirerais ce ""généralement"" par ""parfois"" et ça aurait un sens. Donc si, c'est bien du complotisme. Tu arrives dans le même post à dénoncer les caricatures et à tomber dans la caricature grasse: tu es dans le procès d'intention. C'est comme si tu me disais que je combats le FN parce que je suis noir, parce que ça sert ma petite personne. Que en fait tous ceux qui combattent le FN le font parce que ça les arrange bien, ils ne le font pas parce que le FN représente un danger pour le bien commun selon eux. C'est ça un procès d'intention, juger les intentions au lieu de juger les actes.

&gt;Si je voulais être vraiment provocateur, je te dirais - pour te montrer que c'est un peu facile ! - que la surinterprétation est également un des outils favoris des conspirationnistes : tu es donc un reptilien ou un conspirationniste. Notamment quand on regarde le nombre de ""s"", très présents dans tes écrits !

TheGreasyPole,redpill,Red Pill Husband,"&gt;As I said in my post, I agree with you that in practice the number of women and men whose careers take the bullet in order to have kids are never going to be the same. But they could be much more equal.

They could be. But what if women actually *don't want them to be more equal*.

What if women *actually prefer* to look after the kids.

What if they have an inbuilt genetic predisposition that makes them more likely to prefer that choice, than to be the breadwinner.

THATS the problem. We've got pretty good scientific reasons to believe thats actually the case... the women feel better/enjoy life more/have higher QoL (on average) being the homemaker than men do.

If thats the case... Then feminists trying to bend the law/society to get more women into work are actually *making more women unhappy, unnecessarily*... And whaddya know ? Since the feminist revolution thats exactly what women report. LOWER happiness levels.

&gt;Interestingly, studies were done into why men in the uk don't tend to take advantage of the shared parental leave, and whilst women wanting the leave was a factor, the workplace making it difficult for them, lack of awareness they could take leave, and fear it would disproportionately affect their earnings were also huge factors. 

And why wern't men making themselves aware ? And why wern't *women* fearing the wage loss ? 

You're missing the causal factor here.... Men are pre-wired to have a greater interest in higher wages than women are, genetically, because in the evolutionary past guys ""wired that way"" had an advantage over males who wern't. Just as women ""wired"" to want to look after kids more than males did had an advantage over females not wired that way.

Thats the point.

Forcing the humans to go against that wiring (rather than allowing them the *choice* to) is going to make them unhappy.

&gt;Internationally, when leave wasn't being split between parents, studies in other European countries showed more men taking paternity leave, even equal leave to women. Now, I'm only a equalitarian rather than a feminist, but surely that sounds fairer to everyone? Reduces the 'pay gap' and offers fairer circumstances to men too, who otherwise, as you say, let the mother's stronger nesting instinct take all the shared leave.

Well, yeah... If it's just ""free money"" I'm not surprised both men and women took as much ""full pay leave"" as they were allowed to. Shit, forget about paternity/maternity leave... If my company offered me 8 weeks paid leave per year instead of 5 weeks, I'd take 8 weeks too. It's ""free money"".

I've got nothing against that either.

But the interesting thing about the UK law was how it forced the couple to make a trade off... and how when they did so people revealed their innate preferences ... men surrendering the family time for higher wages.... and women surrendering the higher wages for more family time.

If those preferences are persistent (and they seem to be) it would explain a whole lot of the gender pay gap. A very great chunk of the difference between the 25% and 2% figure in OP.

&gt;To be honest, I do agree that using the 100:75 pay gap is pretty misleading and not that useful unless specifically talking about child care issues, and whilst I know there still are issues regarding actual equal pay for the same job despite equality laws (have actually experienced and reported this myself!) this use of the pay gap statistics aren't very helpful for that. However, I get why feminists use it.

So do I.... For the same reason Republicans use the ""after 100 days unemployment under Obama was 9%"" statistic to defend Trump.

It suits their case, and *they don't care about how misleading it is* because they're interested in getting their own way and are prepared to mislead as much as they need to in order to do it.",True,0,1493645919,,False,0,dgzfwxo,t3_68har2,t1_dgz6hu7,1496164829,4,False,PurplePillDebate,t5_2ya42,

The crew right now is invite only so send me a Reddit PM if you are interested. Please do not apply in game without sending me a message with your in game name, we wont have any idea who you are, and we get a lot of random applications. If you think you can do ~667k, want a home to race in and can be active on Discord, give me a message and apply in game! Looking forward having you in the family!

- Repito solo hay una excepción en la historia económica mundial y por circunstancias especiales.
- Nunca ha colapsado una economía por subir demasiado los salarios, si por lo contrario: bajarlos, y en el caso Marroquí, al disponer de moneda propia cualquier exceso, de darse el caso, se amortiguaría con la tasa de cambio, y como es mucho mas importante para el bienestar de la población (la economía es la ciencia que se encarga de estudiar como satisfacer las necesidades HUMANAS) el consumo interno, en casi todas las economías, que su subida salarial no les haga mas baratos los productos y servicios importados en proporción a su sueldo, no es mala cosa sino todo lo contrario porque incentiva la sustitución de importaciones.

- El problema del debate político económico son las falsas equivalencias 

- ¿Soluciona el desempleo subir salarios y bajar jornadas repartiendo el trabajo?: Si, 

-¿Crea otros problemillas económicos menores aplicar una medida (cualquiera) de reajuste económico, y no iba a ser menos esta?: Si 

- ¿Como vive mejor la gran mayoría de la gente, con paro o sin paro en su economía? ¿Hay menos suicidios? ¿Hay mas felicidad? :Si

- ¿Aumenta la felicidad al subirse los sueldos, aunque se diese el caso de una devaluación de la moneda? : Si
 
- ¿Disminuye la felicidad al bajarse los sueldos, aunque se revalorice la moneda?: Si

- Pues todo lo demás son zarandajas (dicho en el sentido de cosas poco importantes, o ""flecos"") que poco importan a la población en general, y a la mayoría de negocios y poco le influyen, y que los técnicos del ministerio (y/o del IBEX35)  lidiarán con ellos como buenamente puedan, y por mal que lo hagan, gentes con trabajo, sin paro (capacidad de ir cambiando de trabajo, que es muy importante), y con salarios mas altos y jornadas mas cortas serán mas felices, y además el PIB subirá.

- ¿A que la morosidad baja con subidas salariales?

- ¿A que los costes financieros de las empresas y particulares bajan en proporción? , por cierto mecanismo, el de la inflación, que ayudaba mucho a pagar las hipotecas, y que no se está dando en los últimos 10 años causando buena parte del problema, así que bendita inflación si se da, y se reparte bien (mayor inflación salarial que de precios) a lo que ayudará poder comprar por internet en la UE muchos artículos si los empresarios españoles quieren pasarse de listos con los precios (mecanismo anti inflacionario con el que la propuesta también cuenta)

- En resumen, que tal numerito (indicador económico)  puede empeorar: Si ¿Es peor, para los ciudadanos, (la economía y el PIB) que el paro que hay? : No

- Último pero no menos importante: Ayuda a cumplir con los derechos humanos de los arts 23,y 25 relacionados con el 28 y el 30: Si ¿Viola la actual legislación y política económica estos artículos?: Si

- A las mentiras ultra derechistas económicas (neo o socio liberales) se les combate con EJEMPLOS, (la econometría en términos científicos, que no es muy divulgable si no se traduce a EJEMPLOS) pues sus think tanks les han provisto de muy buenos argumentarios y sobre todo muy repetidos por falsos que sean, a pesar de que el debate académico lo tienen perdido, pues CERO de sus teorías han sido refrendadas ni por ejemplos ni por modelo econométrico alguno jamás. Ni lo serán. Pero eso a la ciudadanía no llega ni llegará mientras controlen los medios de ¿propaganda? porque eso es lo que son al comunicar mentiras.

- Así los casos alemán danés u holandés, hechos además (  a regañadientes sabiendo que lo que funciona no es lo que su ideología dice que funciona -bajar sueldos - sino todo lo contrario) por gobiernos de derechas con jornadas sobre un 20% menores, (y por eso sobre un 20% menos de paro con similares horas de trabajo por activo) y sueldos por hora de mas del doble (mira si hay colchón que no hace mucho menos del 75% de la media europea se consideraba no convergente y mi propuesta subiría de menos del 50% del SM/h alemán a menos de 2/3 (66.66%) lejos aun del 75% para dejar colchón para posteriores subidas y que ese crecimiento del PIB muy por encima del 3% genere una segunda oleada de creación de empleo, al ser este muy superior al 25% que se solucionaría en principio con la medida de choque) son suficiente argumento para convencer al mas facha de todos (recuerdo estar comentándolo en Madrid en un restaurante de cocido madrileño cercano a la Gran Via decorado con motivos franquistas, (era el momento griego) y su dueño preguntarme que lo repitiese formulado de la siguiente manera, ... nos dicen los alemanes que somos vagos , por el paro y ellos trabajan de media un 20% menos por jornada y cobran mas del doble por hora, y por eso tienen menos paro ...,  creo que se lo anotó para hacerse el interesante con sus clientes, mira lo fácil que llega a todo el mundo.).",True,0,1493647866,,1493650040,0,dgzh8un,t3_688lfa,t1_dgy1f18,1496165476,1,False,podemos,t5_31h78,

theredcebuano,hero,Long Live the Eternal Science of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism!,"You mean socialist society. Socialism includes a state ruled by the workers, which has a planned economy and has the goal of transitioning to communism. 

Now, to what you said that most socialist societies have failed due to that, it's actually a misunderstanding of their situation back then. In fact, when Burkina Faso became socialist under Thomas Sankara, their food production tripled due to correct policies which included land reform. 

You have to take in both the external factors and the internal factors. External including weather, arable land, etc. Internal including policy and productive forces. 

When it came to Stalin's Soviet Union, they experienced a famine due to the fact that Stalin focused a little bit too much on industry while forcing collectivization on the peasants. What he wanted to do wasn't wrong - he wanted to modernize agriculture but the way he did it and when he did it was bad. These peasants hoped that in the revolution they'd get their own plot of land, which they received during land reform. However, Stalin wanted to increase their production to stir industry into action and so he collectivized the land which went against what the peasants wanted. What he should've done was take it slowly. Although I think he was forced into doing so because the threat of invasion from the capitalist countries was high. Couple this with the fact that weather in Northern Europe tends to be pretty cold and you get the famines in the early S.U. Interestingly though, they achieved food sufficiency after two five year plans. 

Mao committed a similar mistake during the Great Leap Forward but to a much larger extent. He really focused on industry when he should've focused on developing agriculture patiently with the masses. Add this to the fact that some regions were already experiencing famine, and you get China's last ever famine - the GLF Famine. After that, they never had any more famines. 

This teaches us a lot of things, mainly in the importance of agriculture and its relation with industry. Those things above aren't inherent within the socialist system. They come from a specific historical background and we ought to learn many things from them. 

However, the socialist system with its planned allocation of resources easily achieved food-sufficiency in many countries. Some had to learn it the hard way like Cuba and North Korea when the S.U. collapsed (I mean, I wouldn't call Cuba and North Korea socialist but they have planned economies so that counts) and some were able to slip through it like Burkina Faso. People got what they needed, production in food was raised when it was needed, lowered when it was needed. And constant modernization of agriculture helped this. 

But not so in the capitalist system which, through its highest stage imperialism, constantly forces other countries to experience almost perpetual famines due to the fact that these resources are not allocated to those who need them but those who make profit out of them. 

So to answer this question: 

&gt; is it the fault of the communist system, when the people are starving, or is it other events in play that cause it?

Assuming a relatively decent modern PSU (which the one in the picture likely is not), we have at least 80% efficiency and an active PFC, putting the power factor easily above 95%. Now, the monitor output is rated for 1 A - plenty for most CRTs of the era, giving us 9 amps to feed to the computer. So... S = VI = 9 A * 230 V = 2070 VA, P_in = S*cos(phi) = 2070 VA * 0.95 = 1966 W, P_out = P_in * eta = 1573 W. So, unless you are trying to run something like 7 gamers 1 CPU on that, that is plenty. And any PCs of the era when those were common will be far less hungry than that.

Now, if you are on a wimpy American 115 V mains, that changes a lot. Chances are that for a large screen, even the 1A for the monitor will be cutting it close.

ApollonasX,MAKE,"Macedonia,Hellas"," From referrences of ancient authors, among which Artistofanis, Athinaeos and others, we do know that dishes like stuffed vegetables (like courgettes) and vine leafs with smashed wheat grains (rice came to Europe later) were ancient greek. We also know that ancient Atheneans made yogurt (as easily as they made cheese) and mixed it with spices and garlic or onion. 
The Bysantines inherited all these recipes and improved them, that is, made them more complicated, while Turks went on, keeping the traditional recipes and inventing new variations. 
Let's not forget that sweets covered with honey (sugar to make syrop with was not easy to find) were very popular in Bysantine times, known with the term ""plakountia""... 
Therefore, a lot of recipes which are common in Turkey and in Greece are of ancient greek origin, though the turkish terms predominated because of the formal language of the Ottoman Empire... 
So, yes, dolma, yaprak, lukum (a), baklava, and cacik are of ancient greek origin, at least in their simplier version, adopted by the bysantines, improved by the greeks living in Turkey, and returned to Greece with the refugees in 1922.

This actually is the case on two fronts. First, ectomorphs process less calories, they excrete (the opposite of famine). Secondly, they feel full earlier and actually do eat a little less. They can ""whatever they want"" b/c they want less food. It's a double whammy towards under-weightiness just as the opposite is true.

No, thin people don't eat double what fat people eat, that's absurd, but they CAN eat about the same amount and appear underweight b/c they process less of it. ""It goes straight to my hips"" was not a myth and neither is its opposite. For others they throw off calories as if they exist in the Garden of Eden. No famine.

Really, we are agreeing. You are saying that metabolism varies among similarly aged people, as much as 300 calories, and that's enough to cause one group to be obese. It's common sense really. If you grow up with food stress your body will have a program that says ""save every calorie"" and it does and this has been studied due to WWII stats in Europe. It'd look it up.

You're correct that the difference in metabolism is very small but it need not be large to have an large appearing affect. 300 extra calories results in morbid obesity after only two years.

&gt;limited release

In Bruges had very wide release, just not in the States and was very actively promoted as well.

&gt;directed and written by someone new to the industry

Why is that a parameter for a lesser known movie? Is District 9 ""lesser known""?

&gt;In addition their production company and distributor was Focus, which distributes independent or foreign films.

In the States. You get it? It is a movie made in England. 

Still remains, ""In Bruges"" is far from ""lesser known"" here, just in Murica, which is not to say because most Murican movie viewers have a very limited range of experiences, namely only Hollywood productions. So, we get back to the question; is ""lesser known"" a label that is just viewed from the perspective of a Murican popcorn movie goer, or in global scale? As again, in global scale In Bruges is ""known"", just not in Muricana and as being in a specialized forum for ""movie enthusiasts"" I'd say we'd need to use a more demanding measurement here than compared to the average popcorn movie viewer.

If you'd discuss movies in a gaming forum, yes, I'd agree you can use this very shallow use of the label ""lesser known"", but as we are here amongst people who are supposed to have more experience, I'd say no, movies require to be assessed by global scale and by assumed popularity just like ""Snatch"" is an extraordinary popular movie amongst movie enthusiasts, but might not be known by your common popcorn movie goer.

**ADD**: In Europe production funding is a different system than in Hollywood. Usually you have a lot of smaller production companies which have different specialities as like Focus Features, who have expertise in distributing in the States, so you take them on board to this matter.

guildensterncrantz,CROA,Croatia,"No. [Here's my other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/68k3py/serbia_to_adopt_repressive_srebrenica_genocide/dgzd1yj/) explaining the difference between war crime and genocide. Ethnic cleansing follows the same logic, the *intention and planning* from the army/state/group of people to exterminate/chase away another group of people is what matters in both. Otherwise every single war where civilians die or flee would constitute as ethnic cleansing/genocide...

...which is literally every war. For example, a lot of civilians ran from Osijek once the siege started. That does NOT make the siege ""ethnic cleansing"", regardless of whether these civilians had reason to be afraid, or what would have happened to them if the city fell. Probably similar stuff to what happened to Vukovar, where ethnic cleansing DID happen, and we can prove that because the Vukovar civilians  - Croat civilians, so that's why it's *ethnic* - were forced out with arms.

Now. War crimes did happen to the Serbs that stayed. The perpetrators of that are still being prosecuted today. However the bulk that fled (by same reasoning as those that fled Osijek) weren't ordered to do so by Croatian politicians or generals, they weren't forced to do so with arms. (The army covered 630-km front in 4(!) days, just picture those logistics. They were rather too busy securing areas of military importance to *bother* organizing those columns.) The Serbs got the order to evacuate by their own leaders, and they did so.

*Intention.*

Since the difference between genocide and ethnic cleansing is in whether the people are killed or chased away, here:

&gt;In February 2015, at the conclusion of the Croatia–Serbia genocide case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) dismissed a Serbian lawsuit which alleged that Operation Storm constituted genocide, ruling that Croatia did not have the specific intent to exterminate the country's Serb minority, though it reaffirmed that serious crimes against Serb civilians had taken place. The court also found that the HV left accessible escape routes for civilians. According to the judgement, Serb civilians fleeing their homes, as well as those remaining in UN protected areas, were subject to various forms of harassment by both the HV and Croatian civilians.

So there you have it. Crimes were committed, but the planning and the goal of that operation - the intent - isn't there.

And it wasn't.

HOWEVER. Do I think that Tuđman and everyone else did everything possible to reassure the Serb civilians? No. To protect them? No. Did they feel very sorry that the Z-4 Plan was outright rejected by the SAO Krajina authorities, same Z-4 that would give Krajina similar rights as to what Republika Srpska got? Definitely not. Everybody was rather too busy celebrating the fact that Croatia wasn't gutted in the middle anymore to feel sorry about the fleeing Serbs. But that's neither here nor there when we're talking actual deeds vs the fallout (""oops"", he said innocently, ""I never told them to do that"").",True,0,1493651236,,False,0,dgzjs5f,t3_68k3py,t1_dgzi86c,1496166693,3,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,

I'm not sure why it's presented slightly differently in the US, but I do think that makes a difference. 

Another possible factor is that American sports leagues are almost all very insular communities with a small number of teams and nowhere else for players to go. It is entirely possible for a journalist to know most of the movers and shakers in a sport, and have good sources in every front office. That's just not possible in something as big, fluid, and complicated as European football, so I think there's more baseless speculation in place of informed speculation.

PixyFreakingStix,,,"&gt;I don't think the man is a bigot, or a racist but imagine being someone on the left who is undecided about Harris and decides to see his opinion on transgender people for example, so they google 'Sam Harris Transgender' and the first thing that pops up is a clip of him laughing while Douglas is roasting on transgender people for ten minutes.

I definitely agree with this. I get where Douglas Murray was coming from, but it was hard not to cringe at how openly resentful he was about this whole thing. And yeah, Sam chuckling along really irked me.

&gt;Or how about Black Lives Matter? Well, he's seen criticizing them as well, ""If Black Lives Matter got all the attention that it wants, it could set race relations back in this country a generation"".

Probably hyperbolic, but I actually don't see much to criticize him for here... sympathize with BLM's anger, but I also think actively making people hate you, giving fuel to racists who will take anything they can get, was definitely doing more harm than good.

I also think BLM was another thing people *massively* overreacted to. It was here and gone in a couple of months, yet people are still discussing this phenomenon as though it's this terrible threat to security and stability.

&gt;On top of that he's a white dude who criticizes Islam at a volume that only Robert Spencer can match

Definitely not true, but even if it was, the problem with Spencer isn't his *volume*...

&gt;and now he's seemingly an advocate for 'race realism'.

Is that really what you got from the Charles Murray episode..?

&gt;They just see a dude who talks about racial IQ differences, attacks Islam constantly, invites on 'neo-cons' (whatever that word means anymore) like David Frum, Anne Applebaum and Douglas Murray but not prominent far left speakers like Ta Nehisi Coates...

Agreed here too. I've been complaining for a long time that the lack of liberals on his program is troubling considering how often he complains about the left, and how often he's stated (though not so much anymore...) that Waking Up is meant to be a place where difficult conversations happen.

&gt;You can't honestly say that it doesn't look REALLY bad from an outside perspective and it really does nothing to bridge the gap between the left and the center which I believe is Harris's main intention.

Add to this some of the off-the-cuff style-over-substance remarks he's made. ""European facists are the only ones making sense about Islam"" or ""It may even be ethical to kill someone for their belief"" and then explain that with something that isn't *actually* killing someone for their belief. He handled his 'conversation' with Noam Chomsky poorly as well, and has made some hyperbolic criticism of him.

When Sam gets a bad reaction to these things, he's always baffled by it. I suspect the reason is because he doesn't believe bigotry is nearly as big of a problem as it actually is, and therefore doesn't realize the negative impact he's making in that area.

I've said before that, just as Sam was shocked to discover at least 20% of his fans were Trump supporters, some similarly large number are bigots; either sexist or Islamaphobic or otherwise racist.

For anyone paying attention, that 20% of his listeners supported Trump was not surprising in the least. And the fact that he didn't realize that what he's been saying *encouraged* people to support Trump is at least a little concerning.

I'd be incredibly surprised if we don't see many thinly veiled racist rulings in France should we see her get in to power even if you believe she isn't. 

Don't get me wrong though, I think the EU is seriously screwing up in Europe and they seem oblivious to confronting people's genuine concerns, bordering racist or otherwise. And let's not bother pretending most of people's issues are anything other than essentially racist, or more succinctly, being worried about the erosion of their country's traditional values. It's a grey area. Am I racist for saying I want my country to keep its traditional values? No. But to maintain those values you'll have to enact racist decrees because your country's traditional values do not align with many people living in your country from foreign descent. So on some level you have to acknowledge that by voting for a nationalistic party, you're knowingly voting in future racist laws. 

And the problem is most people who are strongly nationalistic are essentially pretty unpleasant people. Why would anyone be so defensive about a fucking invisible border and what side of it you were born on? That's so unbelievably pathetic. So vote them in to power and you're going to see some nasty shit go down. If you're proud of seeing families broken  apart in the name of restoring your country's traditions then shame on you. When do we start spitting on foreigners? Evicting them from their businesses and homes? Bulldozing neighbourhoods? Does the thought of that make you proud? Yes I'm taking it far because that's what ultimately happens with right wing/fascist/nationalistic parties. Because that's what they secretly truly want inside. We've witnessed it throughout history and we can witness it in action right now in any country that's ultra nationalist or led by a facist/dictator-esque leader. 

But yes the EU is partly to blame because they have take things too far to the other extreme and not considered how their laws would actually impact people's conscience. They've tried to impose political correctness through acceptance of foreigners when countries weren't fully ready for it or didn't expect how far and how quickly things would change. Yet even now they still dogmatically stick to their guns rather than admit maybe there's a better way. A middle ground.

The trouble is people don't want to wait for the EU to change or accept their mistakes, so instead they invite in the devil.

Nico2845,FR-IDFR,Moody Parisian,"&gt; France is tightly integrated into the EU, and discussing EU matters with Merkel is not really comparable to discussing geopolitical issues with Putin.

A guy with no mandate who has never been elected in any office is meeting with a foreign head of state = ok because pro-EU.

A woman elected member of the EU parliament meeting with a foreign head of state = not ok because anti-EU.

A democracy has opposition parties. They have the right to actively seek foreign support from whoever support their positions, which is exactly what Macron did with Merkel: he is pro-EU and wanted the support of the most powerful leader of the EU. 

Contrary to what you think, being anti-EU is a completely legal opinion and it's also legal to call for it. Is it stupid? I personally think so, yes. Getting in bed with Putin is pure madness to me. But she has every right to want to achieve this, and there is nothing unethical about it.

So from the perspective of an undemocratic shithole it's unethical. Glad you finally admit you share Putin's undemocratic views.

&gt; President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker accused British Prime Minister Theresa May of being &amp;quot;Delusional&amp;quot; over her demands for Brexit, German newspaper &amp;quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung&amp;quot; reported on Sunday.

&gt; Brexit secretary David Davis reportedly denied claims during the meeting that the UK would owe upwards of 60 billion euros to the EU, saying it could not force them to pay up.

&gt; EU leaders took just 15 minutes to agree upon a Brexit negotiating position at a meeting in Brussels on Saturday.

But as much as they don't care about the issues outside their London bubble, never mind in the other countries of the UK, the absolute worst thing a UK government could do would be to reject a second independence referendum if one were requested.

Given that the SNP were elected as the largest party in Scotland based on a manifesto which includes IndyRef2 as a promise (should Scotland vote to remain in the EU referendum and rUK vote to leave, which happened), rejecting a request from Scotland to hold IndyRef2 undermines the Scottish Parliament and makes it crystal clear what the Westminster government thinks about the other countries of the UK, if it wasn't clear already.

I assume coupled with the EU demanding y'all take all those refugees, which surely increased your Muslim pop by a lot, looking at most cities being 15%-25% Muslim, that it creates a powder keg with so many Muslims in small areas and radical mosques reaching them all.

davidoffetx,,Sobranie,"Hey guys, just got my order from Cigsspot; I have never ordered from them before, only Ciggiesworld. I'm posting a complete review for them and the cigs that I tried from them.

**Ease of ordering**: decent site, I wanted some cigs not on their site, and after corresponding with them, they let me know they could get them. The cigs they got for me not on their site were the Sobranie Black Russians, and Gauloises Blondes. The Black Russians were pretty expensive and ran about $65 for a carton. I also ordered Davidoff Classic, Marlboro Red, and Sobranie Black. They use bitcoin, so this is a bit of a pain, especially for large orders because it is difficult to buy bitcoin online and inconvenient. 

**Shipping**: They told me about a 5 days to North America, and this was exactly correct. Shipping out of their location was delayed because of a snowstorm that hit Europe in late April, this is not Cigsspot's fault because the shippers delayed pickup. Cigsspot gave me updates the whole way through, so they did a great job here. I ordered almost exactly 2 weeks ago, and I just got them. They have very fast shipping, which is a big plus.  Shipping ran about $50, which is really high, but hey, at least it gets to you fast.

**Service**: Really good, they seem a lot more attentive than Ciggiesworld, and really were on top of their game on this. For reference, I made an order with Ciggiesworld at roughly the same time and still have not gotten it (it is confirmed now that it is impossible for Ciggiesworld Cigs to get to the US now via air, so shipping to US now takes 3 months) I asked them for suggestions for the next order and they gave them to me, also I had some further special requests for next order, and they were able to tell me what they could and couldn't get. 

**Cigarettes**: 
**Sobranie Black Russian**- Really good smoke. Standard EU packaging (said duty free on the box), thankfully not in a plain package, which they are now in, in England. These were the most expensive cigs I got. Beautiful packaging and these cigs were really good, really smooth, sweet and spicy. Highly aromatic. Based on previous experience smoking them in Europe and elsewhere, very in line with my previous experience. These are a 10/10 for me.

**Gauloises Blondes**- These are some of my favorite cigs, period. They're plain packaged in France now, which is a shame, but thankfully Cigsspot's came in EU Duty Free packaging. They are really smooth and have a great taste. For me, these are a 9/10 and some of my all time favorites. They seem impossible to get now, and Ciggiesworld doesn't sell them. So bravo Cigsspot for finding these for me!

**Sobranie Black**- I think these are a Moldovan cig b/c I was never able to find them in England, but I could be wrong. These have less nicotine than the Sobranie Black Russian and the Gauloises, but they still are a middle of the road cig, even though Sobranie is a luxury brand. Good taste, very mild, not as spicy and aromatic as the Black Russian. These would be solid for a daily go-to smoke and the packaging is beautiful. Also gotta love the Sobranie logo on the filter. These also have a recessed filter like a Parliament which is cool, I guess. 8.25/10.

**Marlboro Red**- I love the packaging on European Red's, so much more appealing than North American packaging. I think these are special Moldovan ones, and they say something on the pack about a ""Hard Filter"", whatever that means. Very mild like the Sobranie Black. I would give them a 7.5/10 because of mild nicotine content, but the redeeming factor is the amazing packaging.

**Davidoff Classic Red**- One of my favorite all time smokes. Very standard Davidoff packaging that you will find worldwide. These are also 100's which is a plus. Good taste, smooth smoke, better nicotine and tar content than the Marlboros and the Sobranie Blacks. These get an 8.75/10.

All these smokes were manufactured in Ukraine or Moldova as far as I can tell, they may taste different from Western European cigs of the same brand and type. As far as I know these are all non-FSC and don't have the noticeable chemical taste to them. The Sobranie Black Russians and Gauloises Blondes both were in duty free packaging with English warning s on them. 

I certainly will be ordering from Cigsspot again based on selection, fast shipping, and great service. I def. think these guys are worth it. Final note, you have to order 5 cartons minimum for US, unless you wanna pay a really high shipping rate for one or two cartons. These guys are great. 5/5 overall.",True,0,1493658442,,1493669748,0,dgzptd7,t3_68n2nj,t3_68n2nj,1496169595,1,False,Cigarettes,t5_2qjd2,

Daumenkino,,,"This was very informative of your issue. But unfortunately, the only time I can save you is to suggest you set the split clip function to a hot key so you won't have to select all or go into a menu.

Well done on the bouncing animation as well. It's the perfect beginners exercise. 

Let me copy and paste an answer I got from a professional animator when I asked him about animating on ""ones - twos""

&gt;They haven't taught you guys about framerate at school? Are you taking Animation, or something else?
Television framerate falls under two types, NTSC and PAL. The States are NTSC, which means we watch video at 30fps (29.97, but lets not get technical). PAL (Europe mostly) runs at 25fps. Film runs at 24fps. You can look up this stuff on Wiki.
Either way, animation relies on the persistence of motion illusion, same as film. Run enough pictures past the eyes fast enough, and photos or drawings appear to move. 
Because we have to draw every frame, everyone's looking to cut down on the workload. The lowest you can usually drop your framerate before people really notice is about 8-10fps. At that speed, motion appears to ""stutter"", because people are percieving the individual images more clearly. But at 12 or 15fps, the illusion usually holds up. 
To this end, most animation is drawn in what we call ""twos"". That is to say, we let a drawing stay on screen for two frames of time. This effectively means that animation is running at 15fps, but too many students make the mistake of setting their default framerate at 15fps. This is wrong, because no matter what you set your framerate as, when it's broadcast it runs at 30fps.
Variable framerate (I'm getting there) is when we mix up the framerate within the 30fps range. By setting the default framerate at 30, the max number of frames allowed per second, we can decide whether to hold a drawing for 2 frames (standard), one frame (fast as possible) or even 3 or 4 frames (slow to stuttery, but there's times when it applies). So the framerate varies through the composition from 15 to 30 to 10 and back (or ""ones"", ""twos"" and ""threes"". To run animation in threes means to hold for three frames, or 10fps)
Then you export at 30fps, ready for display. But by employing variable framerates, you can take advantage of the full speed of the broadcast framerate while enjoying the benefits of reducing your workload to the minimum required for smooth motion.
I hope that makes some sense. When you watch a DVD frame-by-frame (at least on a good DVD player or PC media player) you can see, by moving forward one frame at a time, how long drawings are held for in an animated sequence. Very classy, high-quality animation runs at full speed, but most anime, even the good stuff, uses a variable framerate.

In summary, just because your framerate is 24 frames per second. Doesn't mean you should, or have to draw 24 frames.

There were two rival leave campaigns, Leave.eu and Vote Leave.

Mr Farage was part of Leave.eu

I remember that Leave.eu was really annoyed by Vote Leave using that message. I also vaguely remember one of Leave.eu being interviewed about it, saying it's misleading and they shouldn't be using it.

The two camps were actually bitter rivals because Mr Farage was in one, and Douglas Carswell was in the other (to give one reason).

So Mr Farage indeed wasn't behind it, but you bring up his £55m/day figure....

While he DID say ""£55m a day"" he didn't say ""£55m for the NHS"" because (again, from memory) Mr Farage was always saying that the money the UK gets back from the EU may only be spent in the way the EU dictates - so it's out of the UK's control, and that the UK should be deciding how to distribute that money to its own farmers, concert halls, museums, etc.

So I *think* that's why he's saying it's nothing to do with him, coz it's really not been his message for the past twenty years. His has been more detailed, and I can't recall him _ever_ saying it could all go the NHS.

I do think he's said that _some_ of that money could go towards the NHS, but (unless there's footage of him saying otherwise) I can't recall him ever saying it could all go there.",True,0,1493659740,,False,0,dgzqxls,t3_68l8g6,t1_dgzkuma,1496170133,3,False,ukipparty,t5_2vl06,

RagingBeryllium,,,"It's a bad argument for many reasons.

Let's take Germany considering that's the one people seem to be mentioning. So refugees in Germany are legible for something called a blue passport that allows that to enter many European countries without a visa provided they are:

1. Not staying for more than 3 months

2. Do not seek employment

This blue passport does not grant refugees this visa free travel to the UK.

Now, for an actual German passport - that through the current law in the UK and EU (with free movement of people) would allow a refugee in Germany to move to the UK. We should first note that there is no fast track for refugees to receive a German passport and the same rules apply to them as they do anyone else. This means that a refugee attempting to receive a German passport must - on top of regular paperwork etc:

1. Have a valid residency permit (beyond refugee status)

2. Have been ordinarily resident in Germany for 8 years (this can be reduced to 7 years if an integration course has been passed and in the case of refugees can be reduced to 6 years according to discretion, 3 years of continual residence in Germany if married to a German citizen for 2 years.)

3. Confirm their commitment to the free democratic constitutional system establish by German Basic Law.

4. Is able to support themselves without the use of the benefits system

5. Has not been sentenced for any unlawful act nor subject to any form of court order.

6. Be able to independently speak German at an adequate level

7. Possess knowledge of the legal system, society, and living conditions in Germany.

Now the question becomes why would we have to worry about any refugees who can support themselves independently in Germany, speak German, have lived in Germany for a minimum of 6 years, never been convicted of a crime, and passed tests confirming their knowledge of the German legal system and German society, coming to the UK? How many refugees would do all of this just to move to the UK? If you initially wanted to go to the UK - but instead now spoke German, had a job that meant you required no benefits, had lived in Germany for 6/8 years would you still go? For the ones that did come why worry anyway - they would likely be ""high flyers"" who could speak at least three languages including English and could compete for top level jobs.

It's a silly argument because countries don't just hand out passports and by the time any Syrian refugee got a German passport they'd very likely just want to stay in Germany being a productive member of German society.",True,0,1493660019,,False,0,dgzr6c1,t3_68kwhh,t1_dgzm0gu,1496170249,5,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,

bestem,california text,California,"&gt; Is it considered 'weird' for Americans to live in close proximity to their families?

On the street I grew up...

* There was a duplex.  Father lived in one half of the duplex, his daughter in the other half.  Across the street from them was a single family home.  The father's son and wife lived in that house. About 15 houses down the street lived the wife's brother and his wife.

* Across the street and one house down from me lived an older couple.  Four houses down the street, in a duplex, lived their son, his wife, and their kids.
 
* One of my brother's friends family's (the friend being a kid, and the family being parents) lived next door to us.  Next door to them was the older step-brother of my brother's friend.
 
* My brother's friend moved out.  A friend of mine moved in next door, with her family (parents and two younger brothers).  On the other side of us, for as long as even my parents can remember, lived her grandparents.  Her grandfather died when we were still really young.  They moved out a few years after moving in, when one of the kids accidentally burned down the house.  Her grandmother died a few years ago, and her uncle and his kids are now living in the house her grandparents lived in.
 
* About twenty houses down the street lived an older guy my dad knew and his wife.  Right next door to them lived their daughter.

Is this common?  No.  But find the right place to live, and you need more than ""I want to get away from my family"" to want to leave.  If either of the houses next door to my dad went up for sale, and I could afford them, I'd move there in a heartbeat, despite living a 10 hour drive away right now.  Not too much further than just right next door, as the backyards start shrinking again on either side, although other places in the neighborhood wouldn't be bad.  I loved where I grew up.

orthodoxparadox,s1 9 team-9 country-esp,Real Madrid,"Do we? That's pretty much all we do. I don't blame him, though. He's in an unenviable position.  
Besides the Morata/Benz debate, he has:  
Bale, Isco, James, Kroos, Modrić, Kovačić, Casemiro, Asensio and Vazquez for 4 positions.  
Casemiro mostly starts because he offers defensive stability. But I really don't think Casemiro has enough intelligence to play in the midfield for us. I'm pretty sure Marcos Llorente will replace him next year.  
Kroos and Modrić always start the big games and it's tough to argue against that.  
Kovačić is biding his time but he's another guy who can play any position in midfield INCLUDING CDM. He was brilliant against both Atléti at the Calderón and against Depor at Riazor.  
Asensio too is young and is happy with his minutes. He's almost certainly going to be a Real Madrid legend in the next 10 years.  
The biggest problems are Isco and James. Isco is so, so good. But I'm not sure if he's have started if Bale was not. Bale can change the game on his own, but Zidane, for some reason, doesn't drop him even when he's out of form. However, I think he'll be a certain starter next year. That could be the only possible reason he's been convinced to stay.  
As for James, as sad as I am, I think he'll leave this summer. Supremely talented, but there are just so many people.

seamushoo4,lfc68,,"&gt; t it should have been all three in both g

10000% agree here, /u/podpool3 ... those games looked like sure locks for the two manchester sides. i think it puts a couple things in perspective for us fans though. 

1. these so called 'lesser' teams, are still a pain in the side and causing everyone problems. most of the top 6 are playing smaller, more technical players...not the traditional 'british' style. Spurs and Chelsea the two most balanced in terms of playing the tough yet technical football (spurs really being a shining light in the premier league for me, but having a tough go of things in europe). 

2. Injuries hurt the big teams immensely. No team can just really walk the league with their back ups. We struggled from January on because of injuries, united are starting to feel the impacts of a ton of injuries, city have had a number of injuries/players who are not fit enough to play 2-3 times per week. 

AS pissed as i've been in some of our losses (and some of our draws i.e. sunderland, bournemouth 2, West ham all standing out to me)...the randomness of the league is starting to show up elsewhere in the top 6. United have scraped by in so many more matches than they've already drawn by getting a jammy goal, but they haven't necessarily had the same bad luck as us. Chelsea, they have really squeaked by in so many matches. I am confident that Klopp is learning from these mistakes, but still a work in progress. I think we have enough room to win 3, lose 1 or win 2 and draw 2. I really think that's the only amount of leeway that we have (provided that united and arsenal draw and that united lose to spurs.)

ultimately though, we need to win at least our next 2 just to put united and arsenal further into the rearview. If we get to 2 games left to play and we're up 3-6 points up on united and arsenal, I could see it being completely out of sight.

Poate ca am exagerat putin, dar 5000 lei la Timisoara nu mai sunt o exagerare.

Presupunand ca vrei sa spui 6000 lei / luna la Bucuresti in loc de 3000 lei, exista numeroase motive pentru care o suma de 5000 ar fi suficienta la Timisoara:

* chirii mai mici: tu ai stat cu 250 euro cu o camera la Bucuresti, dar acum cat timp? Eu am stat cu 150 euro cu o camera la Timisoara, acum 2 ani. :)) Deja ai economisit vreo 675 lei fata de Bucuresti.

* distractiile si mancarea sunt mai ieftine la Timisoara decat la Bucuresti. Iar economisesti vreo 1-200 lei

* haine nu imi iau lunar (poate mi-as lua daca as fi fata :)) ), ci in functie de sezon, sa zicem, deci nu as pune asta la socoteala

* un motiv foarte important e si timpul cu care poti sa ramai liber, dupa ce iesi de la serviciu, iar asta e cam priceless: trafic infernal &amp; stuff din Bucuresti nu e pe placul oricui. E misto sa scapi de job si apoi sa ai timp si de o alta activitate, pe care sa o desfasori in aceeasi zi

Am un coleg de serviciu satmarean care a studiat in Londra si a lucrat acolo la Microsoft, dar care e multumit cu cat economiseste si aici.

VegetaLF7,20,,"One of the things I really enjoyed about lightsaber dueling, at least in the EU, was the concept that there was a battle of the minds going on at the same time. Each fighter is attempting to use the Force to out maneuver their opponent, predict where they'll go, try and sabotage each other, and so on. One of the first skills an EU Force user learns is to create a barrier around them to prevent the opponent from simply switching their blade off with the Force, or something similar. Given Jedi and Sith are practically superhuman with the ability to predict the future, it helps explain why their saber duels last so long compared to a proper swordfight. If you can predict exactly what your opponent will do, and they do the same to you, you both are constantly going to be countering each other until one slips up. As the fight nears the conclusion, one fighter will make a mistake or just wear out long enough to leave an opening for their opponent to end it. Lightsaber duels are as much a battle of attrition as they are individual skill.

An excellent example of this is in the Darth Bane novels. Bane's apprentice, Zannah, is a petite woman armed with a double-bladed saberstaff like what Darth Maul would eventually use. The thing was, her blades were far shorter than Maul's. During one particular fight, she was defending herself from multiple Jedi. These Jedi were better swordsmen than she was, but she had mastered a defensive style and simply focused on protecting herself from the Jedi attacks until they slipped up long enough for her to take advantage of it and kill one quickly.",True,0,1493660908,,False,0,dgzry7i,t3_68gfqi,t3_68gfqi,1496170622,1,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,

yet_another_person_,trans-straight,: MtF : 20 : ,"Well, some countries have free or nearly free university, and that should include technical ones. I am pretty certain that a lot of universities in Germany are that way, as well as Norway, and several others. 

The problem with places like that, is that while you may pay no tuition, other things: food, housing, and just cost of living all around is going to be way higher than further East. I haven't gone through and tried to do all of the calculations for this sort of thing in a while, but I feel like last time I did, it looked like it would be cheaper to live in a place like Romania or Hungary, and pay tuition, than live in say, Norway, and not (of course, the cost of uni depends also on what you're studying in some cases). My sense is that if you do your research and find well suited universities, it probably is not going to be too difficult to get accepted to at least one, but the problem remains finances. Some Universities offer subsidized housing, but outside of a limited area I do not know what its like (where I was, it was packed, dirty, and loud, but very convenient and close to the uni, and relatively cheap. If you are not able to be housed with your designated sex in close quarters, this might not be an option). 

I would do more research into this looking for countries and universities that offer scholarships for eu students. The trope is that scholarships are for really good students, and some are, but that doesn't by any means imply that all are going to be taken by people with perfect scores from high school. Considering your situation, it seems worth a shot, as the benefit offered by a scholarship could be so huge.

It is certainly possible to live abroad and get by without a degree, I know more than a few people who do. But its not exactly easy to just, plop down in a new country, even if its possible. I would refer to my earlier post in this thread: the main question then becomes where can you get a job. Do you know any national languages, apart from Latvian and English? Do you have friends in any other countries who would be accepting, and not tell your family? In my experience, even if you know English and can get by, you will be an outsider if you do not know the local language, and it will almost certainly be harder to find a job, place to live, et cetera. The degree to which this is true probably depends where you go, but I imagine it is true, to a degree most everywhere. Friends can also help with this, if they're already settled and can help you find a job and housing and just generally learn how to get by. Sadly, a thousand euro does not offer you a large buffer, so wherever you go, you need to find a means of income asap, if you cannot stay with friends. Look into possible destinations and see what an apartment costs there, or try to contact people and see what they spend on food, transport, et cetera, if you want to get a better guess for how long you could last.
 
One question that I have to ask is: what time frame are you looking at? If you have three months to get a plan worked out, that's a lot different than a year, or a week.

iinavpov,,,"This is the misunderstanding at the heart of it. 

60 million is small. Would people want to trade with your hypothetical island? Of course, but not at any cost. Iceland, for example is part of the EEA and has FOM. Norway, a petro-state is part of the EEA, Switzerland, a fiscal paradise, is in effect part of the EEA, and has FOM.

Now, what would we trade? Well, we do services, therefore FOM is particularly good for us: people trading goods care much less. And this is the thing we want to get rid off. What do we need? Pretty much everything: we are, after all ,an island with little natural resources.

Trade is not simple in the 21st century. You can instantly tell someone is speaking out of their arse if they tell you it's about tariffs. Its not, it's about shared norms, rules of origin, recognised laws. These things need courts to be enforced, which are mutually recognised, and above national jurisdictions. This is what the ECJ is (not the court of human rights, that's nothing to do with the EU). But we want out. 

Trade needs travel. By what right can you go hollydaying in France? The reason is that there is an agreement that citizens of the EU can travel around. Without that, barring a special agreement, you'd need a Shengen visa. Maybe there will be a waiver for that, but what about health insurance? Currently, you get coverage everywhere, and the NHS will pick up the tab -- and reciprocally for people coming here. But we want out, terrified that we are of health tourism.

And there are many other things, but these are the ones which come  immediately to mind.

ToTheRescues,florida text,Florida,"Generally speaking, it's much easier to relocate all the way across the country for us. No language barriers and very little cultural difference.

Is it common? Very. When I tell someone that virtually my whole family lives in one city, they're shocked as that is rare.

&gt;Is it considered 'weird' for Americans to live in close proximity to their families?

No, but a lot of young people are usually itching to move far away from where they were raised because it's ""boring"" or ""uninteresting"". However, we are the opposite here. We move to the boring places because we can't afford to live in our home town.

&gt;Assuming a normal family relationship, how often do you see your parents if you live more than 200 miles away?

Ever since I moved out, I've lived about 50 miles away from my parents. I've worked for the family business, so in that case, I'd see them everyday. But other than that, holidays or the occasional dinner on the weekend.

&gt;Is moving from one state to another considered a big deal (like leaving your country of birth in Europe is) or is it considered very normal? Is it easy, bureaucracy-wise?

As far as I know, it's easy. The only thing I can think you'd need to do is update driver's license and registration? Also, your taxes could change as some states do/do not have Income Tax, etc.

&gt;How common is it for people to marry someone from another state?

Very common. My parents for example are from different states and later married in a state that they both weren't born in.

&gt;Does education play a big role in the distance someone lives away from their parents?

It might a little bit for people who go to out of state university and end up staying there, but other than that, I don't think so. I hear more about people moving away out of desperation or for opportunity and they weren't very educated.

Just to give you a personal anecdote, when my dad was 18 years old, him and a couple of his friends decided to take a trip from Florida to Alaska (without their parents consent) and they all lived up there for a few years.",True,0,1493661116,,False,0,dgzs4sf,t3_68my7p,t3_68my7p,1496170709,3,False,AskAnAmerican,t5_2uah7,

However, the Empire's chronic manpower problems, structural issues rendering it a less efficient power projector than in the past, and changing social, economic, and power dynamics in western Europe meant that soon after Justinian's death there was a long confrontation between the Lombardo/Italic aristocracy in Italy and the Greek-Speaking Byzantines, dividing Italy.

&gt; * S. Erdem Ayta, Luis Schiumerini, and Susan Stokes in their paper, Protests and Repression in New Democracies, in the journal, Perspectives on Politics (March 2017), seek to identify the possible motivating factors for democratic governments when dealing with popular protests, especially with a backlash following crackdown on initial protests.

&gt; * While Mr. Erdogans government used full-scale repression, the Brazilian and Ukrainian governments reacted with relatively less-repressive actions, even seeking to negotiate.

&gt; * Using survey research and interviews with civilian authorities, police officials and protesters in the three countries, the authors argue that the strategies were motivated by concerns regarding electoral security of the parties in power.

&gt; * The authors also test out alternate hypotheses such as civilian control over police, ideological orientation of the government, social class of protesters and the nature of the threat and find that the dissimilarity of the reactions in Turkey and Ukraine despite regime and structural similarities are explained more by the electoral security argument.

As I said as well in the previous post, many, many more migrants enter Italy, Spain and Greece, but these countries are NOT allowed to send the migrants to other EU countries, without their permission.

If a country, like Germany, WANTS to intake more refugees, they CAN, they are a sovereign state. But they are NOT required to under EU law. 

Also, Germany can spend as many euros as they want on migrants. Again, they are a sovereign country and no EU law limits the amount or sets a minimum either. France is not required to spend as much. 
In reality, countries that take migrants under the relocation program are given money to cover the expenses.

**Turkey President Erdogan backs India's UNSC bid** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan supported India's bid for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council, even as he called for major reforms in the exclusive body.Referring to the ongoing fight against the ISIS, the crisis in Syria and countries like the US, Russia and Iran supporting different groups in the region, Erdogan said using one terrorist organisation against another can be counter- productive.Noting that there are ""differences"" as well as ""commonalities"" between the two countries, India and Turkey must ""quash"" prejudices against each other, he said.He also said that India-Turkey relations are ""significantly behind"" their potential and for a fair world both countries have to work together.""India, with a population of 1.3 billion is not a part of the UNSC. Over 1.7 billion people live in the Islamic world but they too are not a part of the UNSC. A nation like Japan is not a part of the group. This is not a healthy sign. We need a fair and just world order by bringing in significant reforms in the UNSC ,"" Erdogan said here.The Turkish leader said one cannot expect the UN Security Council to dispense justice without more representation.The membership of the body should be on a rotational basis with 20 to 30 countries holding the mantle at a time so that all nations get a chance to be a member of the key world body, he said.""Only five permanent members (the US, Russia, France, China and the UK) have veto power in the UNSC. The non- permanent members' vote does not count. (Then) why do they deceive (the world)? The UNSC cannot dispense justice,"" the Turkish President said.Erdogan, who is on a two-day visit to India, was speaking in Turkish at the Jamia Millia Islamia university where he was awarded a Doctor of Letters degree.However, earlier there was opposition from a section of students over honouring Erdogan alleging ""he is involved in blatant human rights violation and has become a dictator in Turkey"".Erdogan said the existing global order was ""shying away"" from dealing with those violating human rights, as he attacked his Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad Lashing out at ISIS, Erdogan said the terrorist group is ""blasphemy"" in the name of Islam and has no connection with the religion.""Terrorism can only be fought by tackling poverty and inequality. It will be unfair to blame religion for terrorism,"" he said.Erdogan also urged Indians not to view Turkey from the ""prism"" of the western media.""Please, please, please do not follow the western media when you look at Turkey. This is a propaganda against Turkey by the western media and terrorist organisations,"" he said.Erdogan also blamed the world community for not doing much while his country was fighting ISIS with full commitment.He said, Turkey shares a nearly 900 km border with Syria and has accommodated nearly three million Syrian refugees, spending over USD 25 billion on this.""Yet, the global players are not ready to share the responsibility. The European Union promised USD 3 billion, but has only given USD 750 million,"" the Turkish president said.Asserting that he was the only world leader to have visited Somalia, Erdogan said no other leader has visited the terror-hit African nation.

The reason the Netherlands have their healthcare and education -- the same way the UK had a good, state healthcare system, or how the US implemented the New Deal &amp; social security, *historically*, are a result of the labor movement and working class agitating, striking, protesting, and violently lashing out at capitalists. 

It wasn't done because capitalists or politicians care about workers or because they feel like they have to represent workers. If capitalists could pay you and me 0$ for our day's work they would, and if politicians didn't have to worry about losing their jobs or lives, we would still be fighting for an 8hr day.

 The few politicians who do normally have short terms, are killed, jailed, or forcefully put in a bad light or outright ignored--nothing has changed how Debs was seen in the mainstream media back then, to how Sanders (Or Corbyn, for euro peeps) was ignored and redbaited one hundred years after Debs.

Consider a typical flight from Europe to NYC.  There's a decent chance you'll arrive before noon or after 10pm.  The hotel industry at large seems blissfully unaware of this reality, and as evidenced by this thread, has conditioned their staff to react with indignation to the perfectly reasonable frustrations of a significant minority of their customers.

&gt; Do you actually go out into the world at all, or are you just a sad little millennial tool sitting at home in moms basement whining about the hotel can't jump through hoops to meet your magic specifications! Wow!

Awesome name-calling. Since you brought it up, it's statistically likely that I'm older than you are by at least a decade.  I've probably travelled more than you have too, just by virtue of my age.  I also have some tangential professional experience with revenue managers and their staff, particularly around booking systems.

I get that this is a sub for industry folks to vent.  But I think there's something wrong when staff have to deal with this kind of request ""Every. Single. Sunday"", and nobody has come along and tried to create a solution (other than: ""book two nights when you want a odd-sized 12-hour block"").

I can imagine the logistics of offering such a product would be challenging, but I don't think they're insurmountable.  Especially with advance notice of booking parameters, scheduling staff, and even off-hours vacuuming, ought to be doable.  Sure it would cost more, and pricing would have to reflect that.  But it's doable.  Let's not pretend that most properties are anywhere near 100% occupancy most of the time.

I think one of the big stumbling blocks here is technology infrastructure in the market.   PMSes don't support this kind of operation, and the capital expense and risk involved in building/deploying a system that could make it unattractive.  Add third-party inertia and I can see why it's not at the top of anyone's list.  I really do.

But just because it's hard/risky doesn't mean that it's not a regular frustration for your customers.

All that said, I do have a tendency to underestimate the extreme price sensitivity of the public at large.  Maybe I'm doing that here.  But personally, I'd love the option to pay $300 for a $200 room when my flight arrives at 2AM and I want the room from 3AM-2PM into the next afternoon.  Currently, my only option is to pay $400 for the privilege, even though it's likely that even with a 3PM checkout, housekeeping can still turn the room without annoying other guests, and the guy with the flight that arrives at 7PM can check in just fine at 8PM.

qualquer historiador te diz que, muito antes do feudalismo, todas as grandes economias assentavam na guerra e na escravatura. **ninguém** defende que foram os portugueses a inventar a escravatura em si mesma, e o artigo não diz isso. o artigo diz apenas que iniciaram o comércio de escravos para a Europa em 1441 (ver Antão Gonçalves).

Tenseiga1,,,"Everyone in my family is black. Some are very light-skinned, some are very dark, some are in the middle. It's pretty much impossible to find a black person with zero history of race mixing. Either because of slave rape or consensual sex. I don't have any relationships with anyone with a STEM job. Most of my family do pretty well, especially given the additional challenge of being black in America. Some have degrees, some don't. I have a cousin employed by the government to translate other languages for important people, I have a cousin who takes what work they can get. Most are musicians and singers. In my experience people's success in life is determined by what they do with what cards they were dealt. Black people have variety like any human. 

You seem like a decently smart guy whose hurting your perception of people by focusing on race (black people in particular). It's culture, socio-economic issues, and history. You can study any race and stitch together some meaning or recurring themes. It shouldn't stop you from treating people as individuals.

Regarding the South African farm crimes. It's sad. It's terrible. This should not happen, period. But I have to consider the culture, the society, the socio-economics, and history. What little research I did showed not just crimes but laws that hurt black Africans. There was a law passed in the early 1910's that awarded 80 percent of all the land in South Africa to white Europeans living in Africa. It's clear that was the incident that fueled these attacks. I don't know much about Africa's history of black marginalization, just slavery and America's history with African people. Humans do what humans do when they are marginalized or oppressed, they fight, they steal, they kill. It's really wrong. But we have to consider the why and the how, not just the what and who.

I'm gonna paraphrase Lupe Fiasco here: 
The problem with racism is history. It's gonna be impossible to treat each other as just people when there's hundreds of years of oppression. And no one wants to let go of their culture. That goes both ways. The abusers need to stop hurting, and the abused have to learn to forgive.

There are legal protections for LGBT people, but social awareness of LGBT issues is pretty low compared to the US or Europe and most representations of LGBT people in media/society are very cartoonish and stereotyped.   Since homosexuality isn't something that people *talk* about in public, Japan is lagging behind in some civil rights issues.   There's not a strong religious prohibition against homosexuality and being anti-gay isn't part of political identity like it is in the US, but LGBT people still experience a lot of bias.  There's still a strong expectation for people to conform, get married and have kids, so anybody who deviates from that norm for whatever reason is seen as suspicious, irresponsible and psychologically damaged (especially by older generations).  Younger people are a lot more accepting. 

However, things that would be considered homoerotic in the US are considered normal in Japan.  Same-gender friends are a *lot* more physically intimate, and crossdressing has a long history in media (especially theatre).   Since it's assumed that everyone is straight and nobody talks about homosexuality, you can actually get away with acting a lot ""gayer"" than you could in most Western countries.

In the US, sexuality is thought of as a core part of identity that's fixed from birth, but in Japan it's kind of a fluid concept.  Like, I think most Westerners would think that someone who was into futanari or traps would definitely be a repressed homosexual, but in Japan it's treated more like a fetish, not a sexual orientation.

NoMyOwnFlashBang,text-pcmr color-pcmr,Core i5 6600k | GTX 1070 | Steam: ,"There is no such thing as an import tax for digital items. The ""Australia Tax"" is a phrase used to describe companies arbitrarily increasing the cost of software (and other items) to Australians relative to other markets. There are many factors that go into this increase but the largest is simply -&gt; smaller market + wealthier customers = higher price

GST is a consumption tax that applies to ALL goods and services sold in a country. The UK has the same sort of tax (it's actually 20% as opposed to 10%). Many other States do as well. Valve gets around not having to pay the VAT by basing their UK operations in another State. Thus the goods aren't legally being 'sold in the UK'. The law coming into Australia in July closes this loophole so they can't pull the same thing here. 

&gt;  because the US doesn't have a nationwide sales tax.

No, it doesn't. It uses competitive federalism and allows states to levy their own sales taxes. In some cases sales taxes in the good 'ol USA are higher than the GST. 

&gt; don't forget that Australia also has more regulations on video games than the US does, and releasing a game in Australia costs additional regulation costs.

Each sovereign state has their own laws and regulations surrounding the sale of media. Germany has incredibly strict laws.  Publishers budget for these laws in their development. Sometimes they get bitten on the ass (Stick of Truth). Vast majority of the time thing pass ratings agencies easily. Having your media rated doesn't automagically diminish your margins to the point of having to pass this onto the Australian consumer in such a large amount relative to other states.

Also, the EU member states have their own domestic regulations AND EU regulations. By your logic digital media in the EU should be more expensive. But it isn't, in many cases its cheaper. 

Edit: As another poster has said the reason for the introduction of GST to Steam is to make domestic stores more competitive. It's unfair for Valve to leverage their huge presence and use legal wrangling to not pay the GST when smaller, locally based, companies have to.

volkl47,boston text,Boston/Upstate NY/CNJ,"&gt;  But the fact that the USA has this advantage can't be only reason that Americans a so much more mobile ... right?

While the ease (more below) is a factor, it's also our culture. We are an individualistic society. Family is nice (hopefully), but in non-dysfunctional families the goal is for your children to go off, follow their dreams, and be successful. And it's rarely the case that the *best* opportunities for you are exactly where you grew up or/where your parents found them.

----------------------

&gt; Is it considered 'weird' for Americans to live in close proximity to their families? (for example, I know many American sitcoms use this as a comedic trope) 

If you've never lived elsewhere besides the same town/small area you grew up in, people will somewhat think you haven't really lived. Still living in the same state or having come back to the area after time elsewhere is not really looked down upon.

&gt; Assuming a normal family relationship, how often do you see your parents if you live more than 200 miles away? 

When I was living ~300mi away? Every month or two. When I was living on the other side of the country? A couple times a year.

&gt; Is moving from one state to another considered a big deal (like leaving your country of birth in Europe is) or is it considered very normal? Is it easy, bureaucracy-wise? 

No, it's very normal, and not much more difficult than moving in general (within your state) is. You need to go let the government know you've changed residences, as well as your insurance company and anything else (like banks, recurring bills, etc) your new address. But that's any time you move.

About the only additional hassle when you move states is that you need to go fill out some paperwork and get your driver's license and auto registration switched over.

&gt; How common is it for people to marry someone from another state? 

Extremely.

&gt; Does education play a big role in the distance someone lives away from their parents? 

Sure. People tend to go to university away from home, often far away from home. And once you've done that, people are often curious about seeing other parts of the country and less hesitant to move (since they've already been away from home). And the best opportunities for the well-educated tend to be in the major metro areas, so if you're not from there it's a big reason to not stay where you grew up.

 the researchers found, Muslims carried out only 11 out of the 89 attacks, yet those attacks received 44 percent of the media coverage. (Meanwhile, 18 attacks actually targeted Muslims in America. The Boston marathon bombing generated 474 news reports, amounting to 20 percent of the media terrorism coverage during the period analyzed. Overall, the authors report, ""The average attack with a Muslim perpetrator is covered in 90.8 articles. Attacks with a Muslim, foreign-born perpetrator are covered in 192.8 articles on average. Compare this with other attacks, which received an average of 18.1 articles.""

Fly Agaric is a large red and white mushroom prevalent in the northern hemisphere. Its usage goes back millennia. To Europeans it is basically part of our heritage. It is known to cause profound changes of awareness, stupor, comatose sleep and nausea. It is a really harsh experience if you use it to get high. In small doses it is very similar to zopiclone. And I can testify to its incredible effect on sleep. Never felt as well rested.. To be sure, wild mushrooms are a last resort though! I would only recommend it to a seasoned, responsible and careful person.

Not to be rude my friend, but periodical fasting has been a big part of human experience for all but the last 80 years. The Romans for example generally followed a one meal a day plan. Basically a 23 hour fast. If you are anything like the average person though, your dopamine receptors are basically fried and you need constant ""fixes"" (in the shapes of fat, salty and sugary foods, masturbation, coffee, tobacco and entertainment). If you don't get these fixes, you generally become miserable.

I'll post from the US POV, but if I'm going to sink in $1k at Coinbase, and turn it into $10k through price inflation and cash out, there's really no issue. Hundreds if not thousands of people have transferred large sums with no issue.

Now let's try to look at it from a different perspective. Say you're using coins that are associated with some crime--like some child porn ring got busted and you bought coins from them. You then send the money to Coinbase and then cash out. Yeah perhaps the feds will come knocking and figure out what's up with that.

I love this defense, and I fucking love that you reek of white supremacy and your username is ""free thinker"". I love how often you alt-right folks brand your cult programming as free thought, calling your blue pills ""red"". Good stuff.

But let's pretend like you don't reek of alt-right desperation and give you the proof you desire that alt-right and white supremacy are interlinked from foundation to current times, so that you can avoid replying in shame as you realize your last defense ""do all of the work for me so I can nitpick details as a deflection technique away from accepting any of the facts at all"" has failed

http://www.npr.org/2016/11/27/503520811/the-white-nationalist-origins-of-the-term-alt-right-and-the-debate-around-it

&gt;Interviewer to Richard Spencer: I asked him to respond to the argument that the term is really just a euphemism for white supremacy.

&gt;Richard Spencer:  In some ways the alt-right is arbitrary. I mean, the whole point is that this is a movement of consciousness and identity for European people in the 21st century. That's what it is. If you don't like it, you can, you know, talk about linguistics

Okay, so we have Richard Spencer agreeing that while it's nebulous _the entire point is ethnic identity for White Europeans_.

Then we have Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor rejecting that it's about racism, but agreeing that alt-right is about white european identity, and both do agree that white people are successful conquerors due to their superiority. Both are famous for their message of white supremacy, but if we need to litigate their history, feel free to whine in my reply box while doing literally 0 work yourself to educate yourself, assuming 0 responsibility for the state of your own learning

&gt;Alt-right was used but not coined by Richard Spencer. Check your facts, please.

It was Paul Gottfried, but his paleoconservative label doesn't make sense with the alt-right, it was Richard Spencer who popularized the term and 'coined' it's current usage between 2008-2010, from co-opting Paul's term to creating the Alternative Right blog.

So, alt-right as it is used today and what it stands for stems from Richard Spencers 2008 co-opting of the term and merging it with his openly White Nationalist (and coded white supremacist) work on his blog and at the National Policy Institute

I think it stands to reason that the alt-right and Richard Spencer (and a few others) are intertwined completely, and to divorce it from him is to reject the very thing that made it popular and mainstream. 

You cannot separate the popularized use of alt-right from Richard Spencer, and you cannot separate Richard Spencer from his canonical work on white supremacy.

In relation to the Old Norse language (which itself is a part of the Indo-European language family), its most conservative descendants are the Icelandic and Faroese languages.

&gt; The Cranberries is an alternative rock band from Limerick, Ireland that formed in 1989 and rose to mainstream popularity in the early 1990's. The band consists of Dolores O'Riordan (vocals, keyboards, guitars), Noel Hogan (guitars, vocals, also a member of Mono Band), Mike Hogan (bass, vocals), and Fergal Lawler (drums, percussion, also a member of The Low Network). The band went on hiatus in 2003 and reunited in the summer of 2009.

&gt; Combining the melodic jangle of post-The Smiths indie pop with the lilting, trance-inducing sonic textures of late-80s dream pop and adding a slight Celtic tint, The Cranberries became one of the more successful groups to emerge from the indie scene of the early 90s. Led by vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, whose keening, powerful voice is the most distinctive element of the group's sound, the group initially made little impact in the United Kingdom. 

&gt; It wasn't until the lush ballad ""Linger"" became an American hit in 1993 that the band also achieved mass success in the U.K. Following the success of ""Linger"", The Cranberries quickly became international stars, as both their 1993 debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, and its 1994 follow-up, No Need to Argue, sold millions of copies and produced a string of hit singles like ""Dreams"", ""Zombie"" and ""Ode to My Family"". 

&gt; By the time of their third album, 1996's To the Faithful Departed, the group had added distorted guitars to its sonic palette and attempted to make more socially significant music, which resulted in a downturn in the band's commercial fortunes.

&gt; During the next few years, the band cancelled a large tour and rumours of a breakup were widespread. In 1999, they released Bury the Hatchet to mixed reviews. In 2001, the band issued Wake Up and Smell the Coffee to rave reviews. The album debuted at number 46 in the US charts. 

&gt; In 2002, The Cranberries released the compilation Stars: The Best of 1992-2002, which was supported by the single ""Stars"".

&gt; In 2003, The Cranberries announced they were taking some time to pursue individual careers. They decided to put the next album on hold. After more than a dozen years of relentless touring and promotion, which had seen them clocking up album sales in excess of 43 million and playing to hundreds of thousands of fans around the globe, the band decided it was time for a break.

&gt; In 2007, Dolores O'Riordan released her debut solo album titled Are You Listening?. Two years later she released her second solo album, No Baggage.

&gt; On 25 August 2009, Dolores O'Riordan announced that The Cranberries will be reuniting for a North American tour to begin in mid-November 2009, to be followed by dates in Europe in early 2010. O'Riordan indicated that the band will be playing songs from her solo albums and a lot of The Cranberries classic hits as well as some new music written by the group together.

&gt; The Cranberries recorded Roses at the Metalworks Studios in Toronto (Canada) from 18 April to 15 May 2011 with producer Stephen Street, who previously collaborated with the band on first, second and fifth albums. The Cranberries worked on 15 tracks during the Roses session, although not all will be included on the album. The album is scheduled for release on 14 February, 2012.

moose8684,,,"This is such an ignorant, simple minded response.  The war was fought over federalism, specifically over the right of secession.  The southern states were using the same arguments that led to the war for independence from Britain.  They claimed that the States were sovereign entities that voluntarily formed the Union and could leave if the Federal government no longer represented the interests of the State.  The secession movement was the Brexit of its day.  They viewed the United States just as we view the EU today.  

The issue of who got to decide whether slavery was legal or not was the main reason that the Southern States decided to secede, but it was not why the war was fought.  Had the Southern States not seceded from the Union, slavery would likely have lasted for generations with no intervention.  The North would never have started a war to free the slaves, these were the same states that didn't even want slaves counted as people for representation purposes.  Lincoln himself even stated outright that the war was fought strictly to preserve the Union, and that the Emancipation Proclamation was simply a strategic move, which was made half way through the war mind you.  Lincoln even stared that blacks were subhuman and that they could never live harmoniously in white society.  

To make a statement like yours shows a complete ignorance of history.  It is no different than saying that WW1 was fought simply because a Serbian nationalist assassinated Franz Ferdinand.  It trivializes the issues that led to the conflict to a point that it becomes nonsensical.  Had Franz Ferdinand not been shot, WW1 might not have started exactly when it did, but it would have started regardless.  The same is true of the American Civil War.  Even if the South would have voluntarily freed all the slaves, the Civil War still would have been fought at some point because it was not fought to free slaves, slavery just happened to be the particular match that set the powder keg ablaze, just as Princeps's bullet did in Serejevo.

I am not defending the abhorrent practice of slavery.  I do not know what would make someone think that they could own another human being like cattle.  I would not oppose fighting a war to end such a practice, but this was simply not the case in Civil war.  To revise history the way we have is dishonest, and I believe the sole reason for it is to assign an altruistic motive to a bloody conflict.  Nobody wants to celebrate fighting a bloody war simply to preserve political power, so we tell ourselves it was some higher purpose to make ourselves feel good about it.  It is no different than going into Iraq for ""WMDs"" then when none turn up we are told, ""well we fought to liberate the Iraqi people from a brutal dictator"", because nobody wants to hear ""yeah we killed men, woman, and children so some rich guys could make a profit from the oil in the ground over there"".",True,0,1493672230,,False,0,dh01zzq,t3_68lutc,t1_dgzth51,1496175455,0,False,politics,t5_2cneq,

strolls,,,"&gt; And who are you to tell working class people who you've never spent a second walking in their shoes what is and isn't in their interests?

I started working at about the age of 15 - mowing a neighbour's lawn for long days all weekend, then litter-picking until after dark at the local Sunday market. I've worked in supermarkets, done agency work in factories and warehouses, the local bin collections and street sweeping. In my 20's I worked as a cycle- and motorcycle courier - I regularly worked exhausting 12-hour days and often did overtime on Saturdays and Sundays, too (not at overtime rates in that industry, though).

Frankly, you should aspire to better.

From a capitalist point of view, if someone with no qualifications, who doesn't even speak the language, can come over here and steal your job, then you deserve it.

Except that's economically illiterate, because immigrants don't steal jobs, they create them. There have been countless studies to this effect - that immigrants tend to take jobs which otherwise go unfilled, and then they boost the economy by spending their money here. Only the fittest come, in search of employment, so they don't tend to claim benefits. Cites: [1](https://infacts.org/mythbusts/eu-immigrants-arent-taking-brits-jobs/), [2](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-immigration-immigrants-jobs-brexit-remain-what-happens-unemployment-a7091566.html)

You're seeing your problems in the wrong place. Look at that lass who was interviewed in the pub - ""I put my all into my job - I work hard and I don't ask for handouts.""

Do you think Jacob Rees-Mogg and George Osborne give a fuck about that?

You working hard is all profit to the capitalists - they want you to give it your all, and they want to reduce regulations so that employers can work you harder and longer. That's what David Cameron meant when he said ""I'm not going to tax success"" - he wants more profits for investors who own the factory you work in (or the retailer or pub chain). When he said you should ""aspire harder"" he meant that you shouldn't work such shitty jobs if you expect more than a shitty wage.

The traditional working class made a virtue of labour, and it has not served them well.

Plenty of folks with your kinds of attitudes were happy to enjoy the benefits of Thatcherism - they took a big 40% or 60% discount on their council houses, thank you very much, now are happy to moan about the plight of the working class. We see that all over the UKIP constituencies, around Thanet, and amongst the Costa Del Sol retirees who voted for Brexit. 

The problems we see today are not caused by the EU or by refugees, but by wealth inequality - selling off our council houses and our public utility companies off to the highest bidder. That's tory_ideology.txt that is, so go off and vote for the cunts and see how bad you get it now they have unlimited power.

&gt;  Many of whom are incompatible with and outright hostile to British values (see the rape and pimping of nearly 3,000 vunerable white working girls by Muslim Pakistani street gangs in the small town which is Rotherham).

Rape by white people is ordinary - it happens every day, it is routine and it is commonplace. The number of 1,400 commonly cited for Rotherham occurred over a decade - for a town of that size it constitutes about 1/10 of the victims of rape occurring over that period.

Not only are you inflating the figures, but you don't really care about rape at all - you just want to talk about Pakistanis, and how they're ""incompatible with British values"". If there have been 12,600 rapes by white perpetrators in Rotherham in recent years, then the Pakistanis you detest would seem to be assimilating perfectly.

A. Citizens' rights 
12. 
The Agreement should safeguard the status and rights derived from Union law at 
the withdrawal date, including those the enjoyment of which will intervene at a later 
date (e.g. rights related to old age pensions) both for EU27 citizens residing (or 
having resided) and/or working (or having worked) in the United Kingdom and for 
United Kingdom citizens residing (or having resided) and/or working (or having 
worked) in one of the Member States of the EU27. Guarantees to that effect in the 
Agreement should be reciprocal, and should be based on the principle of equal 
treatment amongst EU27 citizens and equal treatment of EU27 citizens as compared 
to United Kingdom citizens, as set out in the relevant Union 
 acquis. 
 Those rights 
should be protected as directly enforceable vested rights for the life time of those 
concerned. 
13. 
The Agreement should cover at least the following elements: 
(a) 
Definition of the persons to be covered: 
the personal scope should be the same 
as that of Directive 2004/38 (both economically active, i.e. workers and self-
employed, and inactive persons, who have resided in the UK or EU27 before the 
withdrawal date, and their family members who accompany or join them at any 
point in time before/after the withdrawal date). In addition, the personal scope 
should include persons covered by Regulation 883/2004. 
(b) 
Definition of the rights to be protected: 
this definition should include at least 
the following rights: 
(i) 
the residence rights derived from Articles 21, 45 and 49 of the Treaty on 
the Functioning of the European Union and set out in Directive 2004/38 
(same material scope, covering 
inter alia 
the right of permanent 
residence after a continuous period of five years of legal residence) and 
the rules relating to those rights; any document to be issued in relation to 
the residence rights (for example, registration certificates, residence cards 
or certifying documents) should have a declaratory nature and be issued 
under a simple and swift procedure either free of charge or for a charge 
not exceeding that imposed on nationals for the issuing of similar 
documents. 
(ii) 
the rights and obligations set out in Regulation 883/2004 on the 
coordination of social security systems and in Regulation 987/2009 
3 
implementing Regulation 883/2004 (including future amendments of 
both Regulations) covering 
inter alia, 
rights to aggregation, export of 
benefits, and principle of single applicable law; 
(iii) 
the rights set out in Regulation 492/2011 on freedom of movement for 
workers within the Union (e.g. access to the labour market, to pursue an 
activity, social and tax advantages, training, housing, collective rights); 
(iv) 
the right to take up and pursue self-employment derived from Article 49 
of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 
14. 
For reasons of legal certainty, the Agreement should ensure, in the United 
Kingdom and in the EU27, 
the continued recognition of diplomas, certificates and 
other evidence of formal qualification 
obtained in any of the Union Member States 
before the withdrawal date, in accordance with Union law rules applicable before 
that date. It should also provide for arrangements relating to procedures for 
recognition which are ongoing on the withdrawal date.

The important part of that sentence is the word currently. Financial services must be the last industry Britain has any sway in.

 This is another thing I have trouble understanding. People have voted for change yet don't realise the change may be half the industry jumps to Dublin, Amsterdam, Barcelona or any of the mulititude of cities that would welcome them. 

Will Germans sell less cars? Probably, but why do we expect Germans to make rational decisions anymore than we have. They'll be thinking ""Britain needs our cars/sausages/christmas markets so they'll need to deal.""

That's fine, but I don't think we need to tear down our institutions of liberty in order to save America at this time.
