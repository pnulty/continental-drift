Depois criaram o PIS (que antes era o fim social) e também o Cofins.

Depois o PIS/Cofins Importação,  que apesar da semelhança no nome não tem nada a ver com o Pis/Cofins e é só mais um imposto aduaneiro.

Em seguida aumentaram a alíquota do Pis e da Cofins tornando ambos não-cumulativos. 

A essa altura já foram criadas várias contribuições que só são pagas somente pelas empresas. Eu nem falei das CIDES (contribuições sobre intervenção no domínio economico) que devem ser mais umas 8 contribuições diferentes.

And I'm not that exceptional. There are whole ethnic groups that are insulin resistant and have issues with bulk carbs. It's the metabolism for abut 15% of northern Europeans.

My best suggestions are to contact breeder referral from the GRCA web site, and go look at the [puppy listings on Facebook.] (https://www.facebook.com/groups/529036453775122/).

There are two Golden puppy listings groups, but one is way more European than the one I've linked above.

RanDomino5,,,"&gt; Islam in it's unreformed state promotes immoral views and practices, and those are practiced by the majority of countries under Islamic rule.

No, I don't see why that should be considered a uniquely Islamic thing.  The same things you're accusing Islam of, and worse, are present in plenty of non-Muslim places.  If anything, 'backwards' practices correlate more to poverty and being victims of imperialism.

&gt;I call the Islamic world 'backwards' because the majority of those countries have practices which are antithetical to morality and human rights, such as killing gays, transgenders and atheists, and having no women's rights, for example forcing them to wear the hijab, not allowing them to work, to vote, to drive (in some cases) and to even leave the house without a guardian.

Suddenly Western conservatives become feminists, lol.

&gt;These views are deeply ingrained in the population, and are based in the Quran.

No, those cultural practices are present in plenty of other places.  Even in the US until just a few years ago women were legally considered appendages of their husbands, for example.  To the point where even their names effectively became of the form ""Mrs. John Doe"" rather than whatever her name actually is.  Feminism is an extremely new concept in Europe and the US, so I don't think you have a lot of ground to throw stones.

&gt; notice how you don't see (the vast majority of) Christians practicing the parts of the Bible that call for gays to be killed, for instance.

What criteria are you using?  Many US states are controlled by theocrats who use homophobia and antifeminism as red meat for their base.  There's a massive movement to ban abortions in the US, to the point where they have murdered abortion doctors.

In full:


1) May had said she wanted to talk not just Brexit but also world problems; but in practice it fell to Juncker to propose one to discuss.

2) May has made clear to the Commission that she fully expects to be reelected as PM.

3) It is thought [in the Commission] that May wants to frustrate the daily business of the EU27, to improve her own negotiating position.

4) May seemed pissed off at Davis for regaling her dinner guests of his ECJ case against her data retention measures - three times.

5) EU side were astonished at May's suggestion that EU/UK expats issue could be sorted at EU Council meeting at the end of June.

6) Juncker objected to this timetable as way too optimistic given complexities, eg on rights to health care.

7) Juncker pulled two piles of paper from his bag: Croatia's EU entry deal, Canada's free trade deal. His point: Brexit will be v v complex.

8) May wanted to work through the Brexit talks in monthly, 4-day blocks; all confidential until the end of the process.

9) Commission said impossible to reconcile this with need to square off member states &amp; European Parliament, so documents must be published.

10) EU side felt May was seeing whole thing through rose-tinted-glasses. ""Let us make Brexit a success"" she told them.

11) Juncker countered that Britain will now be a third state, not even (like Turkey) in the customs union: ""Brexit cannot be a success"".

12) May seemed surprised by this and seemed to the EU side not to have been fully briefed.

13) She cited her own JHA opt-out negotiations as home sec as a model: a mutually useful agreement meaning lots on paper, little in reality.

14) May's reference to the JHA (justice and home affairs) opt-outs set off alarm signals for the EU side. This was what they had feared.

15) ie as home sec May opted out of EU measures (playing to UK audience) then opted back in, and wrongly thinks she can do same with Brexit

16) ""The more I hear, the more sceptical I become"" said Juncker (this was only half way through the dinner)

17) May then insisted to Juncker et al that UK owes EU no money because there is nothing to that effect in the treaties.

18) Her guests then informed her that the EU is not a golf club

19) Davis then objected that EU could not force a post-Brexit, post-ECJ UK to pay the bill. OK, said Juncker, then no trade deal.

20) ...leaving EU27 with UK's unpaid bills will involve national parliaments in process (a point that Berlin had made *repeatedly* before).

21) ""I leave Downing St ten times as sceptical as I was before"" Juncker told May as he left

22) Next morning at c7am Juncker called Merkel on her mobile, said May living in another galaxy &amp; totally deluding herself

23) Merkel quickly reworked her speech to Bundestag to include her now-famous ""some in Britain still have illusions"" comment

24) FAZ concludes: May in election mode &amp; playing to crowd, but what use is a big majority won by nurturing delusions of Brexit hardliners?

25) Juncker's team now think it more likely than not that Brexit talks will collapse &amp; hope Brits wake up to harsh realities in time.

26) What to make of it all? Obviously this leak is a highly tactical move by Commission. But contents deeply worrying for UK nonetheless.

27) The report points to major communications/briefing problems. Important messages from Berlin &amp; Brussels seem not to be getting through.

28) Presumably as a result, May seems to be labouring under some really rather fundamental misconceptions about Brexit &amp; the EU27.

29) Also clear that (as some of us have been warning for a while...) No 10 should expect every detail of the Brexit talks to leak.

30/30) Sorry for the long thread. And a reminder: full credit for all the above reporting on the May/Juncker dinner goes to the FAZ.

Alliance:

Now they're a beacon of neutrality against the Grand Star War of Walmart and North Korea. I honestly wish they had a proper standing Navy.

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — The pair of budding corruption fighters paused outside Slovakia’s presidential palace, trying to decide how long to give the government to capitulate to their demands. They wanted the resignations of the interior minister and the national police chief, as well as full and transparent investigations of a parade of recent corruption scandals. And that was just a start — the demonstration they had organized on Facebook was only a few hours away.


“What do you think, seven days?” asked David Straka, considering the memorandum he had put together with his partner, Karolina Farska.


She wasn’t sure. “We forgot to put in a deadline,” she said sheepishly, her face framed by a flowery headband. “This is the first time we’ve done anything like this.”


The oversight could be forgiven. They were, after all, just 18.


Corruption has been a stubborn problem in many of the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe. Things have grown so bad that some analysts now speak in terms of “state capture” — where all major state institutions are effectively in the hands of corrupt politicians and untouchable oligarchs. The problem is entering an even more critical stage, as authoritarian-minded leaders leverage the rise of nationalism and populism to consolidate power.


For young people like Mr. Straka and Ms. Farska, the fight against corruption is about nothing less than taking their country back for the next generation. Their battle is infused with a healthy dose of youthful idealism, but their anticorruption campaign has caught on, as have like-minded movements across the region.


The pair have become local media darlings, using Facebook to organize an anticorruption march in mid-April that drew as many as 10,000 people.


Immediately after the high schoolers dropped off their single-page manifesto at the government’s complaints office on the day of the march, they made their way through the baroque city center of Bratislava to a square where a few hundred people had already started gathering.


“The state should respect our parents and not steal from them and lie,” Mr. Straka explained without breaking step, as glowering clouds loomed over nearby Bratislava Castle and a steady sprinkle of icy droplets fell from the slate sky.


“I hope this doesn’t keep people away,” Mr. Straka said.


Ms. Farska was equally earnest, for good reason, she said.


“We are at the point in our lives when we are deciding what we want to do,” she explained. “Stay here in our own country with our families, or go abroad where we could have a good life without so much corruption.”


The quandary faces hundreds of thousands across the region, especially young people, who are turning disillusionment into determined action in countries like Poland, Macedonia, Serbia and others.


For nearly a full month in February, Romanians took to the streets to protest proposed laws that they felt would enable government corruption. A month later, protests against corruption that featured large numbers of young people erupted across Russia, too.


In Hungary, a group of people in their 20s formed a new political movement that forced the government to abandon its bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The protesters were fearful the event would provide a fertile ground for corruption.


Corruption is not the only target of the demonstrations. The protests are also driven by anger over fresh initiatives aimed at entrenching governing parties, serving the interests of oligarchs, weakening the rule of law, hobbling nongovernmental organizations and co-opting independent news media.


“Fighting corruption is really hard,” said Igor Matovic, a member of Slovakia’s Parliament whose small party was formed seven years ago to combat corruption. “They have all the power. They have all the money. But I will tell you one thing they fear, and that is students in the streets.”


That is something Mr. Straka and Ms. Farska understand. Their movement already has its own pop anthem: “The Deed Did Not Happen.”


The satirical title of the song, first performed by a band named Frendi, is taken from the verdict that ends many corruption investigations. “The deed did not happen, so it’s hard to prosecute the highest people,” the song begins.


Though Ms. Farska and Mr. Straska both come from Dubnica nad Vahom, a small town about 90 miles north of the capital with a population of 24,500, they attend different high schools: Ms. Farska goes to a school in their hometown, and Mr. Straka is in a special two-year program in Bratislava for gifted students.


“Then, by chance, we met up again about a year ago,” Ms. Farska said. “It turned out we had a lot in common.”


Their idea of trying to organize a young people’s protest movement against corruption came about slowly.


“When we came up with this idea, we thought we’d get maybe 200 people, including our friends and family,” Mr. Straka said. “You know, people who just want to show support so the whole thing didn’t become a big fail.”


But the idea took off. “In politics, there is no place for people who want to change things, only for those who want to steal,” Ms. Farska said.


The current government of Slovakia, led by Prime Minister Robert Fico, assumed power in 2012 largely on the heels of a huge government scandal.


The so-called Gorilla scandal, named after the code name given to a secret dossier, involved government officials, oligarchs and others caught on tape discussing kickbacks and other corrupt activities.


But the parade of scandals has not stopped. Even before the Gorilla scandal, during Mr. Fico’s first stint as prime minister in 2008, a lucrative contract to construct a toll system for the country’s highways slipped into controversy when it went to the highest bidder, a company whose true ownership was unclear, after the government declared three other bidders ineligible.


In 2012, shortly after Mr. Fico returned to power, a government-backed hospital was found to have paid over a half-million dollars more than a hospital in the neighboring Czech Republic did for a CT scan machine. And just last year, a close associate of the prime minister was named in a tax fraud scandal.


There are nightly protests outside the fashionable building on Castle Hill where the prime minister lives in an apartment for what opponents say is far below market price. His landlord is Ladislav Basternak, the same associate who benefited in the tax fraud case.


Nonetheless, Mr. Fico has tried to co-opt the corruption issue. With right-wing extremist parties gaining support, the prime minister has tried to portray his government as a champion in the fight against graft — going so far as to invite leaders of anticorruption organizations like Transparency International to meet with him for the first time.


“I want to assure all the citizens that the government of Slovakia views corruption as a serious, long-term problem and is taking concrete steps to limit and destroy it,” Mr. Fico said in a statement.


Ms. Farska and Mr. Straka are not persuaded. Neither, it seemed, were the thousands who ultimately showed up for their march on this recent day, despite the spitting rain.


People spilled out of trams, filling the square and its promenade. A couple of men in gorilla suits and long white beards — to indicate how long the Gorilla scandal has gone on — whooped and hopped and waved to the dumbstruck tourists.


“Stop corruption!” they chanted. “We are not oblivious!”


The rain intensified as the marchers made their way through the city’s narrow streets to SNP Square — named for the Slovak National Uprising against the Nazis and the site of the main anti-Communist protests during the 1989 Velvet Revolution — where a stage was wrapped in waterproof plastic.


Mr. Straka and Ms. Farska took the stage to raucous cheers.


“If this country is worth anything, these people must resign,” Mr. Straka said, waving a copy of the group’s demands. “The law is the same for everyone; otherwise, it makes no sense.”


Mr. Fico and most of his top ministers praised the democratic spirit of the students without addressing their demands. “It’s good when young people take an active interest in what is happening in their country,” the prime minister said in a statement after the rally.


Mr. Straka said they were still trying to figure out what to do if the government rejected their demands.


“People say we are naïve, and I guess we are naïve,” Ms. Farska said. “But we are learning, and we are not alone.”

I'm sure the Arab world would love to benefit from Israeli tech and also be able to say to their constituents that they're helping the Palestinians as well.

At the end of the day, while ""normalization"" between Israelis and Palestinians is a good way to help slow down and stop violence between the sides, the conflict is not likely to be solved in a single meeting of the minds (or even a single US presidency for that matter). The core issues like border lines/land swaps, Jerusalem, security (internal and external), settlements, Palestinian terrorism, water rights, etc. are not likely to be solved at any ONE point in the future. It's about establishing a ""Road Map"" for peace and building bridges between the cultures. At least bringing ordinary people together can assuage hard feelings between the sides.

Also on the topic of Palestinian city building you should look up Rawabi, a new development town/city in the West Bank. Palestinians have complete control of their civilian infrastructure in Area A where Rawabi is built, so it's not as if they NEED to build in Area C to satisfy their population growth. I understand it would be beneficial, but so would a lot of things...and I just don't think COGAT wants any more trouble in Area C than they already have with the EU and other international organizations funding illegal (and dangerous) structures.",True,0,1493608163,,False,0,dgz023f,t3_68j7qq,t3_68j7qq,1494518448,2,False,Israel,t5_2qhvo,

TwoBionicknees,,,"It doesn't, Arsenal bring in around 100mil in tv revenue and 100mil in match day revenue. However we and Utd stand miles above everyone else in that regard. We were around 50mil from Highbury but at the time we were easily the biggest London club, we were in europe, winning the league, one of the big two and we charged way more for tickets than everyone else.... still fucking do :(

I think Wigan's matchday income was something nuts like 7mil, I think most clubs, were in the 18-30mil range and I don't know what Spurs numbers are, I suspect probably somewhere around 45mil mark. 

In terms of spending habits, meh, some promoted clubs have had significant profits but the majority of promoted clubs get into a pretty heavy debt funding their promotion and so that can be a wash. Some clubs who got up spending sensibly can have a very low wage bill initially compared to their tv income, but they also tend to spend higher than your average bottom half prem side over the next few years trying to bring in a better quality player.

The vast majority of clubs get to the prem league then overspend to try to secure a long term place, most fail and end up with a big wage bill and a lot of players they can't sell on too large wages for the championship. 

One of the reasons a bigger stadium gives you a better position is precisely because if you can get a bigger slice from matchday money you can put yourself on a different level financially to other teams who can't afford to do that.

Spurs and Sunderland will get not drastically different amounts of cash for TV, or lets say Spurs and Southampton as they are closer. WHen Spurs tv income goes up, so does Southampton's. If Spurs get a new stadium and generate an extra 50mil in matchday income, that creates a new 50mil gap to Southampton that gives them a major advantage, or another way to look at it is those with smaller match day revenue are at a major disadvantage. 

If Spurs can increase income by 50mil a year via stadium, then they bridge half the gap to Arsenal's spending capability... in fact if we're out of the CL and Spurs are in the CL next year, the other half of the gap will be gone anyway.",True,0,1493608623,,False,0,dgz0cqj,t3_68gpli,t1_dgyzn8s,1494518591,4,False,soccer,t5_2qi58,

You mean the same way that we had to deal the the USSR for 70 years?

You mean the same US that has been continuously at war somewhere in the world for almost every single year since something like 1906? (And nearly always the aggressor.)

You mean the same way Australia sucked up to the murderous Indonesian dictator Suharto during the 1970s while he committed brutal atrocities in East Timor and Papua, stood by and let the Indonesian military murder in cold blood Australian citizens without even a whimper of protest?

You mean the way Australia supported the US illegal and unprovoked invasion of Iraq?

You mean the way the US is all cozy and friendly with murderous dictators all over the world?

In other words, politics as usual.

&gt; A war as part of a defensive alliance.

I already said that WW2 was the closest thing to a Just War I know of. That still doesn't mean that Aussie soldiers fought for our freedom. At *best* you can say that, just maybe, they fought for other people's freedom, in other parts of the world. But given that our allies included the very much unfree Soviets, the Chinese, the British Empire with their millions of colonial subjects, and others, it wasn't *much* freedom.

We fought so that the Philippines could go back to being ruled over by the Americans instead of the Japanese, so the Vietnamese would be ruled by the French instead of the Japanese, and to protect the Crown of the Empire, India, from being invaded.

And then we fought fought in Korea to defend a hated, unpopular dictator who was in the US's pocket, and in Vietnam to prevent Vietnamese independence, and in Malaysia to prevent Malaysian independence. Whose freedom were we fighting for then? We killed all those people, and they still eventually gained their independence.

&gt; a world with fascists at the helm would have an effect on everyone in it

Did I say it wouldn't have? Of course there would be an effect. Life for many people would have been nastier and crueler, and instead of the long Cold War between the US and USSR, we would have had... something else. Something different. Maybe a Cold War between Germany and the US. Who knows? What's your point? That still doesn't mean our soldiers fought for our freedom.

Tell me *one* freedom we gained because our troops went overseas to kill Asians, brown people or Germans.

&gt; put our factories and farms to work for them

That's a rather weird way to look at international trade. Do you think we ""put our farms to work"" for the Saudis because we sell them wheat? Or the Americans because we sell them beef? Or Japan because we sell them paper and iron?

Although now that you mention it, our trade agreements with the US are *terribly* one-sided, with the US getting a MUCH bigger benefit from us than we get from them. They didn't need to point any guns at us either, since our politicians in the Liberal Party know who the boss in the relationship is. That's how it works.

Of course history would have been different had the Axis won, and probably a lot worse for a lot of people, especially in Russia and Eastern Europe and China. But Australia's position would have been pretty much the same, regardless of who won. The details would have been different, but we'd still be ruled by a bunch of sycophants who put Australia's best interests secondary to those of whichever power holds the strings, be it the UK or US or Japan, while alternating between playing Holier Than Thou diplomatic games with some dictators and cozying up to others.",True,0,1493609789,,False,0,dgz13ac,t3_67kyk8,t1_dgybb2h,1496157680,1,False,australia,t5_2qh8e,

TOKYO — Asian shares were mostly higher Monday despite worries over regional tensions after a North Korea missile launch failed over the weekend.


KEEPING SCORE: Many markets in Asia and Europe were closed for Labor Day. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 0.4 percent in the morning session to 19,274.99. Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 was up nearly 0.1 percent to 5,927.60.


WALL STREET: U.S. stocks closed modestly lower Friday. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index slipped 4.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,384.20. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 40.82 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,940.51. The Nasdaq composite lost 1.33 points, or 0.02 percent, to 6,047.61.


NORTH KOREA: The failed attempt to launch a mid-range ballistic missile on Saturday added to regional uncertainty. President Donald Trump has warned that the U.S. “can’t allow” North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un to develop better missiles.


THE QUOTE: “The market mood remains relatively cautious ahead of a big news week that will include the French election and U.S. jobs data,” said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.


U.S. ECONOMY: U.S. jobs data are scheduled to be released later this week. The Labor Department said last week the U.S. economy turned in its weakest performance in three years in the January-March quarter, reflecting a slowdown in consumer spending. Growth, as measured by gross domestic product, amounted to 0.7 percent in the first quarter, less than what economists were expecting.


FRANCE FACTOR: A runoff election is set for Sunday for the French presidency between centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen. There are worries about growing nationalism.


ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 8 cents to $49.25 a barrel. It rose 36 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle late Friday at $49.33 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 16 cents to $51.89 a barrel in London.


CURRENCIES: The euro edged down to $1.0906 from $1.0924 late Friday in Asia. The dollar strengthened to 111.65 yen from 111.44 yen.

(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)


Good morning.


Here’s what you need to know:


• In France, blue-collar voters could determine if Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate, upends expectations in the presidential runoff on Sunday. Ms. Le Pen has capitalized on their disenchantment with pledges to impose “intelligent” protectionism.


Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the candidate of the extreme left who won nearly 20 percent of the first-round vote, called on his supporters to not vote for Ms. Le Pen. But Ms. Le Pen would also benefit if disillusioned voters in the poorer, largely immigrant suburbs of Paris, many of whom supported Mr. Mélenchon, abstained.


Ms. Le Pen said that she would name Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a Euroskeptic former rival, as her prime minister if she were elected. Emmanuel Macron, her centrist rival in the coming vote, visited two sites tied to France’s wartime history.


____


• Young people across Eastern Europe are increasingly protesting the consolidation of power among corrupt politicians and untouchable oligarchs.


In Slovakia, we met a pair of teenagers — Karolina Farska and David Straka — who have become unlikely media darlings with their anticorruption message.


“People say we are naïve, and I guess we are naïve,” Ms. Farska said. “But we are learning, and we are not alone.”


____


• Thousands of Russians gathered to present letters of protest at government offices, the second widespread show of public discontent in two months. Over a hundred people were arrested in St. Petersburg and in other cities.


“We have Putin, we don’t need food,” read one sarcastic protest sign in the Siberian city of Tomsk.


_____


• In Sweden, last month’s terror attack by an Uzbek man whose asylum claim had been rejected has some calling for a crackdown on illegal immigration, which in turn raised fears among rejected asylum seekers.


But the country is ill-equipped to deal with the challenge. The police estimate that 12,500 out of 18,000 rejected asylum seekers have gone underground. Sweden received 191,000 asylum applications in the last two years.


_____


• President Trump celebrated his first 100 days in office over the weekend, bathing in the applause of a crowd of his bedrock supporters and reviving falsehoods about the economy and the news media. Mr. Trump became the first sitting president since Ronald Reagan to address attendees of the National Rifle Association’s annual convention.


Congressional leaders reached a bipartisan agreement to fund the U.S. government through September, averting a shutdown next weekend.

• Chinese distant-water fishing vessels are heading to West Africa, where corruption and lax enforcement have opened the door to overfishing.

Today, the presidency of the U.N. Security Council changes hands.


That’s because the five permanent members and the 10 nonpermanent members each hold the role for one month, following English alphabetical order.


Sweden was up when the year started. Ukraine took February and the United Kingdom got March. The United States held April and now hands off to Uruguay.


Next month, the order starts back at the top: Bolivia, then China, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Italy and Japan.


This is just the second time that Uruguay, a U.N. founding member, has held a Security Council seat. The first, in 1965-66, came after a reorganization to increase representation by those who are not permanent members of the council.


Uruguay helped Singapore and a handful of other nations create the Forum of Small States, meant to allow small U.N. members to amplify their messages.


For May, Uruguay’s ambassador, Elbio Oscar Rosselli, above, organizes and speaks at meetings and sets schedules.


You could say that he is well named for the role of international diplomacy. “Oscar” spread across Europe and beyond thanks to the popularity of the epic works by the mid-18th century Scottish poet James Macpherson.


The name has two possible roots: from Gaelic, meaning “friend of deer,” or from Old English, meaning “sword of God.”

RanDomino5,,,"&gt; yes, it's not particularly old, but it's been going on for the best part of a century. That's still miles ahead of anything in the Islamic world.

Here's the thing.  The West *just* became civilized.  A century is nothing to be proud of.  There have been plenty of other temporary blips of civilization in the middle of centuries of empire and despotism.  Medieval Islam was the pinnacle of science and religious toleration for hundreds of years, and, yes, we're doing a little better than them in most ways, but only for a couple of decades (if we're being generous- judging the Europeans by the same standards as Muslims are judged would lump us all in with the British butchers of Kenya, which was 60 years ago).  Now we're already looking at a turn back to the dark ages with the rise of the far-right.  Let's give it, oh, another 200 years before we can start sucking our own collective dick.

&gt;The main reason being that the Islamic religion is unreformed and immoral.

This is just completely unsupported by any kind of serious understanding of history or global societies.  Even saying ""Islamic religion is"" displays an astounding level of ignorance of the many, many varieties of Islam and Islamic societies.  Are we lumping together Kurdish Sunnis, Syrian Druze, Salafis, Pakistanis, and Sufis, for starters?  Are we including every sect and tendency through 1400 years of Islamic history?

Regardless of the quality of the food we manage to cook up we still have to clean the entire kitchen 3 times a day after every cooking session no slacking!

EU is not supposed to make your life better is supposed to guarantee you that IF YOU WORK towards your happiness that is exactly what is going to happen. 

When i say ""you work"" is not ment just in the literal sense of doing a job is actively pursuing the things that make you happy and finding a way to make a living out of it.

I grew up and live in a very textbook liberal area, where I would be called a racist in Middle School for saying that my favorite color is black (no, seriously) or get told that my ancestors were slave owners. Hell, I even once mentioned how socialism isn't exactly communism, and I was already called a Nazi. My ancestors and parents were all from Eastern Europe (some were moderate Jewish too), so they have nothing to do with what went on this country or Nazi Germany and I would get kind of frustrated, but I just laugh at it now. Most of those kids stay in the same city, while I got the chance to go to many different countries, learn new languages, speak to different people and learn new perspectives.

I learn many new things from keeping an open mind, while my closed minded classmates stay on the same level. All this only made me feel bad for them and for humanity. And I'm not referring to only blacks or other races. I took a Political Science class (which I also regret) and most the classmates who speak all the time are white liberals who copy off everything that the TV says.

Predator-Fury,,,"If we are going to attribute the Mongols to the growth of European intellectualism and the Renaissance, then I would say that has a lot more to do with the spread of Chinese and Muslim technologies  and ideas to Europe through the Mongols which gave the Europeans and edge rather than any destruction of the aforementioned civilizations. Keep in mind a lot of Muslim advances and philosophy itself were derived from Classical Greece and Rome too. Not to mention the dark ages aren't as dark as people make them out to be especially if you don't ignore things like the Carolingian Renaissance or what was going on in the Byzantine Empire. If anything I'd argue that the Mongols probably stunted Europe albeit unknowingly with the Black Death taking so many lives. The Ottomans made many advances especially in terms of militarily and had many scientists like Taqi-al Din and Ali Qushiji discovering or inventing things. While we are at it lets not forget the Indian subcontinent which while not the Middle East was still under Muslim rule at the time and made advances as well.  Also you are wrong about Chinese development stopping after Song. The Yuan would still continued to support and give patronage to Chinese Mathematicians and scientists like Guo Shuojing and the Ming had plenty such as Zhu Zaiyu and Xu Guangqi. It's only under the Qing in which what we call the Great Divergence really took place for reasons I will mention next.

The reason I talk geopolitics because that is what I believe plays the biggest factor in the West's dominance.  As you mentioned the discovery and subsequent exploitation of the New World plays a tremendous factor in the West's dominance and came as a result of Europe's attempt to reconnect with China and India following the collapse of the Yuan Dynasty. Most important however is the fact that _competition_ is what really drove Europe to develop. Following the collapse of Rome, European countries was always embroiled themselves in conflicts and intrigues with one another which forced them to invent and innovate. Those who stagnated didn't survive or were subjugated or exploited by others. Its a lot different in the East. The Song Dynasty was inventive because it was always on the verge of being conquered by it's northern neighbors whether they be the Liao, Jin or Yuan much like European nation states were with each other. In contrast Qing China had complete dominance of East Asia, Central Asia and South East Asia in ways which no other Chinese dynasty ever had, which is why they stagnated since there was no motivation to develop further. Similarly the Ottoman Empire while it didn't stagnate as much as the Qing did, fell behind their European rivals in the late 17th century because for nearly three centuries  they always had the upper hand in it's conflicts and nobody really challenged them except for the Persians who they mostly dominated until Nader Shah in the 18th century.

So yes while I agree the rest of the world did stagnate allowing Europe to dominate, I would say it has to do with much more important factors than the destruction caused by the Mongols.",True,0,1493612897,,1493613416,0,dgz2vjn,t3_68fmij,t1_dgyylzo,1496158537,3,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,

&gt; I'm not changing the goalposts, I'm pointing out a flaw in the analogy between the Mafia and the US.

Your original argument is that you can leave the jurisdiction of the state, therefore remaining is consent to whatever the state does (or whatever mystical limit you put on ""voluntary."") You then claim that it's not just that one can leave, but also that one can, if he is enfranchised, either occasionally vote for some choices the state gives him or even attempt to win an office within the state. You've added more criteria, which is moving the goal posts. 

So, how does democracy make it voluntary, versus non-democracy if, in both cases, the person has the option to leave the jurisdiction of those who claim to have power over him?

&gt; A second perhaps clearer flaw for you is that the shop owner doesn't own the shop in the US free and clear and only built the shop knowing it was subject to taxes. 

That doesn't mean he consents, it only means that's what he puts up with in order to create the sort of lifestyle he's looking for. 

&gt; There's a buried equivocation that a shop owner in the US is parallel to a shop owner somewhere where the Mafia operates, or a shop owner in the state of nature when they're not. The shop owner likely didn't build the shop knowing he had to pay the mafia as well as the State, there isn't the same prior consent we have here, and there isn't a second more powerful leviathan that is supposed to protect the shop owner from the mafia.

If he knew that the mafia operated in that neighborhood, would it then be voluntary?  When I moved to Eastern Europe, I helped setup a business with my friend there. Part of that was working at a train station, and we had to pay the local mafia there for the privilege. Was that, then, voluntary? The government considered it illegal, but did nothing to stop it (I'm still not sure that they've done anything.)

This is an old Simpson 260 multimeter I inherited. Still in it's original box complete with the manual. It even had the US made stock batteries in it (I am from Europe). The batteries were long gone but it seems they only left little damage.


It seems these are quite popular: http://simpson260.com/260-3/simpson_260-3.htm has a lot of information on my model. My unit is stamped 12/60, so it is now almost 57 years old.


As you can see, it's a real beauty. I don't really need another multimeter but I'd like to restore this one to it's original functioning state anyway. I didn't put in new batteries yet as I don't really trust those resistors anymore and I think I saw two capacitors too. Any hints on what to do except replacing all caps/resistors? I hope I find all those exact values...

Edit: I just saw that the unit itself seems to be the model 270 series 1 although the box and the manual say 260 series 3.

pilotavery,,,"I'm sure radios are going to die pretty soon, but I don't think it's ready yet. Most cars still have radios, and only newer cars are starting to come without radio. I can imagine in about 50 years, the traditional FM radio won't be around anymore, with going to digital, like television, or more likely being purely reserved for emergency and military broadcasting. Currently, the FM radio, along with the digital television, are used for emergency broadcasts. 

That wasn't so much my argument, as much as using it for public internet. That frequency is useless for short range, and is only useful for long range, very low bandwidth broadcast, either audio, or simple text transmission. Most low frequencies are for audio, stuff like CB radio, air traffic control, and other long range audio broadcasting. And until there is a need for other audio, there isn't really a point. Nobody else can benefit from that bandwidth, other than amature radio operators, air traffic control (who really needs it, I would know, some airports use frequencies shared with other airports, and the two airports have to share one radio frequency.)
But part of it is that the equipment is designed for slightly higher frequencies. Around 110mhz to 130mhz. And so you'd have to replace the radios with new ones, and they cost $25,000 on larger airplanes for just the radio stack equipment, and most have two. 

The only people who can benefit from it are audio operators, and right now, it's balanced. It's a good market, people still listen to radio for news, people still use the radio for emergency alerts, etc.

Once the older generation ages out in 50 years, you're right, it will be dead. But it's not for the same reason over the air television isn't, because some people live off grid, some people still need information and alerts, and some people don't have a permanent home, and some don't have money to pay for cable. Just like not everyone has a smartphone, or the ability to even use their streaming on their car. Before public WiFi goes live, I think cheaper cell service, or free mobile internet will be standard, like it is in Europe. The last problem is backhaul. If there were a major emergency, like a nuclear strike, an earthquake, or emp blast from the sun, cell communications are fragile, suceptible to major congestion, and this means emergency alerts can't be used. Plus, cell phones are not typically powered by alkaline batteries, nor last long enough for emergencies yet. The AM and FM radios work at much lower power, much longer range, and can be used even with a very low signal to noise ratio. 

It makes sense to get rid of it in the future, but 5 other things need to happen first for the benefits to balance the downsides. Because reusing the frequencies for data would be more expensive than just using unlicensed, even if it was free. They just don't work, from an engineering perspective. If there is a better use for them, which there isn't yet, AND that outweighs the cost, then maybe. 

Lastly, it won't benefit anyone now, because even if that spectrum was made available, who is going to deploy thousands of micro cells? Basically it would be a new type of cell network. GSM, CDMA, and then now a new standard. It's better to use existing standards, use some more mid spectrum for that, so ease the congestion..It's a congested subscription, if it's going to be free, it's going to need to have MUCH more spectrum. There are 50 better solution than using FM spectrum for internet.

WandersFar,,,"That sounds a lot like my experience, too. Made a lot of European friends plus the other Americans in my program, but socialized slim to none with native Swedes other than my really kind and welcoming host family.

That’s not to say Swedes aren’t nice, because they really can be. Little things, like one time I was waiting my turn in a bank and doing my Swedish homework on line and muttering to myself, and the random guy next to me helped me out. The word was kvällstidningen. :)

Or I was flying to Italy on a mini-break and when I got near to the end of the line they had that little weight / size basket to measure your carry-on against and I was over.

Anyway, this sweet Swedish couple behind me in line saw what my issue was and they offered to sneak my stuff into their bags. You probably couldn’t get away with that kind of thing nowadays, and I was kind of shocked they’d let me do it then, with how security is in the States, and you know, I’m a perfect stranger. But they were super nice about it and saved me a lot of headache. Some Swedes also helped me when I was in France and got lost.

kayjaylayray,,,"Acknowledging the past only keeps ancient hatreds alive. There should be absolutely no reparations because that is redistribution of wealth and racism. There should be no racial groups that are for a certain group. This keeps people angry and draws on the past.

The problem is that the past is blurry and written by nefarious people. For example, white people get blamed for slavery yet it was the blacks and jews who were running and selling slaves and almost no white people owned or dealt in slaves. In fact, it was white people who were also the victim of the Muslim Caliphate that lasted for almost a thousand years and this is the reason why white people helped restore Christianity to the middle-East after Islam destroyed it and pushed it into Europe out of Palestine. It was the white people of Britain and America that freed the slaves after being very new to the slave trade and only participated in it for a brief time and at a minimum compared to South and Central America. Only 7% of white people owned slaves in America. Most of them toiled on their own land. This is a misdirection created by the wealthy to pin the blame on the middle-class. So you see, acknowledging the past doesn't mean a thing when you're acknowledging propaganda and lies.

Yes there was genocide, but there has been genocide and murder and war all over the planet and it isn't monopolized by anyone except the banks who fund both sides and profit off of it. The multinational companies that champion it when they need something. Putting it on the laps of the chattel does no good at all.

The thing is, multiculturalism is a failure. It was doomed from the start because it was an invention of socialist jews and their cultural Marxist lap-dogs. There is absolutely no reason to force people together except to divide them. They claim people are being brought together and coming together. This is wrong. All that is happening is that people with different values and languages and beliefs are being forced to interact at some trivial level in order to create tension.

There are a few factors of multiculturalism. 1) Divide the population. They do this by putting them at each others throats. Mixing groups today is an extension of the old world management of splitting nations into smaller nations and moving borders around to isolate people and force them into a new situation. 2) Destroy the voting power of the populous. They do this by encouraging multiculturalism. When you immigrate people, each immigrant is 1 less vote for the locals. This allows them to run liberal government that do the bidding of their multinational corporations. And they want this because 3) Lower the wages of a nation. A nation with poor people being brought in will have their wages lowered and jobs taken. They won't be able to form unions. 4) Replace the culture. A cultureless country that pretends to be multicultural is the result. Mixed cultures that all keep to themselves in enclaves that never really care about each other and never really mix divides the country. This eventually reduces the power of community in the nation. Once there is no majority, and the nation is just minorities, they have no power to keep the government and corporations in check.

forbes-bot,,,"**France, Russia, Donald Trump: Your Monday Briefing**




(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)


Good morning.


Here’s what you need to know:


• In France, blue-collar voters could determine if Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate, upends expectations in the presidential runoff on Sunday. Ms. Le Pen has capitalized on their disenchantment with pledges to impose “intelligent” protectionism.


Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the candidate of the extreme left who won nearly 20 percent of the first-round vote, called on his supporters to not vote for Ms. Le Pen. But Ms. Le Pen would also benefit if disillusioned voters in the poorer, largely immigrant suburbs of Paris, many of whom supported Mr. Mélenchon, abstained.


Ms. Le Pen said that she would name Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a euroskeptic former rival, as her prime minister if she were elected. Emmanuel Macron, her centrist rival in the coming vote, visited a Holocaust memorial.


____


• Young people across Eastern Europe are increasingly protesting the consolidation of power among corrupt politicians and untouchable oligarchs.


In Slovakia, we met a pair of teenagers — Karolina Farska and David Straka — who have become unlikely media darlings with their anticorruption message.


“People say we are naïve, and I guess we are naïve,” Ms. Farska said. “But we are learning, and we are not alone.”


____


• Thousands of Russians gathered to present letters of protest at government offices, the second widespread show of public discontent in two months. Over a hundred people were arrested in St. Petersburg and in other cities.


“We have Putin, we don’t need food,” read one sarcastic protest sign in the Siberian city of Tomsk.


_____


• In Sweden, last month’s terror attack by an Uzbek man whose asylum claim had been rejected has some calling for a crackdown on illegal immigration, which in turn raised fears among rejected asylum seekers.


But the country is struggling to deal with the challenge. The police estimate that 12,500 out of 18,000 rejected asylum seekers have gone underground. Sweden received 191,000 asylum applications in the last two years.


_____


• President Trump celebrated his first 100 days in office over the weekend, bathing in the applause of a crowd of his bedrock supporters and reviving falsehoods about the economy and the news media.


Separately, Mr. Trump became the first sitting president since Ronald Reagan to speak at the National Rifle Association’s annual convention.


Congressional leaders reached a bipartisan agreement to fund the U.S. government through September, averting a shutdown next weekend.


_____


• Chinese distant-water fishing vessels are heading to West Africa, where corruption and lax enforcement have opened the door to overfishing.


• We spoke with five people who have been training artificial intelligence to replace them in doing their jobs.


• “Fit and proper” — Our media columnist looks into the regulatory standard that is haunting the Murdoch family’s bid to gain complete control of the Sky satellite and cable network.


• Ahead this week: Apple and Volkswagen earnings; the Federal Reserve’s decision on whether to raise interest rates on Wednesday.


• Key markets are closed for the Labor Day holiday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets.


• European Union leaders unanimously endorsed guidelines to negotiate the end of more than four decades of British membership in the bloc. [The New York Times]


• The Turkish government expanded its crackdown on free expression, purging nearly 4,000 more public officials, blocking access to Wikipedia and even banning television matchmaking shows. [The New York Times]


• An exiled Iranian television executive was assassinated by unknown assailants in Istanbul. [The New York Times]


• In North Korea, a limited embrace of market forces is a risky gamble for Kim Jong-un, the country’s leader, eroding the cult of personality surrounding him. [The New York Times]


• Matteo Renzi, Italy’s former prime minister, easily won a Democratic Party primary, a key step in his bid to return to power. [Politico]


• Ueli Steck, a renowned mountain climber known as the Swiss Machine, was killed in a mountaineering accident near Mount Everest. [The New York Times]


• Read a book you think you’ll hate, and you’ll become a better critic.


• Be nice, and don’t worry about the cool kids — research says you won’t finish last.


• Recipe of the day: Celebrate the season with pasta primavera.


• Chelsea will almost surely be the Premier League champion, largely thanks to its ruthless tactics under its manager, Antonio Conte.


• Maria Sharapova lost in the semifinals of the Porsche Grand Prix to Kristina Mladenovic, one of her biggest critics.


• Ben Brantley, our chief theater critic, is reporting from the West End in London this week.


In his latest review, of the musical “Dreamgirls,” he writes that “the show comes roaring at you like a souped-up, chrome-plated luxury sedan.”


Today, the presidency of the U.N. Security Council changes hands.


That’s because the five permanent members and the 10 nonpermanent members each hold the role for one month, following English alphabetical order.


Sweden was up when the year started. Ukraine took February and the United Kingdom got March. The United States held April and now hands off to Uruguay.


Next month, the order starts back at the top: Bolivia, then China, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Italy and Japan.


This is just the second time that Uruguay, a U.N. founding member, has held a Security Council seat. The first, in 1965-66, came after a reorganization to increase representation by those who are not permanent members of the council.


Uruguay helped Singapore and a handful of other nations create the Forum of Small States, meant to allow small U.N. members to amplify their messages.


For May, Uruguay’s ambassador, Elbio Oscar Rosselli, above, organizes and speaks at meetings and sets schedules.


You could say that he is well named for the role of international diplomacy. “Oscar” spread across Europe and beyond thanks to the popularity of the epic works by the mid-18th century Scottish poet James Macpherson.


The name has two possible roots: from Gaelic, meaning “friend of deer,” or from Old English, meaning “sword of God.”


Lauren Hard contributed reporting.

sasgraffiti,,,"I'm gonna answer your last bit first. You just can't decide an opinion on a big matter and just hold it solid, no matter what. If you don't submit it to revision and opposing opinions, then you don't have an opinion, you just have religion.

You are completely missing the point. First of all, you can't just declare 'because it is just beginning, we should dismantle their nuclear program' We who? Of course a nuclear program is horrible but for the love of god stop this hipocrisy. You are well aware of the US arsenal and yet you are more concerned about NK? Especially since there is something you can do. If you, as people, get together, then you could do something. You, as the US can't and shouldn't do anything about NK because it is a violation of sovereignity. Do you think it would be OK if any country threatened the US because they are a threat to the world (and of course they are)?

Yes, diplomatic actions are due, but who on earth would accept to dismantle all of their defenses and let the big guy get away with all of theirs? And who is the US to declare what is going on in NK? Because the story of the mad leader and the starving people and shit is just shit propaganda, a war propaganda. [Here](https://anti-imperialism.org/2014/08/14/western-dprk-propaganda-the-worst-occasionally-hilarious-and-often-racist-lies/) is just about the hyperbolic shit the Western media sells, but if that gets accepted, how easily could they sell you ""they put their people to hunger and death"" or ""they work 654654654 hours a day"" or any other shit. 

If people are really concerned about humanity and world stability, then lets point our fingers, pens and megafones to the ones who perpetrate the destruction: the US, the EU, UN and Russia (and of course they have other countries under their control). If you are aware the US has a 700x larger nuclear programme then how do you get scandalized over NK?

And on the other hand, if people would have been opressed for THAT long, they would've already revolted. NO revolution has ever been brought by the US. People revolt and revolution when they have to. No amount of indoctrination will ever stop the people's power. So please, see the other side of the coin. Check the history and see how it repeats again.

RazRaptre,,,"I think that you're going by the assumption that after the war's over, the Free and Liberal West can drop boxes of Freedom over these countries and then dust their hands and go back to enjoying Lady Liberty. 

Here's the problem with that, though. Let's assume for simplicity's sake that all of Europe supported the US (let's call this alliance 'The West') in an actual war on Islam. That makes up all your allies. The US interfering with and destroying other cultures would make S.Americans feel VERY sympathetic towards Muslims. At *best*, Russia will not engage in direct war but will supply weapons to anyone working against The West, because a broken destabilized Europe is perfect for them.

Now, what about China, Japan and Korea? I'll be honest, I'm not sure where they'd lean in the event of a conflict like this. While they're not exactly fond of Islam (or any of the Abrahamic religions) they most certainly won't want to be embroiled in a culture war that they have no part of.

Fast forward a couple of decades. Europe is pseudo-Russia, South America has been set back several decades, the Middle East, North Africa and half of Asia is either back in the stone age or is a glassed wasteland. MURICA WON THE WAR, FREEDOM YAY - except China and Russia have both overtaken a weary and exhausted US on the world stage. 

In the event of a war on a religion, I'd also expect Christianity to come back full force in the US. And with it, a lot of the same outdated views that a war on Islam tried to get rid of, will resurface. Abortion = murder. Got raped? Marry him. Slavery = fact of life.

IMO, a war is going to be horrible for everyone and will just set humanity back a couple hundred years. The current situation is perfect. Saudi Arabia and most Muslim countries are reforming, fast.

powderizedbookworm,,,"I do understand where you’re coming from, but there are plenty of people who consider themselves big Velvet Underground fans, despite not having listened to everything they could find.

When I was in high school, my mom used to love to make me go to church on sunday, more as a way to exert some control over me more than anything. Sometimes I would go, sometimes I’d just drive around town, sometimes I’d get breakfast. But I’d always listen to “Sunday Morning.” I liked that first line “Sunday Morning/Praise the dawn in.” It took the edge off the annoyance and anger, and it made me feel the light and possibility of the years ahead.

I didn’t always listen to the album straight through, but between my Sunday morning sessions and just pulling it out to listen, I would say that there were a couple years where I listened to it every couple weeks (sometimes skipping European Son).

Years later, I would fall in love with a girl at a summer internship. Months of maybe/maybe not later, I visited her at her college. One of her good friends there was very into music, and I got the impression that our mutual love of The Velvet Underground and Nico brought him out of his shell more than he usually did around new people, even though my favorite was the fairly pastichey Sunday Morning (still is), and his was Heroin.

I wasn’t quite sure where I stood when I left her, she was a bit cagey, and I was terrifyingly in love. I listened to that album on the way home, and when I got to “I’ll Be Your Mirror” I put it on repeat for a few listens. That laid back little guitar line, the jangly rhythm section, and that line “Please put down your hands/Cause I see you/I’ll be your mirror…” 

She broke up with me a couple days later, but I would have been her mirror forever. I have never been more devastated, and five years later, I still haven’t fallen in love again. Cue John Cale’s apocalyptic viola from “Black Angel…”.

Largely due to that breakup, I ended college sitting on the edge of depression. I moved back home. Once again, my mom seemed to get a kick out of making me go to church on sundays (and more charitably, knew it was good for me to get out of the house). And once again, I’d drive around in the clear, cold Teton mornings with Sunday Morning playing.

I felt like I’d failed the most important trial of my life, and that due to not being charming, or confident, or *something* enough, my life would always be noticeably empty. I held on to that line about “the wasted years/so close behind,” comforted by the fact that someone understood what I was feeling. All the streets I’d crossed, not so long ago, haunted me then (and still do, even though it is so long ago since I’ve crossed them now...). It’s all the more bitter for how much the song also reminds me of youthful optimism and energy.

“Sunday Morning, and I’m falling/I’ve got a feeling, I don’t want to know”

Texas decided to invade the US, because after failing to gain independence in 2175, they decided to do it themselves. The reason they wanted independence is because a massive oil reserve was found in Texas in 2160 and they feel that the United States is simply taking something that could make them an extremely rich nation. 


ISIS(Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) is the same islamic state in my setting. ISIS, who have lived without conflict for a few decades, send soldiers to help Texas gain independence, and then they help them in their expansion. At first Sunni and Shia didn't coexist peacefully with many riots and killings, but with time and the threat  of execution(When the riots started the Islamic State imposed Martial law) the two factions began to join and many of their ideals were mixed together and people began to see little difference between the two. Of course there are still extremist that hate the other on both sides and small scale riots still break out, but mostly, its peaceful.


Pakistan asked China to send soldiers after a small conflict with India since they felt India might retaliate on a larger scale.

Unfortunately whilst the majority of the bikers were very anti nazi beingfor the most part people who had served a trend repeated in Vietnam. A minority seem to have gone 'if i dress and look like a biker i can wear all this stuff i own from my mastabatory fantasies about Hitler winning in PUBLIC awesome!!1!1!1!' I am of course paraphrasing because i cant get the inbred sisterfucking gormless accent of the mouth breathing average Neo Nazi to appear in text.

The bikers did it for fear the links did it to shock hence things like people performing in SS officers caps and stuff but the minority using it as an excuse to shout Sieg Heil and do that dance that swept across Europe in their parents generation the GooseStep unironically and because punk was broadly speaking a backlash against a political system they felt was staid and out of date with its outnoded concept of Dulce Est decorum Est empire and the stiff upper lip it became a new means of political discourse.


So you had the links who believed the best way to rebel against the British establishment was to be a communist/socialist and you had some viewing fascism was the answer which is weird since one of the Main things they were rebelling against was this idea of British red and national identity. You had the battle lines being drawn in gigs with gangs of either side smacking shit out of each other but also within bands. The Ramones are the best example with the Singer being a communist and the bass player being a fascist. The singer writing a anti right wing song (the kkk took my baby away) to annoy the bass player. 

With the metal crowd having their whole image and look coming for. The biker crowd its where songs like fairys wear boots come from as Ozzy got a shoeing from some links when pissed up one night as they went out 'nazi bashing'

It's kind of where antifa came from they came from the punk anti nazi movement and just like last time the same thing is happening why the antifascist league fell apart in the 90's early 200's in the UK because it got hijacked by political extremists of one flavour (in England being the SWP) and the definition of Nazi became less 'a supportor of a Socialist State where the government controlled industry via government owned corporations with a culture and belief that the nation mattered more than the individual (paraphrased definition) and more about 'this guy disagrees with me so he's a nazi and i'mma kick fuck out of him'

This means India, Africa and all of East Asia and all the Middle East region.

You might ask yourself why. 

The allied nations never honoured any of their agreements.

A few off my head are the Balfour Declaration where the Arab tribes fought for the allied powers yet were not given what they were promised their homeland.

Again in 1919 when China came to the aid of the Allied powers with 200,000 labourers. Again this was to get Shandong back. This was also not honoured. This led directly to the rise of the communist party. Exactly the same happened after WW2. All non whites who came to England to work in the arms factories were deported at gun point.

India too fought to get independence. They too did not get what they were promised. In WW2 the bastard Churchill even subjected India to a man made famine EVEN THOUGH India provided millions of troops. The Indian contribution is not recognised there is what one memorial to them in England. The UK then subjected India to a partition killing millions more.

Then consider the US. Non whites were not even considered humans until 1965 what with all the unfair literacy tests preventing their franchise. The US is and was a white supremacist nation Jim Crow laws, Chinese exclusion act, internment, the post WW2 mass arrest of Chinese without trial. Look at Jessie Owens about his comments about going to Berlin for the Olympics. He thought FDR treated him worse.





At the very least Africa, India, the Middle East and Asia should have simply let the European powers destroy each other. It wasn't our war it was nothing to do with us. The European powers should have fought it out amongst themselves.




Look at the USA today. Dylan Roof is considered to be a hero. You have a president who took white supremacists off the FBI watch list. You STILL have massive segregation, you still have massive inequality and massive racism against non whites.

Just look at the Vietnam war where rape and murder were completely acceptable. Where the Mai Lai massacre was APPROVED and condoned by the US military. 



Fuck man look at TODAY. Where white people think it's OK to go to Asia be assholes attack people even rape (Okinawa US military has a rape rate of 2400 per 100,000 vs the native rate of 21 per 100,000) and US citizens think it's ok because we're not human apparently.

Ja klar, unser BIP steigt auch.

&gt; Wo wuerdest du die Grenze ziehen?

Auf jeden Fall noch nicht jetzt.

&gt; Dann musst du aber auch auf den Zeitraum schauen. 1970 war das effektive Pensionsantrittsalter 65 Jahre fuer Maenner. Heute ist es bei 58.4. 1970 warst du im Schnitt 6 Jahre in der Pension, heute bist du 30 Jahre in Pension. Das war eine nicht geplante Verlaengerung der Pensionsdauer und so nie beabsichtigt. Es gibt Leute die heute in Pension gehen auf dem alten Pensionsmodell die laenger in Pension sein werden als sie gearbeitet haben.

Ok. Und jetzt?

&gt; Das zitierte Papier spricht von ""Schon jetzt werden aus dem Bundesbudget knapp zehn Milliarden Euro pro Jahr in das Pensionssystem gepumpt"". Das BMF sagt Zuschuesse 2014 ""10,2 Mrd. Euro"" und 2015 ""10,7 Mrd. Euro"". Wo siehst du die 25% Deckungsquote im verlinkten PDF?

Seite 24 unten. Zum Vergleich: Die Lohnsumme der unselbstständig Beschäftigten liegt bei über 106 Mrd. Euro, macht bei 22,8% Beitrag ca. 24,1 Mrd. Euro Einnahmen. Das ist etwa das Zweieinhalbfache.

&gt; Habe nie von Beamtenpensionen gesprochen.

Ja, deswegen ""vorher"".


&gt; Wie definierst du ""nicht 'zu teuer'""? Weil wenn wir nur nach Eurostat Zahlen gehen schaut das System schon sehr teuer aus (und das ist der status quo und keine Projektion): http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/f/fc/Total_annual_pension_expenditure_per_beneficiary_for_old-age_pensions%2C_EU-28%2C_2013_%28in_EUR_and_PPS%29.png

The best case scenario was that you got a benign-ish wake up call pretty early (i.e. Japan) and ended up playing the Westernization game any way. Worst case scenario you were ignored until it was far too late to start playing (i.e. Tibet). The countries that succeeded the best at being uncolonized nations, were the ones that knew how to balance competing powers against each other, countries that knew when to fight and when to back down. Thailand and Bhutan are probably the best examples. 

&gt; I think the more important question to answer is why each kingdom was isolated in the first place.

Geography almost always has some hand in it. Tibet, Korea, Japan, and China all were on the far side of the world, and fell open to the world in descending order, with the winners (by today's standards) being the ones that opened first, and arguably lost the most (by their contemporary standards). But plain ol' religio-philosophical reasons (i.e. Confucian, Shinto, and Buddhist values) had as much to do with them. Europe's Christian philosophy and ""Divine Right of Kings"" had as much influence, but the growth of Capitalist economies, the development of the Social Contract, and finally the Enlightenment and age of Revolutions, undermined and finally destroyed the old monarchies. Asian countries had comparable movements, organizations, and challenges to their old systems, but they never quite reached the level of Europe's, until the 20th Century for the most part. 

&gt; I wonder what would have been needed to turn India into an isolationist kingdom. Imagine if the the English didn't coerce the Indian princes into globalism.

A United India would be needed at the very least. One of the reasons the British Raj rose in the first place was because the Mughals were on their way out. Alternate History is strictly prohibited from this sub, so suffice to say that the Marathas were the most significant challenger to the Mughals that weren't British. 

Though the Indians didn't all get coerced into globalization, many resisted... and then were destroyed. As I said above, many of the subcontinent's princes knew when to fight and when to compromise. Bhutan and Nepal are probably the best examples of ""Indian"" princes who fought against the British when they were able, and then signed treaties that allowed them the freedom to maintain their own laws and institutions (and serve as advisors to the Raj).

&gt; The Specials (also known as The Special AKA) is an English ""2 Tone"" ska revival band  formed in 1977 in Coventry, England. Their music combines a danceable ska beat with punk's energy, underpinned by an informed political and social stance. 

&gt; The group was formed by songwriter/keyboardist Jerry Dammers, with Terry Hall (vocals), Lynval Golding (guitar, vocals) and a rhythm section featuring Horace Panter (bass) and John Bradbury (drums; born 16 February 1953, died 28 December 2015). The band wore mod-style 1960s period ""rude boy"" outfits (pork pie hats, mohair suits, and loafers). In 1980, their song ""Too Much Too Young"", the lead track on their The Special AKA Live! EP, reached number one in the UK. In 1981, the unemployment-themed single ""Ghost Town"" also hit number one in the UK Singles Chart. After seven consecutive UK Top 10 singles between 1979 and 1981, the band broke up in 1984. A version of the band reformed from 1994-2001. In 2008, the band reformed again and, in2009, embarked on a 30th anniversary tour. In 2010, they toured America and Europe. In 2011 they again touring the UK.

&gt; In 1979, their debut LP hit the shelves and quickly soared into the UK Top Five. The album was produced by Elvis Costello and was released under founding member, Jerry Dammer's record label 2 Tone Records.

&gt; Following the success of their debut album, Specials, their second and final album, More Specials was released. This expanded the group's 2 tone sound to include lounge music and other influences. 

&gt; After two albums and a string of very successful singles the band called it quits in 1984. The bands members moved onto their other musical projects. In 1994 they toured with the original line-up without Terry Hall and Jerry Dammers. Roddy sang Terry's parts. The line-up changed in 1996. The band split again in 2001.

&gt; In 2008, The Specials officially announced that they would reform and embark on a 30th Anniversary Tour in 2009. The founding member, Jerry Dammers was not part of the reformed Specials and relationships between him and the rest of the band have remained sore, particularly on Dammers' side of things.

&gt; In January 2013, the Specials announced the departure of Neville Staple. In February 2014 it was revealed that another original member, Roddy Radiation, had left the reformed group. In spite of this, the Specials played an extensive tour in the autumn of 2014 with Steve Cradock as lead guitarist.

nazrinhedgen,Wintersday,,"&gt;**I want to join a server with a large population of players mainly for raiding and a good economy.**

Servers only matter for World vs World. The game servers run off of Megaservers where in PvE everyone can play with each other (all NA players can play with fellow NA players and EU players the same with EU)

The trading post is linked so no problem there either.

&gt;**Beside HoT what are any real cash shop Items I should invest in that will give me a substantial QoL boost or something that I should buy right away so I don't worry about getting later?**

If you plan on playing a LOT coming back, copper-fed salvage-o-matic or the silver one, and maybe some permanent tools. Maybe material storage expansions or bank slots.

&gt;**I have watched so many reviews on the current game and there is just so much to do compared to the start of HoT or really the game before the expansion is there any guide I could follow to getting geared that isnt from years ago or the absolute start of HoT unless it's the same?**

Gear is pretty much either Berserker for power or Viper/Trailblazers for Condi.

There are some other gear sets for other specific roles/things that you can see on metabattle.com though.

&gt;**Is leveling fast in this game still professions or how could I get my other desired classes fast into the endgame without having to straight up buy a instant 80 token?**

You can only get 1 instant 80 token and that is with the initial purchase of HoT. Other than that tomes of knowledge from PvP or WvW are good for leveling. Leveling the normal way (events and such) still give quite a lot of exp but it can be kinda boring.

&gt;**Are there tiers in raiding? Do I need to do a certain amount of fractals or things around that nature to dive into raiding or how does that process work I haven't really found a good guide on how to start gearing and progressing to the raiding section of the game**

With raiding it is mostly just learn the mechanics of the fights. For gear you find a build for raiding on whatever class you want and that determines your role in the raid, use http://metabattle.com for it or http://qtfy.eu/builds/ to find a raid build. Otherwise just learn skill rotations and watch videos to learn mechanics. There are some subreddits for raiding as well but I don't remember exactly what they're called since I don't go to them.

&gt;**Has the process of getting a legendary been changed at all or made easier/harder since the start of the game?**

With the launch of HoT you can ""make"" precursors now using HoT masteries and going through a collection process. There is I think 3 collections for non HoT legendaries and 4 for HoT legendaries. You have to finish collection 1 of a legendary before moving onto the next collection too (which means crafting the item you get a recipe for after completing the collection)

Otherwise the process of making a legendary is the same besides the fact you can craft precursors now instead of RNG/buying them. 

Still takes a bit of time/money to ""craft"" the precursors through the collection ways though.

Some of the new HoT legendary precursors though you just flat out craft them instead of going through the collection process, they changed it to crafting for the newer HoT ones cause otherwise it would take them too long to release new legendaries. The crafting way has made it so they can release a new legendary weapon every living world season 3 episode.

You're saying that if non-nationals could vote, anyone could come live in the UK for 2 months to purposefully fuck up the country's politics. That's idiotic for several reasons: 

1- Those voters would not create a new party, the choices at the elections are still the ones that _you_ (as a country) put on the table, so any outcome would be your responsibility, for creating those choices. Democracy doesn't stop being democracy just because the results show a trend that you personally don't agree with. If you're referring in particular to the EU referendum, yes it's legitimate to believe that if EU citizens had voted, the results would have been different. But that's not the same as refusing them a vote in general elections.

2- People who live here permanently actually have a stake in the elections outcome, so they would vote for what they believe are their best interests, which are the same as yours, as residents of a country that has control over your daily survival, your pension, your children's access to education, etc.

3- Nobody is suggesting giving a general election vote to people who have been here for less time than they would need to qualify for permanent residency or citizenship. Pretending otherwise is being wilfully obtuse, to use your own words.

4- Arguing that leaving the UK means you've abandoned your responsibilities to your country and should be denied a say in its future is saying that you should be stripped of your British citizenship when you move abroad.

&gt;Sounds like a pretty blatant political stunt that was planned from the offset. Did it really matter what May said or did during the meal? The side that leaks it gets to put whatever spin on the conversation that it wants.

CruciA019,,,"well then
heres what you should know before you enter
PUG (Pick Up Games):

In order to join a PUG, you need to join the voice channel where we gather usually the “PUG Lobby” or ""Amateur PUG Lobby"" channel. Normally, someone starts a PUG by typing @everyone in the Discord group.
We always play 5v5 stopwatch with Friendly Fire ON, in a DBN private server which means everyone will get XP, Cases, and Credits normally.
In order to participate in a PUG, you need to be willing to use Discord and have a microphone. You don't need to be experienced player, but being able to play at least couple different roles is recommended. (more about this later on)

eam Selection:

After we have gathered 10 people (or more for multiple PUGs) on Discord, we decide which server region we will use, either EU or US East. This depends on how many US/EU players there are in each specific PUG.
When we have everyone in the server, we decide how we are going to mix the teams. Usually we have 2 volunteer captains (normally veteran PUG players) picking their teams, in the 1-2-2-2-1 order. This means that the captain with first pick will pick 1 person, the second captain will pick 2 people, the first captain will pick another 2 people, the second captain will pick another 2 people, and finally the first captain will take the final player. We do this in an attempt to balance each PUG as much as possible. It is possible that an admin will trade a couple of players after team picks have been completed. This will only be done if an admin sees that a PUG is extremely unbalanced on one side.

Map Selection:

Once team picks have been completed, the map will be selected. The players in the PUG will decide together what map will be played.
After this, an admin separates the teams in their own voice channels and the teams decide what role each player will play.
When both teams are ready, the game can begin. Remember to communicate with your team and work together.
PUGs are not serious business, but people who play them usually search for a more competitive experience than they would find in a public game, or even in ranked game.
The only rule we have is the ""one merc rule"", which means a team can't have multiple of the same merc played at the same time. For example, if a team has spawned in 2 Skyhammers. This happens sometimes and it's not end of the world, but one of them needs to ""tap out"" or ""kill out"" when it's noticed. You’re allowed to have multiple of a specific merc in your squads, but you’re not allowed to have more than one on the battlefield at any time.

Roles:

Keep in mind that this is the ""meta"" and it's not forbidden to play something outside of it.
In general, a team should have a frontliner, something like Fragger or Thunder.
Second is an engineer. Mainly for repairing/planting the objective when attacking, and disarming enemy plants when defending. The engineer can have an air support with him on EV escorting maps (Chapel, Bridge), to help taking care of the EV.
Then there is the role called ""DPS"" or ""second assault"" or ""Flex"". This role usually plays whatever they see fit for the situation. They can have assault classes, snipers, air support, basically anything.
Also a team will often have two medics. In general, a team wants to have an Aura on defense for the healing station. Other than that it's not so strict what the medics play.

Amateur PUG: This is the place where you should start if you're new to pick up games or new to Dirty Bomb. There will usually be an admin here to guide you. The process starts with someone announcing that they are starting or looking for players for an amateur PUG in Discord. You just have to join the specified voice channel so everyone will know you're playing. Sometimes there might be few veteran players playing as well, but they are mostly there if there are not enough amateurs (these veterans will be split between the two teams in order to make the game as even as possible). There are no requirements for amateur PUGs, even though microphone is highly recommended. PUGs are all about working with your team. There are usually no merc bans, but this is up to the PUG Admin’s decision.

Veteran PUG: This is the next step from Amateur PUGs. Once you’ve established yourself in Amateur PUGs, the Admins will guide you here if they see that you are able to hold your own. These PUGs are filled with nerds who play daily, and are often mostly composed of level 100+ players. Here you are required to have a microphone and be willing to talk in order to play. There are no hard level requirements, but if you're below level 20 in Dirty Bomb, you might consider staying in Amateur PUGs. Often, there will be a few merc bans in effect (i.e. Thunder, Rhino, Recons, etc). These PUGs follow the same ruleset as other PUG matches, however they are designed for more experienced players.

ROFL

&gt; Jewish and Arab merchants in renaissance Europe never culturally assimilated, and they made mad cash selling spices and shit to bourgeois white people.

Welp, we see your grasp on history is totally amazeballs. 

&gt;Black people brought to the United States were assimilated pretty effectively

And now I understand that you don't know what the fuck the word assimilation even means. Being completely stripped of ones culture is not assimilation. 

&gt; In my home city most of the influential and successful blacks were ones who's parents and grandparents were involved in black power struggles in the 60s and 70s so if anything blacks who resisted assimilation turned out better for it.

TIL living in a ghetto where selling drugs or being an entertainer are the only real outs is 'better off'. Oh, and of course that is entirely the fault of white people, because of course it is. 

&gt;When a minority ""assimilates"" to the dominant culture they're trying to beat it at it's own game

Oh I see, all of those refugees only want to come to America because they think they are better than Americans! Not because they are fleeing from whatever shithole they currently reside in. Obviously the reason wherever they came from went to hell was Empire, not because they created a failed state.

deck_hand,,,"&gt;Not since World War II have more human beings been at risk from disease and starvation than at this very moment. 

Not since World War II have more human beings been at risk for falling while walking than at this very moment.  In fact, not since World War II have more humans been at risk of accidentally eating something wonderful and exotic than at this very moment.  Why? well there are a lot more people at this very moment than there ever have been, in the history of the planet.  The population continues to grow, and it's growing very rapidly.  The first statement in this article, while true, is actually meaningless.

&gt;On March 10th, Stephen O’Brien, under secretary-general of the United Nations for humanitarian affairs, informed the Security Council that 20 million people in three African countries -- Nigeria, Somalia, and South Sudan -- as well as in Yemen were likely to die if not provided with emergency food and medical aid. 

He could have very well said that those same 20 million people are likely to die even if provided with emergency food and medical aid. I was a a conference this last weekend and someone made the statement that in the 1700s, the mortality rate was very high.  I commented to my wife that the mortality rate was 100%, since everyone that was alive in the 1700s is now dead.  He mean ""infant mortality"" but he never once said the word ""infant"" and talked on this subject for half an hour.  

We are all going to die.  It's a fact of life that's been true since life began on this earth.  It's very possible that climate change, in general, contributes to lowering the average age at which we die, but.... most deaths come as a result of disease of one kind or another, and we are MUCH better at combatting disease than we were a mere generation ago.  If we look at our ability to combat disease now, as compared with, oh, pre-World War II, the fact of the matter is that ""not since World War II has so many people had access to good medical care, and thus had better chances of surviving disease.""  Or, since before WW II for that matter.

&gt;“We are at a critical point in history,” he declared. 

Which point of history has not been critical for a large number of people?  

&gt;“Already at the beginning of the year we are facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the U.N.” 

Largest, because a huge number of people might be affected?  Interesting.  Oh, wait, yes, this is based on the claim that billions will be devastated by the rise in temperature, the collapse of the food system, etc.  Good. Carry on.

&gt; Without coordinated international action, he added, “people will simply starve to death [or] suffer and die from disease.”

Like they have in poor nations since, well, the invention of nations.  People starved to death and died from disease when I was a child, while we had been seeing no increase in global temperature for decades.   And we saw the same thing back in the early 1900s, when we were cooling to the lowest point of the last 150 years.  If warmth causes death and disease, and cold causes death and disease, and presumably stable temperature causes death and disease, maybe its not the temperature that's really causing death and disease.

&gt; Yemen, 5.1 million in the Lake Chad area of northeastern Nigeria, 5 million in South Sudan, and 2.9 million in Somalia. 

Never in history have so many people in so many areas... wait.. I think America in the Dust Bowl era counts.  How about Europe in the Dark Ages?  What about pre-colonial North America, when famine and disease killed off something like 90% of the population that was formerly something like 100 million people.  This guy needs to get his facts straight.

&gt;In each of these countries, some lethal combination of war, persistent drought, and political instability is causing drastic cuts in essential food and water supplies. 

If we remove drought from that list, we'd still end up with death and disease.  Anyone remember the extreme humanity crisis that was Ethiopia in the 1980s?  That was mild drought (yes, it was happening even then) combined with a political movement that was using famine as a way to eliminate political rivals.  People are the plague, so many of us are horrible, genocidal criminals that it's hard to have any sympathy for them when they then have troubles later.

&gt;All in all, the cost of such an intervention is not great: an estimated $4.4 billion to implement that U.N. action plan and save most of those 20 million lives. 

Yep, we could save them.  It's in our power to do so. We could step in and temporarily give them food, water, medicine, and presumably guns and bombs and chemical weapons so that they could continue to have more dirt poor kids, continue to kill each other in new and inventive ways.  Are they dying because there aren't enough of them, or because their are too many of them, using too few resources in the region, and because they are not rich enough to maintain an infrastructure that can survive natural (or even unnatural) swings in the precipitation cycle?

Maybe the desert regions of North Africa isn't the best place for a large population of poor people to live?

&gt;Here’s the question I think we all should be asking: Is this what a world battered by climate change will be like -- one in which tens of millions, even hundreds of millions of people perish from disease, starvation, and heat prostration while the rest of us, living in less exposed areas, essentially do nothing to prevent their annihilation?

Yes.  Since that's the way the world has reacted to environmental crisis in the last 300 years, I predict that's the way we will react in the next 100 as well.  We don't change much.  ",True,0,1493637446,,False,0,dgzbl1l,t3_68j24c,t3_68j24c,1496162739,1,False,climatechange,t5_2rawx,

I guess for some reason I expected them to have a navy on par with like, France or at least Australia (my country).

But I suppose it makes sense. Most Canadians live inland from the ocean (not counting the great lakes - good luck getting an invading navy in there). Their closest/only neighbours are their friends and allies, who also have the largest and most powerful navy in history which protects Canada on both sides. And to the north they are protected by ice for much of the year, and even when there's no sea ice there's still thousands of miles of impassable tundra, taiga and bogs. To the east is western Europe who are also Canada's friends and allies. To the west is thousands of miles of Pacific Ocean.

On the other hand Australia is an island surrounded by other islands (often unstable regimes or countries that don't have a lot in common with Australia), nearby to Asia, and is vulnerable to invasion from the north and west. Almost all Aussies live in coastal cities, so they're doubly vulnerable. Australia also has to exert control over lots of nearby island territories and has to defend countries like PNG, Nauru, East Timor and New Zealand. Our only ally in the region is NZ who are tiny, super isolated and have only a small military.

Accreditation is per course here, not per university. The fact that government subsidizes only accredited courses, that does indeed eliminate non-accredited universities; as they just can't compete.

Dutch language has two words for doctor: ""Dokter"" and ""Arts"". The latter is a protected title, the former isn't.

The ""Dokter"" term is now frequently used for non-medical diagnostic services: ""computer dokter"" or ""tuin dokter"" (garden doctor), the same way factory is now used for various non-industrial services in hipster-circles.

Healthcare safety enforcement doesn't rely on titles here, though. You need to be a licensed MD to practice invasive medicine (anything involving scalpel or medication). That license is only awarded if the doctor keeps their certifications up-to-date, and can be lost through unethical behavior.

WilliamofYellow,,,"&gt;Evolutionary selection pressures were different in the hot savanna where Africans lived than in the cold northern regions Europeans experienced, or the even colder Arctic regions of East Asians. These ecological differences affected not only morphology but also behavior. It has been proposed that the farther north the populations migrated out of Africa, the more they encountered the cognitively demanding problems of gathering and storing food, gaining shelter, making clothes, and raising children successfully during prolonged winters (Rushton, 2000). As these populations evolved into present-day Europeans and East Asians, the ecological pressures selected for larger brains, slower rates of maturation, and lower levels of testosterone—with concomitant reductions in sexual potency, aggressiveness, and impulsivity; increases in family stability, advanced planning, self-control, rule following, and longevity; and the other characteristics listed in Table 3.

I met so many Eastern European builders and plummers that did this. 

Yes agree bank care about thier bottom line and this is why I do not think they are going any time soon. London is still a good fit for banks despite the likely lose of passporting.  Regarding house prices they will not charge across the whole UK and I think they will only drop in London.  10% is not an issue as no negative equity for most 20 would only be an issue if they stayed down to long. Most would just avoid selling. Would certainly be risk tough. Not much that can be done to prop up house prices. I guess intrest rates can go lower but hopefully will not need to happen. 

I think you may be misunderstanding me about ""the left"". I agree with you and do not want to eliminate the social care within the country. I want it to increase it. This country needs a strong left like it needs to a strong right. Balance in politics is important. I used to like PR as an idea but although fptp is unfair in some ways it does lead to strong governments and from my perspective keep extremes at bay and this is not a bad thing. Also allow government to get things done. Bigger changes due to extreme getting lots of influence can be very risky.  As an example the tories have made some adjustments to ukip vote but under pr could have had a tory ukip coalition, this IMHO would be bad. I do not want all things that will happen because of brexit but I do want some of them and accept the other thing may be needed in short term to keep economy strong. I think the area that worries me most is the environment, safety and employee rights as am worried the tories could go ""to far"" in removing regulations in these areas, although I think some less regulation would not be too bad if it brought in more tax and grew the economy. What I want is a strong opposition so if it gets out of hand in 5 years they would have a good chance to stop it. Would also be less likely to go to far in first place. Too much split and idealism within the left parties does not work under fptp.    Also any compromise in the area above should be used for NHS, looking after unemployed or people that are employed but do not make enough to live. Better care for the disabled and elderly.  I do not expect most of this from the tories but have everything crossed we will have a stronger opposition in 5 years. So they can hopefully used increased tax to offer this. However also accept brexit could go very badly and none of this will happen but hope was the last thing in Pandoras box.

Perhaps I didn't explain my reasoning well.

The poor voter turn-out for EU elections, in fact the **decreasing** turnout in most countries is a reflection of how poorly the EU has engaged the electorate.

People don't think it matters, they don't feel connected to the process. This seems little different to me from young voters not voting because politicians fail to connect with them as mentioned in the Mirror article. Perhaps I could have specified/differentiated between EU politicians and the EU in general terms. 

I did also want to include the idea of the EU as an institution, which should essentially have been running a PR campaign to promote its goals, history, activities, and achievements something not perhaps within the remit of individual MEPs who would promote their own EU agendas to get elected. 

Thus pro-active politicians aren't the only solution to the EU's malaise although clearly a crucial one.

The second link, I'd seen before.

A part of me feels that Brexiters jumped on the sovereignty angle to legitimise what were really anti-immigration concerns.

That aside, both the sovereignty and immigration arguments have been shown to be false, as far as I know.

The UK needs immigrants. 

The UK Parliament was always sovereign. Some people just didn't want to accept that power-sharing is inherent in being a member of **any** group, whilst conveniently forgetting the power that is derived from acting as a unified bloc, a lesson we're about to learn in devastating fashion once the Brexit negotiations begin in earnest.

We welcome the continued support of the UK military forces, their financial might and their help in scientific, educational and humanitarian causes and to this end will seek to continue as many joint programs as possible. Farewell our friend, good luck to the UK and hoping this is merely an temporary adieu.

UK - it is with sadness that we leave a shining beacon of peace and cooperation. For now we will have to support the European project from the sidelines. We shall work as hard to support you from outside as we did from within. To this end we do not seek to threaten with ideas of tax havens or removed military support. There are many European projects that we would like to contribute to and keep access to, especially those concerning education, the rights of our youth, science, finance and military co-operation. In recognition of our closeness and common interests all current shared EU laws will be enshrined in UK law and all major , future, EU legislation considered for inclusion as appropriate. We will work hard to make a fair and just UK that may one day be able to re-apply to the EU if the conditions are right.

&gt; I am saying there is a correlation between the increase in Muslim refugee/immigrants in France and deaths of French people.

Germany took in almost ten times as many muslim immigrants in the migration crisis preceeding the latest wave of terror attacks, yet the amount of deaths in Germany clearly isn't corelated. Also - as I said before - most attackers involved weren't immigrants but born in Europe.

&gt; Address that problem, even if you don't want Le Pen to address the problem

Very much agreeing here. I do think there's a problem, but I sure as hell don't want politicians like Trump, Le Pen, etc. dealing with it. I don't think isolationism is the answer to the problem as it brings with it a whole myriad of other (economical, social and political) problems.

&gt; If there is crime, you say, ""Ah, we have crime here and we need to step up law enforcement in the area to fix it."" Calling out the problem of crime is not fear.

It is not. However, introducing unreasonable policies and justifying it by saying ""You don't want even more crime to happen, do you?"" actually is.

&gt; But if the people want out, why not do what the people want?

I understand your concern. But i think people know what they are voting for come sunday. In a way the election IS a referendum on the EU, as Macron is an outspoken supporter of it, while Le Pen is an outspoken critic. Mélenchon was a critic, too (a left-wing critic though) and I think we're going to see some of his voters going to Le Pen because of her EU criticism.

Anyway, we've pretty much completely moved from the original discussion and I'm not sure what the merrits are, of having a discussion that only the two of us are following anymore, I'd like to come to a conclusion.

I get that you care about problems of muslim immigration to Europe, and so do I. We may not agree on the solution of it, but we agree that there is a problem that needs to be solved.

Since you care about the issue I urge you to watch [this documentation done for french/german public TV.
](http://www.arte.tv/de/videos/068423-001-A/europas-muslime-1-2) (you can enable english subtitles in the settings on the botton right corner) 

It is really good and takes an unbiased look at the Situation of Europe's Muslims, talking to muslims from very different backgrounds in Germany, Belgium, France and Spain (some more liberal/western, some very conservative)

One of the two journalists doing this documentation is Hamed Abdel Samed, an Egyptian-German Ex-Muslim, who turned atheist after a conservative muslim upbringing, and is since very critical of Islam. To the point that there's been a public call for his death in Egypt, and he has to live under personal protection whenever in public.

My point being, he's not someone you'd expect from shying away from critisizing Islam, which makes this documentation so interesting.

TheGreasyPole,redpill,Red Pill Husband,"&gt;As I said in my post, I agree with you that in practice the number of women and men whose careers take the bullet in order to have kids are never going to be the same. But they could be much more equal.

They could be. But what if women actually *don't want them to be more equal*.

What if women *actually prefer* to look after the kids.

What if they have an inbuilt genetic predisposition that makes them more likely to prefer that choice, than to be the breadwinner.

THATS the problem. We've got pretty good scientific reasons to believe thats actually the case... the women feel better/enjoy life more/have higher QoL (on average) being the homemaker than men do.

If thats the case... Then feminists trying to bend the law/society to get more women into work are actually *making more women unhappy, unnecessarily*... And whaddya know ? Since the feminist revolution thats exactly what women report. LOWER happiness levels.

&gt;Interestingly, studies were done into why men in the uk don't tend to take advantage of the shared parental leave, and whilst women wanting the leave was a factor, the workplace making it difficult for them, lack of awareness they could take leave, and fear it would disproportionately affect their earnings were also huge factors. 

And why wern't men making themselves aware ? And why wern't *women* fearing the wage loss ? 

You're missing the causal factor here.... Men are pre-wired to have a greater interest in higher wages than women are, genetically, because in the evolutionary past guys ""wired that way"" had an advantage over males who wern't. Just as women ""wired"" to want to look after kids more than males did had an advantage over females not wired that way.

Thats the point.

Forcing the humans to go against that wiring (rather than allowing them the *choice* to) is going to make them unhappy.

&gt;Internationally, when leave wasn't being split between parents, studies in other European countries showed more men taking paternity leave, even equal leave to women. Now, I'm only a equalitarian rather than a feminist, but surely that sounds fairer to everyone? Reduces the 'pay gap' and offers fairer circumstances to men too, who otherwise, as you say, let the mother's stronger nesting instinct take all the shared leave.

Well, yeah... If it's just ""free money"" I'm not surprised both men and women took as much ""full pay leave"" as they were allowed to. Shit, forget about paternity/maternity leave... If my company offered me 8 weeks paid leave per year instead of 5 weeks, I'd take 8 weeks too. It's ""free money"".

I've got nothing against that either.

But the interesting thing about the UK law was how it forced the couple to make a trade off... and how when they did so people revealed their innate preferences ... men surrendering the family time for higher wages.... and women surrendering the higher wages for more family time.

If those preferences are persistent (and they seem to be) it would explain a whole lot of the gender pay gap. A very great chunk of the difference between the 25% and 2% figure in OP.

&gt;To be honest, I do agree that using the 100:75 pay gap is pretty misleading and not that useful unless specifically talking about child care issues, and whilst I know there still are issues regarding actual equal pay for the same job despite equality laws (have actually experienced and reported this myself!) this use of the pay gap statistics aren't very helpful for that. However, I get why feminists use it.

So do I.... For the same reason Republicans use the ""after 100 days unemployment under Obama was 9%"" statistic to defend Trump.

* 6-core Ryzen chip which is very capable in games and will also handle CPU intensive tasks well.
* Unlocked chipset motherboard allowing you to overclock if you choose. The stock CPU cooler should cope well with this as well. 
* 16GB of RAM because there's enough room in the budget and it's becoming more standard. If you need to save some money, reduce this to 8GB which will still be plenty for games.
* An SSD for your boot drive, it's large enough to also store some games on there as well.
* 1TB hard drive for larger files
* RX 580 8GB - very capable 1080p card, combined with the freesync monitor it should be able to maz out everything you throw at it
* The case is the one I have, it's a great micro-ATX case with a side panel window. The motherboard is micro-ATX so everything fits fine in a nice tidy package.
* Supernova G3 550W - fully modular power supply with enough headroom for overclocking. It's also gold efficiency rated so it should be nice and quiet.
* The monitor is a high refresh rate 144Hz panel with AMD freesync. The freesync gives you buttery smooth gameplay and 144Hz is incredible if you haven't yet seen it in person. You should be getting sufficient FPS in most games with the PC configuration.
* Keyboard and mouse is just a cheap, no frills combo from coolermaster. However, if you have wiggle room in your budget I highly recommend spending the extra for a nice mechanical keyboard. r/mechanicalkeyboards is great for some recommendations.

Because to each country according to it's needs, and from each country according to it's abilities. Poland did not have to take in much refugees at all.

quantumcipher,,,"&gt; Let me start off by saying, I am 100% sure what this is about, and it has nothing to do with what you're saying. I'm not speculating, I know who made those symbols and why.

A mostly accurate statement, with the exception of the last sentence, which is in itself a form of speculation.

&gt; Scottish Rite is a body you can enter after the 3rd degree, Master Mason, which is what the Blue Lodge is for. 

You're partially correct, as there are only three degrees universally acknowledged in Freemasonry, up to the third degree of Master Mason. All other degrees are either conferred by a specific rite or dependent body, some of which recognizing one another's degrees, while others do not. Most are familiar with the 33 degrees of the Scottish Rite, the 33rd being an honorary degree and highest acknowledged by conventional Masonry, the 32nd being the last 'workable' degree within that rite. What most are not aware of if the number of irregular rites with additional degrees, the most notable being the Egyptian Rite or Rite of Memphis-Misraim, having 99 degrees, a highly esoteric/occult-oriented rite compared to conventional Masonry, and one that was heavily influential in the formation of the O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis) and AMORC (a form of American pseudo-Rosicrucianism).

&gt;I'm not aware of Washington going above the 3rd degree, and I don't even think the modern Scottish Rite existed then.

The Scottish Rite had its roots in the mid 18th century, and was largely restructured into what it is today by Albert Pike in the mid 19th century.

&gt; The Eye of Providence was absolutely, 100% not a masonic symbol. It was a Christian symbol, representing Jesus, the stone the builder rejected being the cap stone.

The 'eye of providence' was foremost a hermetic and Rosicrucian symbol, used by middle age pseudo-Catholics in the artwork of their cathedrals as a form of veiled symbolism, as was necessary at the time, later adopted by Freemasons to represent the G.A.O.T.U. (Great Architect of the Universe, e.g. the God or 'creator' of your choosing).

&gt; If you want to really go down the rabbit hole, look at Franklin. He ran one of the most important lodges in the world in Paris, and he had been in European secret societies like the Hellfire Club for decades. But then later in his life, you can read that this was all a ruse.

I don't recall him being the lodges Worshipful or Grand Master, though he was active in the [Les Neuf Sœurs \(Nine Sisters\) lodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Neuf_S%C5%93urs) of the Grand Orient of France, from which he obtained support from the French during the American revolution, the Grand Lodge of which also playing a role in [supporting the French revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Orient_de_France#French_Revolution) curiously. As for the Hellfire Club, it was known he had at minimum attended one of its gatherings. Anything beyond that is speculative, though it is entirely plausible he could have been actively involved in that group as well.

&gt; You are mistaking symbols of the Illuminati, a group diametrically opposed to the masons and going back to before Plato, for those of the masons. 

I'm not sure where you would have heard this, or how you came to this conclusion. As far as I'm aware there has been no Illuminati group that ever opposed Freemasonry. The Bavarian Illuminati worked hand in glove with Masonry in its time, and actively sought to 'infiltrate' Masonic lodges to tap initiates, which it did successfully until it was disbanded. The Illuminati orders that preceded the Bavarian Order (the Alumbrados / Illuminati of Spain, Illuminés of France, Illuminati of Avignon / Swedenborg, etc.) were not known to be anti-Masonic either, some also having ties to Masonry if not other related orders, nor was the Illuminati Order of the 19th century (of Theodor Reuss and Engel) and beyond anti-Masonic, rather ultra or pan-Masonic, meaning they were a separate order distinct from and not directly related to Masonry in any capacity. Other orders that exist today that openly practice Illuminism, such as the A∴A∴ / Order of the Silver Star, and those with literal 'Illuminati' degrees and grades, such as the O.T.O. / Ordo Templi Orientis and AMORC / Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, aren't anti-Masonic either, being entirely separate orders though not necessarily incompatible with Freemasonry either.

&gt; The symbol you are calling Moloch (based on Alex Jones' intentional misrepresentation) is Minerva, the Goddess of Wisdom.

This is correct. The Bavarian Order and the O.T.O. have had 'Minerval' degrees within them, as an homage to the Goddess of wisdom Minerva. The infamous Owl shrine at the Bohemian Grove was modeled, in part, after Minerva, as a replica of an ancient statue of Minerva in the form of an owl found in the club's headquarters makes evident.

&gt; After the real revolution, the masons and other occultists come along and try to pretend they were behind the revolution.

This is entirely speculative, and largely a matter of opinion. It's more likely the related orders, created by those who also created the orders that exist today, lent a hand in the revolutions you speak of, to further their centuries-long agenda of removing power from the Papal theocracy and monarchies in Europe and the Americas at the time, to appear as a noble cause of liberation exoterically however esoterically exploiting the masses to create a climate with which they would be free to arise to power, though that would be entirely speculative as well.

&gt; Pike puts Illuminati into the higher Scottish Rite degrees

There is a great deal of esoteric symbolism and philosophy in the higher degrees of Scottish Rite. If you find the time, I recommend you read Pike's magnum opus, Morals &amp; Dogma, an exposition elaborating on a good portion of this symbolism.

&gt;  and Satanists like Crowley pretend they are the Illuminati, too.

A few things: Crowley was not a Satanist technically, though he was certainly anti-Christian, and ever the egoist had embraced the title of 'Great Beast' (Mega Therion) and number 666 no less. That said, what he actually practiced and preached was not even remotely a form of Satanism. He was a Thelemite, foremost, a syncretic amalgamation of various currents of Western and Eastern esotericism which preceded it, including but not limited to the following:
The Kemetic / Egyptian Mysteries, Hermeticism, Greek Mysteries, Gnosticism, Templarism, Rosicrucianism, Hermetic Qabalah, Neoplatonism, Alchemy, Theurgy, Enochian magic, Goetia, Buddhist Yoga, Hindu Tantra, among others. A majority of what Crowley incorporated into Thelema was technically plagiarized from the adepts and mystery schools that came before him, with the exception of some of the key aspects of Thelema, found in the Book of Law, a form of 'channeled' material in a sense (supposedly). The orders Crowley had been most active with either openly practiced Illuminism (the A∴A∴) or incorporated literal 'Illuminati' degrees into its curriculum (the O.T.O.), so whether he did so simply to overstate their own prestige or used the term as a form of technicality is a matter of opinion.

&gt; Crowley has things like anal rape and eating shit as a ""Eucharist"" as part of his ""Illuminati.""

Sex magick, tantric and alchemical, is a core though for the most part optional component of Thelema, outlined and required in the higher degrees of the O.T.O. which does involve ritual sodomy as part of the degree work, though I wouldn't consider it rape if done consequentially. Coprophagy was something Crowley was alleged to, and hinted at practicing, though it is not required nor recommended in the O.T.O. let alone Thelema in general. On the other hand, consuming semen and menstrual fluid in the form of a cake for example is actually recommended as a form of 'eucharist' of sorts, so you aren't entirely off base with that remark.

&gt; Now freemasons either pretend they did the American Revolution. 

This is debatable and will vary from Mason to Mason. The forces behind the American Revolution, both visible and hidden, at least in part, were undeniably Masonic (Washington, various other founding fathers, Franklin, Lafayette, etc). Was this part of a broader Masonic agenda, and in turn of agenda of those created Masonry to begin with? That is also debatable. 

&gt; Or they pretend the Illuminati are the bad guys, when it's actually them that are causing all the trouble.

- Repito solo hay una excepción en la historia económica mundial y por circunstancias especiales.
- Nunca ha colapsado una economía por subir demasiado los salarios, si por lo contrario: bajarlos, y en el caso Marroquí, al disponer de moneda propia cualquier exceso, de darse el caso, se amortiguaría con la tasa de cambio, y como es mucho mas importante para el bienestar de la población (la economía es la ciencia que se encarga de estudiar como satisfacer las necesidades HUMANAS) el consumo interno, en casi todas las economías, que su subida salarial no les haga mas baratos los productos y servicios importados en proporción a su sueldo, no es mala cosa sino todo lo contrario porque incentiva la sustitución de importaciones.

- El problema del debate político económico son las falsas equivalencias 

- ¿Soluciona el desempleo subir salarios y bajar jornadas repartiendo el trabajo?: Si, 

-¿Crea otros problemillas económicos menores aplicar una medida (cualquiera) de reajuste económico, y no iba a ser menos esta?: Si 

- ¿Como vive mejor la gran mayoría de la gente, con paro o sin paro en su economía? ¿Hay menos suicidios? ¿Hay mas felicidad? :Si

- ¿Aumenta la felicidad al subirse los sueldos, aunque se diese el caso de una devaluación de la moneda? : Si
 
- ¿Disminuye la felicidad al bajarse los sueldos, aunque se revalorice la moneda?: Si

- Pues todo lo demás son zarandajas (dicho en el sentido de cosas poco importantes, o ""flecos"") que poco importan a la población en general, y a la mayoría de negocios y poco le influyen, y que los técnicos del ministerio (y/o del IBEX35)  lidiarán con ellos como buenamente puedan, y por mal que lo hagan, gentes con trabajo, sin paro (capacidad de ir cambiando de trabajo, que es muy importante), y con salarios mas altos y jornadas mas cortas serán mas felices, y además el PIB subirá.

- ¿A que la morosidad baja con subidas salariales?

- ¿A que los costes financieros de las empresas y particulares bajan en proporción? , por cierto mecanismo, el de la inflación, que ayudaba mucho a pagar las hipotecas, y que no se está dando en los últimos 10 años causando buena parte del problema, así que bendita inflación si se da, y se reparte bien (mayor inflación salarial que de precios) a lo que ayudará poder comprar por internet en la UE muchos artículos si los empresarios españoles quieren pasarse de listos con los precios (mecanismo anti inflacionario con el que la propuesta también cuenta)

- En resumen, que tal numerito (indicador económico)  puede empeorar: Si ¿Es peor, para los ciudadanos, (la economía y el PIB) que el paro que hay? : No

theredcebuano,hero,Long Live the Eternal Science of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism!,"You mean socialist society. Socialism includes a state ruled by the workers, which has a planned economy and has the goal of transitioning to communism. 

Now, to what you said that most socialist societies have failed due to that, it's actually a misunderstanding of their situation back then. In fact, when Burkina Faso became socialist under Thomas Sankara, their food production tripled due to correct policies which included land reform. 

You have to take in both the external factors and the internal factors. External including weather, arable land, etc. Internal including policy and productive forces. 

When it came to Stalin's Soviet Union, they experienced a famine due to the fact that Stalin focused a little bit too much on industry while forcing collectivization on the peasants. What he wanted to do wasn't wrong - he wanted to modernize agriculture but the way he did it and when he did it was bad. These peasants hoped that in the revolution they'd get their own plot of land, which they received during land reform. However, Stalin wanted to increase their production to stir industry into action and so he collectivized the land which went against what the peasants wanted. What he should've done was take it slowly. Although I think he was forced into doing so because the threat of invasion from the capitalist countries was high. Couple this with the fact that weather in Northern Europe tends to be pretty cold and you get the famines in the early S.U. Interestingly though, they achieved food sufficiency after two five year plans. 

Mao committed a similar mistake during the Great Leap Forward but to a much larger extent. He really focused on industry when he should've focused on developing agriculture patiently with the masses. Add this to the fact that some regions were already experiencing famine, and you get China's last ever famine - the GLF Famine. After that, they never had any more famines. 

This teaches us a lot of things, mainly in the importance of agriculture and its relation with industry. Those things above aren't inherent within the socialist system. They come from a specific historical background and we ought to learn many things from them. 

However, the socialist system with its planned allocation of resources easily achieved food-sufficiency in many countries. Some had to learn it the hard way like Cuba and North Korea when the S.U. collapsed (I mean, I wouldn't call Cuba and North Korea socialist but they have planned economies so that counts) and some were able to slip through it like Burkina Faso. People got what they needed, production in food was raised when it was needed, lowered when it was needed. And constant modernization of agriculture helped this. 

But not so in the capitalist system which, through its highest stage imperialism, constantly forces other countries to experience almost perpetual famines due to the fact that these resources are not allocated to those who need them but those who make profit out of them. 

So to answer this question: 

&gt; is it the fault of the communist system, when the people are starving, or is it other events in play that cause it?

No, it's technically not, however since the USSR was pretty much the first socialist country, we stumbled our way like a baby in understanding these laws which, because of that, we now have a better view of",True,0,1493648549,,False,0,dgzhqmv,t3_68ln7q,t1_dgzfssb,1496165714,21,False,communism101,t5_2uc81,

They do have a veto over the certification of these schedules. But certification has merely evidentiary weight. It is like coronation. The UK’s scheduled commitments exist even if they are not certified, just as a monarch is a monarch prior to coronation. Indeed, the EU itself has not traded under certified schedules since 1974. The sky has not fallen.""

There is little in practice another WTO member can do to block the UK’s new WTO schedules unless it is for a particular reason, backed with evidence, that is directly related to a trade issue. Any casual veto on certification of new schedules would be a pointless and ineffective gesture.

We also know that ancient Atheneans made yogurt (as easily as they made cheese) and mixed it with spices and garlic or onion. 
The Bysantines inherited all these recipes and improved them, that is, made them more complicated, while Turks went on, keeping the traditional recipes and inventing new variations. 
Let's not forget that sweets covered with honey (sugar to make syrop with was not easy to find) were very popular in Bysantine times, known with the term ""plakountia""... 
Therefore, a lot of recipes which are common in Turkey and in Greece are of ancient greek origin, though the turkish terms predominated because of the formal language of the Ottoman Empire... 
So, yes, dolma, yaprak, lukum (a), baklava, and cacik are of ancient greek origin, at least in their simplier version, adopted by the bysantines, improved by the greeks living in Turkey, and returned to Greece with the refugees in 1922.

TheFifthSoldier,,,"&gt; Rupert Murdoch's £11.7bn takeover bid for Sky will face fresh scrutiny this week with an influential group of politicians set to meet with the telecoms regulator Ofcom to outline their opposition to the move.

&gt; Former business secretary Vince Cable said the group, which includes former Tory Lord Chancellor Ken Clarke, former Labour leader Ed Miliband, and former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, has requested to meet with Ofcom just days after outlining in a letter their concerns over alleged governance failures and a lack of transparency at Murdoch's 21st Century Fox.

&gt; Mr Cable told Press Association: “I, together with various people from different parties - Ken Clarke, Ed Miliband, Lord Falconer - have approached Ofcom and we are going to make representations to them,” he said.

&gt; Mr Miliband's office has confirmed the group has requested a meeting for this week.

&gt; The proposed deal by 21st Century Fox, which has already been approved by EU regulators, is still under review the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and communication regulator Ofcom.

&gt; The watchdogs are investigating if Murdoch is a “fit an proper” owner and if the deal would give him too much control of the UK media.

&gt; Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Karen Bradley pushed the deadline to review the deal, originally set for May 16, out to June 20 as a result of the June 8 general election.

&gt; Under 'purdah' rules, Brady can't make a decision on the deal as restrictions on the conduct of Civil Servants and officials in the pre-election period kicks in from midnight April 21.

&gt; She said: “Given the proximity of this decision to the forthcoming general election and following discussions with the parties, Ofcom, the CMA and the Cabinet Office Propriety and Ethics team I wrote to Ofcom and the CMA on Friday 21 April to extend the period by which these reports should be submitted to Tuesday 20 June.”

&gt; Once the CMA and Ofcom reports have been submitted, the Culture Secretary will decide within 10 days whether to approve the deal or ask for a more in-depth report.

&gt; Fox is bidding to seize control of the 61 per cent of Sky it doesn't already own.

&gt; Rupert Murdoch failed in a previous bid to buy Sky through News Corporation which was scrapped as a result of the phone hacking scandal five years ago when Vince Cable was business secretary.

&gt; Cable had also been stripped of his responsibilities for overseeing media competition after he was secretly recorded by reporters saying he had “declared war” on Murdoch over the takeover attempt.

&gt; Mr Miliband and Mr Cable's group warned in one of its letters to Ofcom this month there was “clear evidence of the Murdochs' pattern of secrecy and lack of transparency about corporate failure being repeated at Fox News, the subject of ongoing Federal investigations”.

&gt; Those allegations stem from Murdoch's handling of sexual harassment allegations against former Fox News chief executive Roger Ailes, who was forced out last summer though he left with a $40 million (£30.9 million) settlement.

&gt; Similar allegations have now led to the exit of onscreen presenter Bill O'Reilly, the April 21 letter to Ofcom noted.

&gt; It added the Murdochs must have either known about the allegations for years and failed to act - or, if they did not know, “must face grave questions about the supervision of their company”.

&gt; “We said in our original letter that no reasonable Ofcom (investigation) could conclude that the Murdochs were fit and proper to take full control of Sky,” the letter states.

&gt; A spokesman for 21st Century Fox (21CF) said the company “has acted swiftly and decisively” to address the sexual harassment allegations at Fox News, adding that it launched an investigation and “secured the CEO's departure” within two weeks of receiving the first complaint about Mr Ailes.

&gt; The group notes it also reached a settlement with the complainant and made an unreserved public apology within the first month.

&gt; “After complaints were made about the behaviour of Mr O'Reilly, 21CF engaged outside counsel to conduct an investigation, which led to Mr O'Reilly's exit and the cancellation of the highest rated cable news show in TV history,” the spokesman said.

They also conveniently ignore many stories that hurt the left, such as the rape crisis in Europe or the problems caused by illegals.

you know, okay, that is your opinion. I think differently

well, thats not right. This sub doesnt even watch LPL or OPL. 

The tournament in question was IEM Cologne at the end of 2015. You surely know how people treat Froskurinn here, it all happened just as you can imagine and she responded with a tweetlonger PR post. 

&gt; Because EU LCS had fewer vets? You're arguing for an unsolvable problem

why? Just as an example, Riot keeps the LPL and OPL broadcast as something more experimental, right? It's been exporting casters for the past seasons and bringing in new ones, so its mainly used as a farm to grow talent. 

I think its great, but why didnt EU LCS get any of the talents there? For example, Papasmithy and Pastrytime are an ancient duo of casters with tons of experience, both of them were out of the major english broadcasts, just casting OPL and LPL stuff. 

For some reason, the region with the most rookies didnt have an interest in bringing them to their broadcast, it seems like EU just dont care, but I think they should.

People wonder why EULCS used to be a lot more closer to NA than now, and it is partly because of little things like these. Fans like personalities, people wont watch Splyce if they dont know who even plays for them, who are the casters or if you barely have information about the game, the hype etc. Unless you are an analyst or something, the average fan likes to feel ""connected"" to what they are watching.

How many were intersted in watching Misfits just because they hired Kakao? Or how many people watched EU LCS back then just because they had Deman? 

It all comes down to marketing your product and its a lot harder to do if you have just a bunch of rookies.

&gt; If you're content being mediocre, sure. I'm not aware of many WTA (winner take all) professions that aren't like that. And casting certainly is one.

Un antifascista jamás duda: Le Pen no es opción

por ANTONIO MAESTRE

http://www.lamarea.com/2017/04/24/antifascista-no-duda-le-pen-jamas/

El 11 de octubre de 1931 se constituyó en Alemania el denominado Frente de Harzburg, una coalición política promovida por la derecha conservadora del multimillonario Alfred Hugenberg que incluía al partido nazi de Adolf Hitler. Con la República de Weimar zaherida y con la agonía del canciller Gustav Stresseman, los conservadores veían en Adolf Hitler la figura carismática que les llevaría al poder. En un mitin conjunto en la ciudad de Bad Harzburg, en la que varios comunistas fueron detenidos por sedición al protestar, el magnate de la prensa y líder del partido conservador DNVP intentó ganarse el favor de Hitler para que encabezara su proyecto. Pero Hitler sabía que no precisaba de su colaboración política, solo de su dinero. Los conservadores de Hugenberg no fueron en coalición con el partido nazi únicamente por la negativa de Hitler. En momentos de tensión política en la que los conservadores vean comprometidos sus privilegios siempre elegirán el fascismo antes que el antifascismo. Ahora toca elegir.

Entre Macron y Le Pen no me queda duda. Macron. La realidad no permite circunloquios y ha situado a la sociedad francesa y europea en este dilema. La izquierda puede centrarse en discusiones inútiles sobre los errores del pasado o qué Europa hemos construido para que se plantee esta disyuntiva tan perjudicial para los trabajadores, pero en quince días el fascismo puede lograr el poder en nuestro vecino del norte si no se impide con el voto. No hay equidistancia posible, cualquier opción política es mejor que Le Pen. Es una falacia establecer que no había alternativas a la extrema derecha o la derecha liberal. Las había pero no lograron llegar a la final. Y ahora hay que decantarse. Un antifascista sabe que cuando la historia pone el fascismo en el camino solo cabe hacerle frente. Sin diatribas ni relatos alternativos. Hay que pararlo.

Emmanuel Macron, un exbanquero de los Rothschild y exministro de Economía del socialismo de François Hollande -uno de los máximos responsables del ascenso del fascismo de Marine Le Pen con sus políticas conservadoras- es una desgracia para los trabajadores de igual porte que lo sería Fillon o lo son Albert Rivera y Mariano Rajoy. Un neoliberal clasista que se dirige a los trabajadores que protestan por la reforma laboral diciéndoles que trabajen para comprarse un traje como el suyo. Políticos como Macron y políticas como las de Macron son las que han llevado a Le Pen a su máximo histórico. No será el antídoto contra el fascismo, es solo un dique de contención que la historia ha puesto en nuestro camino y que dejará latente el problema, si no lo agrava. Pero es el instrumento que la realidad nos ha dado, hay que hacer fuerte el dique ahora, poner sacos terreros y parar la embestida mientras se construye una verdadera alternativa a la extrema derecha que sepulte a Le Pen y a los que como Macron la aúpan con su ideología tóxica para los trabajadores.

En los días previos a las elecciones en Francia, políticos del PSOE, Ciudadanos y el PP, columnistas de extremo centro de El País y toda la oligarquía mediática no dudaron en equiparar a Jean Luc Mèlenchon con Marine Le Pen para armar la estructura que pudiera establecer el relato que permitiera poner a Le Pen como alternativa viable en el caso de que el candidato de izquierdas compitiera con ella en segunda vuelta. Todos aquellos que han equiparado en multitud de ocasiones el antifascismo con el fascismo y el nazismo con el comunismo han construido una Europa que permite que la ideología más criminal de la Europa contemporánea sea vista como una opción tolerable. En el año 2012, mientras Viktor Orban reformaba la constitución para crear campos de trabajo para desempleados o su socio Jobbik realizaba cazas de gitanos en Gyongiospata, la Unión Europea recordaba al premier húngaro que la prioridad era el cumplimiento del déficit y la independencia del Banco Central. Y el virus se siguió propagando.

Partidos como Ciudadanos están intentando dar lecciones de antifascismo porque ahora es cool ir contra Le Pen y apoyar a un candidato de estudio de márketing como Macron. Sin embargo, Albert Rivera fue uno de los que participó de manera más activa en la reactivación de la extrema derecha al participar en una coalición de partidos llamada Libertas para acudir a las elecciones europeas de 2009. Ciudadanos acudió coaligado, por ejemplo, a la Liga de las Familias Polacas, un partido de extrema derecha y xenófobo que tuvo a su líder, Roman Giertych, como viceprimer ministro en el año 2007 y que prohibió hablar de la homosexualidad en las escuelas por sus “creencias como hombre”.

Tener plena consciencia de cuál sería la opción de los antifascistas sobrevenidos en caso de cuestionarse sus intereses no puede marcar el camino de un antifascista convencido. En estos momentos hay que compartir trinchera con los de Macron frente a Le Pen aunque estemos seguros de que nos van a usar como carnaza para el capital. Esa será otra guerra, y ya va siendo hora de que la izquierda sepa cómo afrontarla.

&gt; TOKYO— Nintendo Co. NTDOY 5.62% said it used aircraft to ship its new Switch videogame machine in its first month on the market, an unusual and costly logistics measure responding to unexpectedly high demand.
&gt;
&gt; Earlier, Nintendo said it shipped 2.74 million units of the Switch in the month after it went on sale March 3, up from an initial plan of two million.
&gt;
&gt; “We carried some of the Switches by plane in March to serve our customers more promptly,” a company spokesman said. He said Nintendo switched back in April to less-expensive sea freight to replenish store shelves.
&gt;
&gt; Nintendo didn’t say where the planes were used, but analysts and others briefed on the logistics said the flights took Switch machines to the U.S. and Europe from factories in China.
&gt;
&gt; Ace Research Institute analyst Hideki Yasuda said further use of airfreight was possible because the item remains hard to find at retailers globally. “Air is a big profit-squeezer because it could cost additional ¥5,000 per unit,” or about $45, he said.
&gt;
&gt; Waseda Business School professor Atsushi Osanai said it was worth the price to get the product off to a good start.
&gt;
&gt; “It is important that companies sell as many units as possible, as quickly as possible, while customer interest is high,” he said. The initial months are critical for a game machine, because strong hardware sales drive interest from software creators, and a wealth of software titles in turn generates interest in the hardware.
&gt;
&gt; Nintendo said last week it expected to sell 10 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year, which ends in March 2018. &gt; Analysts say the number could be higher based on initial interest in the machine, which can be used both in the living room and on the go.
&gt;
&gt; “We think the 10 million represents a starting point only,” said Macquarie Capital Securities analyst David Gibson. He expects sales of 14.5 million units or more in the fiscal year.",True,0,1493653471,,False,0,dgzll52,t3_68mmoq,t3_68mmoq,1496167560,95,False,nintendo,t5_2qhnk,

Cara, as agências reguladoras são só mais uma torneira para corrupção. Onde empresários com alianças no governo podem simplesmente comprar licenças. E também podem servir para sufocar qualquer empresa que ofereça um serviço melhor e mais barato que o estado, como estão fazendo com o Uber.

Population decline in Russia happened for a reason, Putin is addressing it in his own way, and well, Europe is also dying if you want to put it like that. Look at the fertility rates. My country Greece for example is at 1.3, that is a demographic disaster, and its not being addressed at all, neither in Greece, neither are European countries doing anything about their own population implosions besides using it as an excuse for more immigration. 

The Russian military is surely not what it was, but look at the UK who can't even afford their own aircraft carriers anymore... neither can France, and these are Western European security council members who are supposed to be doing well in the grand scheme of things. The entire EU couldn't afford to secure Libyan Airspace for more than a week during the 'Arab spring'. The US did that for us. 

I don't feel I need to prove that Russian prospects will improve as that's not really the core of what I am arguing. What I am arguing is that a few ups and downs don't change the big strategic picture much. Germany was crushed in WWII and is still Europe's pre-eminent economy. Russia was crushed by the failure of the Soviet Union, but they are still the big bad bear that western Europe fears. 

At some points in time, one of these 'big power' country's pulls ahead for a while due to inspired leadership, then the laggards gang up on it and restore the balance.. this has been going on for a few hundred years now. If anything, Europe and Russia are entering a protracted but slow decline - together.

An Obscure App Flaw Creates Backdoors In Millions of Smartphones

FOR HACKERS, SCANNING for an open “port”—a responsive, potentially vulnerable internet connection on a would-be victim’s machine—has long been one of the most basic ways to gain a foothold in a target company or agency. As it turns out, thanks to a few popular but rarely studied apps, plenty of smartphones have open ports, too. And those little-considered connections can just as easily give hackers access to tens of millions of Android devices.

A group of researchers from the University of Michigan identified hundreds of applications in Google Play that perform an unexpected trick: By essentially turning a phone into a server, they allow the owner to connect to that phone directly from their PC, just as they would to a web site or another internet service. But dozens of these apps leave open insecure ports on those smartphones. That could allow attackers to steal data, including contacts or photos, or even to install malware.

“Android has inherited this open port functionality from traditional computers, and many applications use open ports in a way that poses vulnerabilities,” says Yunhan Jia, one of the Michigan researchers who reported their findings at the IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy. “If one of these vulnerable open port apps is installed, your phone can be fully taken control of by attackers.”

Port of Call

To determine the full scope of the port problem, the Michigan researchers built a software tool they call OPAnalyzer (for Open Port Analyzer) that they used to scan the code of around 100,000 popular apps in the Google Play app store.

They found that 1,632 applications created open ports on smartphones, mostly intended to allow users to connect to them from PCs to send text messages, transfer files, or use the phone as a proxy to connect to the rest of the internet. Of those, they identified 410 as potentially having no protection or only weak protection—such as a hardcoded password that can be derived from the code and used by any hacker—meant to control who can access those open ports. And of that subset, they manually analyzed 57 that they confirmed left ports open and exploitable by any hacker on the same local Wi-Fi network, another app on the same device (even one with restricted privileges), or more disturbing, a script that runs in the victim’s browser when they merely visit a website.

And that may just be a partial list of exploits, says Zhiyun Qian, a computer scientist at the University of California at Riverside who has followed the Michigan researchers’ work. When a phone’s IP address is publicly visible on the internet—a situation that depends on whether the phone is connected to Wi-Fi and the user’s carrier—the attacker can simply scan for open ports from anywhere, and start attacking that vulnerable phone. In those cases, “this is completely, remotely exploitable,” says Qian. “It’s definitely serious.”

Of the 57 apps they identified as the most vulnerable to the open port attacks, two struck the researchers as particularly dangerous. One app with more than 10 million downloads called Wifi File Transfer allows users to connect to an open port on their phone via Wi-Fi, and access files like photos, application data, and anything stored on the phone’s SD card. But Jia says that due to the app’s lack of any authentication like a password, an intruder who connects to that open port can also get full access to the same sensitive files. “That’s intended functionality for the user, but because of that poor authentication it allows anyone to do it,” Jia says.

The researchers also point to AirDroid, a similarly popular app with an eight-digit number of downloads, designed to allow users full control of their Android phone from their PC. Researchers found that AirDroid had an authentication flaw that also lets malicious intruders access ports. But in AirDroid’s case, that flaw only allowed for the hijacking of existing connections. To perform the attack, malware on the phone would likely have had to intercept the user’s attempt to establish that legitimate connection. And when the Michigan researchers say that AirDroid’s developers patched the problem quickly after being notified.

The developers behind Wifi File Transfer, by contrast, haven’t fixed their app’s security problem even after the researchers contacted them, Michigan’s Jia says. WIRED reached out several times to Smarter Droid, the company that makes the app, but didn’t get a response.

‘The User Can Do Nothing’
In the videos below, the researchers demonstrate attacks on two other apps, PhonePal and Virtual USB, both of which Jia says remain vulnerable. Neither has nearly as many downloads as Wifi File Transfer, however—Virtual USB has less than 50,000, and PhonePal has only a few hundred. Neither company responded to WIRED’s request for comment.

Aside from those four apps, the researchers’ full paper details analyses of half a dozen others—several of which are mostly popular in the Chinese market—that are also vulnerable to varying degrees to open port attacks. More than half the 1,632 apps that create open ports on phones have more than 500,000 downloads, the researchers found.

To test just how widespread the most vulnerable apps might be, they at one point even scanned their local university network and immediately found devices with open, potentially hackable ports. “That so many developers have made this mistake is already an alarming sign,” says UC Riverside’s Qian. “There will be other apps they haven’t looked at, or that other people build in the future that will have the same problem.”

The notion that smartphone apps can open ports and leave them vulnerable has come to light before: In late 2015, the Chinese company Baidu revealed that a software development kit it had developed left open ports on devices where it was installed. Other major Chinese businesses, including Tencent and Qihoo, had already adopted the code, affecting more than 100 million users in total. After Baidu’s admission of the vulnerability the vulnerable apps all released security fixes.

Clearly, though, the problem of open ports in mobile devices persists. And the Michigan researchers suggest that fixing it will require developers to think twice before they open a gaping entry point in your device for remote hackers. “The user can do nothing. Google can do nothing,” says Jia. “The developer has to learn to use open ports correctly.”

Durante a história, ele esboça atitudes muito parecidas com as do Clay, tentando se responsabilizar (e responsabilizar os outros) pela morte da Hannah e pelas merdas que vão acontecendo. Mas o que faz _muita_ falta ao Alex é uma figura como o Tony. Pra piorar, o Alex fica tentando se encaixar no grupo do Justin (onde ele claramente não se encaixa, ele próprio diz isso num episódio).

O Clay, com seu amadurecimento, dá conta de vários dos problemas do colégio que estão nas fitas. O que é dar conta? Tirar o problema das sombras e entregá-lo nas mãos de quem for responsável por ele. A trajetória heroica do Clay puxa muita gente... mas não puxa todo mundo. E isso eu acho bom da história, é bastante realista. Clay não consegue alcançar totalmente o Alex nem o Tyler.

I'd be incredibly surprised if we don't see many thinly veiled racist rulings in France should we see her get in to power even if you believe she isn't. 

Don't get me wrong though, I think the EU is seriously screwing up in Europe and they seem oblivious to confronting people's genuine concerns, bordering racist or otherwise. And let's not bother pretending most of people's issues are anything other than essentially racist, or more succinctly, being worried about the erosion of their country's traditional values. It's a grey area. Am I racist for saying I want my country to keep its traditional values? No. But to maintain those values you'll have to enact racist decrees because your country's traditional values do not align with many people living in your country from foreign descent. So on some level you have to acknowledge that by voting for a nationalistic party, you're knowingly voting in future racist laws. 

And the problem is most people who are strongly nationalistic are essentially pretty unpleasant people. Why would anyone be so defensive about a fucking invisible border and what side of it you were born on? That's so unbelievably pathetic. So vote them in to power and you're going to see some nasty shit go down. If you're proud of seeing families broken  apart in the name of restoring your country's traditions then shame on you. When do we start spitting on foreigners? Evicting them from their businesses and homes? Bulldozing neighbourhoods? Does the thought of that make you proud? Yes I'm taking it far because that's what ultimately happens with right wing/fascist/nationalistic parties. Because that's what they secretly truly want inside. We've witnessed it throughout history and we can witness it in action right now in any country that's ultra nationalist or led by a facist/dictator-esque leader. 

But yes the EU is partly to blame because they have take things too far to the other extreme and not considered how their laws would actually impact people's conscience. They've tried to impose political correctness through acceptance of foreigners when countries weren't fully ready for it or didn't expect how far and how quickly things would change. Yet even now they still dogmatically stick to their guns rather than admit maybe there's a better way. A middle ground.

The trouble is people don't want to wait for the EU to change or accept their mistakes, so instead they invite in the devil. 

And then it's too late for all of us.

DaveChild,eu,UK,"&gt; I'm not sure if that can be attributed solely to EU membership

Without a ""Control UK"" it's never going to be possible to be certain about what would have happened if we'd never joined, or what proportion of our success can be directly or indirectly attributed to our membership. Which is a pity. However, what's easy to see is the poor state of our economy before joining, and the strength of it since. It's very hard to argue it's been damaging when we've gone from being the sick man of Europe to one of its economic powerhouses. I (like almost all Remainers) hope that continues.

&gt; I was trying to illustrate why working class people may have voted the way they did when their vote seems against their own best interests economically.

Personally, I suspect a significant proportion was people voting because of disillusionment. They just wanted to feel like their vote did something, like they counted. It's the same reason, I suspect, a lot of people are voting Tory - they don't think it'll make any difference to them who wins, but at least they'll be on the winning side and feel like they matter.

Watch the Iranian guy at 0:41. ""I've been under Islamic law. I know how it starts and how it ends. It always starts with unity of the left and Islamists.""

Islamists have infiltrated Western governments and activists like Linda Sarsour are rallying up useful idiots to gather support for their cause. Only an idiot could throw on a hijab and consider it ""solidarity"", while ignoring that Muslim women are murdered in the Middle East for their refusal to wear them. The media is heavily promoting them, constantly failing to mention that she is a Sharia Law proponent who has threatened FGM survivors, and shaming anyone who disagrees as an Islamophobe. Thank god we're not in Europe where that rhetoric is criminalized. But rest assure that they will undoubtedly try to push the measures. 

Just look at the media's reaction to FGM taking place right in Detroit or the mass murder of 3 whites by a Nation of Islam member. It was nonexistent. Instead, they pick up immediately on 'TRUMP SUPPORTERS RIP OFF HIJABS' with zero evidence or witnesses. Even when they get debunked, they'll still run stories on how hate crimes have picked up.

You're kidding, right? Because Muslim migration to Western Europe has been such a convincing success story until now. 

&gt;Syrian and Albanian Muslims make up the majority and they aren't like the Muslim strawman. 

If Syria was as awesome as you seem to believe, than why is it as dysfunctional and volatile as the rest of the Arab world? Just because you've probably read somewhere that Syria is super-progressive (compared to what? Saudi-Arabia?) and also wish it must be true doesn't automatically make it so. 

And even if that wasn't the case (which it is), there'd still be the problem that Syrians aren't the highly educated professionals the fake news propagated by the hypocrites of the regressive left made them out to be. In fact, they'll be very very very expensive for us - we (Germany) are already at 40 billion € after less than 2 years, and the cost will only snowball from there: more expenses for security (our already overburdened police force is now beyond its limits), long-term opportunity costs for education (because not only do migrants require additional education to catch up, they also lower the overall educational standard due to teachers being preoccupied with them, which in turn has long-term consequences on the competitiveness of our economy... shall I go on?

So I suppose what I'm asking more about, which the OP to this thread answered, is why there is a comparatively large Muslim polulation in Europe, which seems to be the need for import labor, which led to mosques being founded by import countries, which opened the gates to Wahabbi radicals. I assume coupled with the EU demanding y'all take all those refugees, which surely increased your Muslim pop by a lot, looking at most cities being 15%-25% Muslim, that it creates a powder keg with so many Muslims in small areas and radical mosques reaching them all.

davidoffetx,,Sobranie,"Hey guys, just got my order from Cigsspot; I have never ordered from them before, only Ciggiesworld. I'm posting a complete review for them and the cigs that I tried from them.

**Ease of ordering**: decent site, I wanted some cigs not on their site, and after corresponding with them, they let me know they could get them. The cigs they got for me not on their site were the Sobranie Black Russians, and Gauloises Blondes. The Black Russians were pretty expensive and ran about $65 for a carton. I also ordered Davidoff Classic, Marlboro Red, and Sobranie Black. They use bitcoin, so this is a bit of a pain, especially for large orders because it is difficult to buy bitcoin online and inconvenient. 

**Shipping**: They told me about a 5 days to North America, and this was exactly correct. Shipping out of their location was delayed because of a snowstorm that hit Europe in late April, this is not Cigsspot's fault because the shippers delayed pickup. Cigsspot gave me updates the whole way through, so they did a great job here. I ordered almost exactly 2 weeks ago, and I just got them. They have very fast shipping, which is a big plus.  Shipping ran about $50, which is really high, but hey, at least it gets to you fast.

**Service**: Really good, they seem a lot more attentive than Ciggiesworld, and really were on top of their game on this. For reference, I made an order with Ciggiesworld at roughly the same time and still have not gotten it (it is confirmed now that it is impossible for Ciggiesworld Cigs to get to the US now via air, so shipping to US now takes 3 months) I asked them for suggestions for the next order and they gave them to me, also I had some further special requests for next order, and they were able to tell me what they could and couldn't get. 

**Cigarettes**: 
**Sobranie Black Russian**- Really good smoke. Standard EU packaging (said duty free on the box), thankfully not in a plain package, which they are now in, in England. These were the most expensive cigs I got. Beautiful packaging and these cigs were really good, really smooth, sweet and spicy. Highly aromatic. Based on previous experience smoking them in Europe and elsewhere, very in line with my previous experience. These are a 10/10 for me.

**Gauloises Blondes**- These are some of my favorite cigs, period. They're plain packaged in France now, which is a shame, but thankfully Cigsspot's came in EU Duty Free packaging. They are really smooth and have a great taste. For me, these are a 9/10 and some of my all time favorites. They seem impossible to get now, and Ciggiesworld doesn't sell them. So bravo Cigsspot for finding these for me!

**Sobranie Black**- I think these are a Moldovan cig b/c I was never able to find them in England, but I could be wrong. These have less nicotine than the Sobranie Black Russian and the Gauloises, but they still are a middle of the road cig, even though Sobranie is a luxury brand. Good taste, very mild, not as spicy and aromatic as the Black Russian. These would be solid for a daily go-to smoke and the packaging is beautiful. Also gotta love the Sobranie logo on the filter. These also have a recessed filter like a Parliament which is cool, I guess. 8.25/10.

**Marlboro Red**- I love the packaging on European Red's, so much more appealing than North American packaging. I think these are special Moldovan ones, and they say something on the pack about a ""Hard Filter"", whatever that means. Very mild like the Sobranie Black. I would give them a 7.5/10 because of mild nicotine content, but the redeeming factor is the amazing packaging.

**Davidoff Classic Red**- One of my favorite all time smokes. Very standard Davidoff packaging that you will find worldwide. These are also 100's which is a plus. Good taste, smooth smoke, better nicotine and tar content than the Marlboros and the Sobranie Blacks. These get an 8.75/10.

All these smokes were manufactured in Ukraine or Moldova as far as I can tell, they may taste different from Western European cigs of the same brand and type. As far as I know these are all non-FSC and don't have the noticeable chemical taste to them. The Sobranie Black Russians and Gauloises Blondes both were in duty free packaging with English warning s on them. 

I certainly will be ordering from Cigsspot again based on selection, fast shipping, and great service. I def. think these guys are worth it. Final note, you have to order 5 cartons minimum for US, unless you wanna pay a really high shipping rate for one or two cartons. These guys are great. 5/5 overall.",True,0,1493658442,,1493669748,0,dgzptd7,t3_68n2nj,t3_68n2nj,1496169595,1,False,Cigarettes,t5_2qjd2,

ATMs are all over the place, check with your bank what the fees would be.  Depending on your bank, they may have partner banks in Holland that would have significantly lowered fees, even half the fees.  ATMs are the best way to get cash, best exchange rates and you don't get screwed like at the foreign exchange kiosks.  I would recommend getting cash as soon as you land at the airport.  Make sure you inform your bank that you are traveling or else they may deny any and all transactions based on the assumption that your card was stolen and then you'd have to contact them to unlock your card.

I've not mentioned the NHS in the OP, the issue is with his incorrect claim that membership of the EU costs us £385m a week, not what he said it could be spent on instead.

He now takes every opportunity possible on his radio show to claim that he *never* said that membership of the EU costs £350m a week, whether to go to the NHS or not. But this is a lie. Why is Farage lying?

VegetaLF7,20,,"One of the things I really enjoyed about lightsaber dueling, at least in the EU, was the concept that there was a battle of the minds going on at the same time. Each fighter is attempting to use the Force to out maneuver their opponent, predict where they'll go, try and sabotage each other, and so on. One of the first skills an EU Force user learns is to create a barrier around them to prevent the opponent from simply switching their blade off with the Force, or something similar. Given Jedi and Sith are practically superhuman with the ability to predict the future, it helps explain why their saber duels last so long compared to a proper swordfight. If you can predict exactly what your opponent will do, and they do the same to you, you both are constantly going to be countering each other until one slips up. As the fight nears the conclusion, one fighter will make a mistake or just wear out long enough to leave an opening for their opponent to end it. Lightsaber duels are as much a battle of attrition as they are individual skill.

An excellent example of this is in the Darth Bane novels. Bane's apprentice, Zannah, is a petite woman armed with a double-bladed saberstaff like what Darth Maul would eventually use. The thing was, her blades were far shorter than Maul's. During one particular fight, she was defending herself from multiple Jedi. These Jedi were better swordsmen than she was, but she had mastered a defensive style and simply focused on protecting herself from the Jedi attacks until they slipped up long enough for her to take advantage of it and kill one quickly.",True,0,1493660908,,False,0,dgzry7i,t3_68gfqi,t3_68gfqi,1496170622,1,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,

Is it common? Very. When I tell someone that virtually my whole family lives in one city, they're shocked as that is rare.

&gt;Is it considered 'weird' for Americans to live in close proximity to their families?

No, but a lot of young people are usually itching to move far away from where they were raised because it's ""boring"" or ""uninteresting"". However, we are the opposite here. We move to the boring places because we can't afford to live in our home town.

&gt;Assuming a normal family relationship, how often do you see your parents if you live more than 200 miles away?

Ever since I moved out, I've lived about 50 miles away from my parents. I've worked for the family business, so in that case, I'd see them everyday. But other than that, holidays or the occasional dinner on the weekend.

&gt;Is moving from one state to another considered a big deal (like leaving your country of birth in Europe is) or is it considered very normal? Is it easy, bureaucracy-wise?

As far as I know, it's easy. The only thing I can think you'd need to do is update driver's license and registration? Also, your taxes could change as some states do/do not have Income Tax, etc.

Very common. My parents for example are from different states and later married in a state that they both weren't born in.

It might a little bit for people who go to out of state university and end up staying there, but other than that, I don't think so. I hear more about people moving away out of desperation or for opportunity and they weren't very educated.

BritRedditor1,,(((neoliberal))) [metropolitan] [globalist] elite,"IF INSANITY is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, British politicians’ repeated promises on immigration might well be judged to be mad. In 2010 David Cameron vowed to reduce net migration (immigration minus emigration) to the tens of thousands. Theresa May, his home secretary and now successor as prime minister, has intimated that she will stick to this target in her Tory party’s manifesto for the forthcoming election. So far the promise has proved impossible to keep. Last year net migration was 273,000, even higher than in 2010.

Debate over immigration and how best to control it has become no less feverish since Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. Yet given how politicised the net migration figure has become, the data behind it are surprisingly unreliable.

The statistic is based on the International Passenger Survey. The IPS dates back to 1961, when the government established a travel and tourism survey to gather information about the movement of people. It was not designed to be the basis for measuring immigration but has since become so because Britain does not ask migrants to register after their arrival.

Between 6am and 10pm officials at ports and airports ask travellers questions about themselves, their destination and the purpose of their entry. Between 700,000 and 800,000 interviews are conducted a year (in 2015 foreigners made more than 36m trips to Britain). The data for the net migration figures are extrapolated from 4,000-5,000 interviews of people identified as long-term international migrants. The UK Statistics Authority admits that the margins of uncertainty are wide.

Britain is rare in using this kind of survey to count migrants, says Carlos Vargas-Silva of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. In the EU, Cyprus is the only other country to do so. Countries such as America use household surveys. In 2015 Britain introduced a form of exit controls using information provided by airlines. But since it is not connected to the Home Office’s data on visas, it is no help in calculating levels of immigration, points out Mr Vargas-Silva.

Recently debate has focused on whether to remove foreign students from the overall figure, something Mrs May is apparently resisting. Those in favour argue that since overseas students stay only temporarily, are of little concern to the public (even those who want to reduce immigration substantially are relaxed about students, surveys show) and bring particularly clear economic benefits, they should be treated separately from other migrants.

That is all true, but taking students out of the migration calculations might not change the net figure much. It is increasingly difficult for them to stay in Britain after their studies; the government abolished post-study work visas in 2012. There is little evidence that many stay on illegally. That suggests the inflow and outflow should roughly balance out, meaning there would be little impact on the net migration figure if they were removed from it.

The IPS is particularly inaccurate when looking at subsets of migrants, such as students, since the sample size is even smaller. Alternatives to the current measure, such as household surveys, would be more reliable. Determining more accurately how many foreigners arrive in and leave Britain might be a good start to deciding immigration policy—and maybe even coming up with a more sensible one.",True,0,1493661899,,False,0,dgzsthz,t3_68nld3,t3_68nld3,1496171039,0,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,

([link](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2016:165:FIN))

As I said as well in the previous post, many, many more migrants enter Italy, Spain and Greece, but these countries are NOT allowed to send the migrants to other EU countries, without their permission.

If a country, like Germany, WANTS to intake more refugees, they CAN, they are a sovereign state. But they are NOT required to under EU law. 

Also, Germany can spend as many euros as they want on migrants. Again, they are a sovereign country and no EU law limits the amount or sets a minimum either. France is not required to spend as much. 
In reality, countries that take migrants under the relocation program are given money to cover the expenses.

And the EU citizens have been consulted twice: in 2014, when they directly elected the European Parliament, and whenever they voted for their head of state, because as I said the European Council (who voted for the relocation program) is formed by the heads of state of each EU member. So yes, we have been consulted, thank you for your concern.

miumiumiau,,,"Flipping clothes and toys on our version of Craigslist or baby bazars and flea-markets has become quite popular in Germany. 

It is to a degree about being frugal but also about reducing waste and recycling. 

For example: it is common for German parents to rather buy Bisgaard winter boots 2nd hand for €80 since these are chemical free and ethically produced in a EU country than to buy new  shoes which were produced in China for €30. 

Same goes for other clothes. Whilst it is ok to get a few items from the mass-production shops like H&amp;M or Primark, people would rather spend the same or a bit more for a high quality brand such as Finkid. 


About 60% of kids clothes I buy used via online communities but make sure they are in excellent used or as new condition. These are usually quality brands with high resale value. 

 New clothes and toys make up around 30%. I get mainly outdoor wear, shoes and underwear new. I buy them heavily discounted via Amazon Warehouse or shops like our version of TJ Maxx so when I sell them for 50% of their retail price I make a bit extra.

10% I find on flea markets and baby bazars but mostly these items I use as spare clothes in day care so if they get lost I dont feel sad about them.

I'm involved in a refugee project here and if I hear of a family needing something that I have in my sales container they get it.

I don't know, and I don't know if such research exists in a similar fashion to this, but I think it's unfair to simply assume an answer to that question. Also, if Islam truly is the source of these types of evil problems, why did Muslims in Eastern/Southern Europe have such significantly more peaceful views?

It's realism.

Maybe that's what is needed


&gt;where tons of people die.


Sadly that's the only way the israeli mainstream cares at all. When jews die they start caring and finding solutions, when arabs die it's a normal day.


See how the first intifada pushed israel into the oslo negotiations and even that was done in bad faith.



&gt;The whole ""they are evil"" just ends up resulting in violence and death.


Palestinians get shot in the back often, so nothing new about this. People always die.



&gt;And Its also untrue, about most things.  




Yeah it's true. The day israel decides to do something, they actually do it. When they wanted to ethnically cleanse the place they did it. When they wanted to annex East Jerusalem and the golan they made a law. When they wanted to disengage from gaza and keep a blockade they did just that. When they want to build a settlement or assassinate someone they do without care for the west. I could go on. Israel is the only player in the game. Israel is the only occupier. Israel holds all the important cards. And all of Israel is accessory to its crimes one way or another. Israeli citizens either help the occupation by going to the military, paying taxes, spreading propaganda, embellishing its image by meaningless gestures, migrating to israel and gaining rights just because they're jews or having babies to disenfranchise the arab population.



I frankly don't see any solution, only conflict. The day will come when Israeli jews finish the job of 48, or at least attempt to. Any temporary solutions are just putting lipstick on a pig as they say, just normalizing the occupation and trying to brainwashing Palestinians into submission.




I have seen your other post in the israeli sub and I'm more convinced of the intractability of the conflict. The right is the powerful part in israel. The left is getting more right wing. Many posters didn't acknowledge the discrimination or the need to change anything and put the onus on the Palestinians. Another one used the same old european argument, ""they're savages and don't deserve a functioning state until they solve honor killing and corruption"". Israel and most israelis are a lost cause.

There's definitely a segment of the population that has an ... *overly protective* relationship with guns, even for minor stuff; and these people are often affiliated with the political orientation that is against a close relationship with the EU. As for Schengen itself: there has been a very steep degradation of the popular view of the various agreement we have with the EU over the past few years, so it's difficult to give an accurate estimate of the majority opinion atm. This shift is due to Brussel's increasingly extreme attitude in the affair of freedom of movement (e.g. even to have an EU-compatible solution we had to do it unilaterally as the other side refused any dialogue whatsoever until very recently. And just to show it to them the whole country had to wait 2 weeks until our president was allowed to bring it to Juncker during an obscure meeting in Mongolia - but only during the coffee break); it's mounting pressure in trying to get us to sign their very demanding points for an institutional agreement (e.g. refusing to sign Swiss suggestions for agreements since several years now (but apparently signing an automatic information exchange deal is not a problem), even threatening to let major existing treaties expire without renewing them - and now there are rumours that they want us to sign it all before the end of the year, so as to have it done before Brexit is completed).

SailornyanLove,,,"It's quite common for nurses to be working 12 hour shifts though, and if the wages are falling further behind then they'll most likely be working more hours. Also since leaving the eu and cuts to student bursaries for nurses there will be less nurses overall, again meaning nurses are being over stretched. If you're over stretched it's quite common to pay more for things that save you time because you don't have time. We can't know their situations, we don't know if there were family issues, social problems. The problem is it isn't just wage growth that's the issue, it's rental prices, benefits cutbacks etc. we don't know how many of these things hit certain sections of society harder. Most nurses I know come from poorer backgrounds to start with, anecdotal entirely but my point being there could be other factors at play here that haven't been researched beyond simply their wage growth.

That's not true actually, I don't exactly know when 'your day' was but it wasn't uncommon for people to buy furniture etc. in increments, it's just that debt has become a more pervasive element of society and initially the banks were the ones pushing it for their profit. Need a car, even a second hand one is a huge financial commitment and a prerequisite for many jobs, need a house? debt, need to rent? deposit, rising rents. Public transport? Rising bus fares, poor service. There are more and more drains on people's incomes and more contracts involved. I don't think it's really a choice for many people. I also think you're talking rubbish when you allude to people abusing a support network. Food banks aren't government run, and they decide need independently, so if they decide nurses need the food then we have no right to be moralising over who's really deserving.

Everyone in society benefits from welfare, middle class to upper class people receive welfare in the form of fiscal welfare, such as tax credits, working tax credits blah blah, but this doesn't carry social stigma too it and no one moans about whether people really deserve it. Pensions also make up the majority of the budget for welfare and NI contributions do not even begin to cover it, however it is expected for people not to save for old age and rely on their state pension instead even if they are high income, something that won't be available for following generations but again we would never say well they ought to have planned ahead. To contrast this under 25s no longer are eligible for housing benefit. I should imagine a lot of under 25s who don't live at home do so because they have home life problems not because they want to roll around in housing benefit money which doesn't cover the average rent anyway. Most people receiving welfare are working and their wages have to be supplements and most people on unemployment benefit are on in for less than 6 months (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/06/welfare-britain-facts-myths). So this idea that people are frittering away their money or reliant on welfare is a myth. The concept of the undeserving poor has been trotted out since the Victorian era and it really needs putting to bed but it seems really hard for people to just look around and go actually things are pretty shit at the moment, even if they aren't for me.

It's also shown that statistically people in their 20s are going out much less actually, drinking less doing less drugs and generally spend their leisure time indoors. So we get blamed for pubs shutting... but we're also apparently responsible for social ills of binge drinking. Honestly you simply can't win.

I think your views aren't really based on facts I think you just look down on 'people nowadays'. You simply have a narrative you've plucked out of the air, but it's been disproven multiple times. In this particular case of these nurses there isn't any social research on it and probably it would take a long to do so, but looking at the state of things in general I think it's quite likely they're not doing it for laughs. It's incredibly embarrassing for people to have to go to food banks, no one does that for fun.

That said, I've recently taken to study Hungarian, mainly out of curiosity.

&gt; Estamos a falar de uma verdadeira indústria que antecede a própria existência da nação portuguesa, e até há poucos anos ainda era praticada extensivamente em território africano.

continuas a bater no ceguinho... mas dá-lhe.

&gt; Durante aquela época até havia escravistas africanos a atacar o território europeu, inclusive da coroa portuguesa, para raptar europeus para alimentar o comércio de escravos. Até há episódios de ataques de escravistas africanos que ficaram no imaginário português, como o ataque à ilha de Porto Covo durante o século XVIII que deu origem à lenda da nossa senhora da queimada.

e? o que é que esse episódio do séc. XVIII prova em relação ao Antão Gonçalves ter iniciado o comércio de escravos em 1441?

&gt; E tu pões-te a falar em iniciar comércio de escravos africanos?

In  contrast,  annual  colony  losses  seem  to  be  driven  mainly  by  the  spread  of introduced pathogens and pests, and management problems due to a long-term intensification of production and  the transition  from  large numbers  of  small apiaries  to fewer,  larger operations.  ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496582)

It's not an apples to apples comparison when you evaluate a highly heterogeneous country against mostly homogeneous ones.

fatal_strategy,,,"Socialism isn't a single ideology though. It's actually a broad movement that within it has many arrangements who butt heads frequently. Anarchists, Marxists-Leninists, and Luxemburgists are all socialists but they frequently criticize and debate each other. 

Of course you could say that this is a moot point since I am advocating for a single type of socialism, but I'm not, and you broadly attacked socialism and communism as such for limiting freedom. This is a pretty weak argument as there have been instances where Socialists of various flavors have improved society. As I said before, if it wasn't for the work of socialist organizations, including the CPUSA(communist) and the IWW (anarchist-leaning) the New Deal probably wouldn't have come about. It's the same in the Social Democracies of Scandinavia and other European welfare states. Those concessions were only wrought through strong labor movements that existed because socialists organized them. If socialism as such limits freedom how is this possible. 

As far as my claim that we already live in authoritarianism perhaps I was being hyperbolic but I definitely don't think you can argue that we are as free as we think.

PM_ME_YOUR_PM_PHOTOS,,,"&gt; the old EU was pretty bad for everybody being connected to everybody in some way. In a universe as big as the SW one is there should be some people even amongst the elite who simply didn't know or didn't even know of each other. The SW universe is massive it should feel that way.

Yet, when Finn and Rey just happened to find the Millenium Falcon, it just happened to be Han Solo that picked them up. And it just happened to be Han's son they end up fighting - who just happens to be the grandson of the original angsty baddie in a black mask.

&gt; it would necessitate some reason being devised to handwave why yoda would t do anything about Snoke, and why he didn't tell the Jedi about him, if he did they need a reason why the Jedi hid it instead of adding it to their archive in which case the emperor would have known about him which we know he did not.

Why didn't Yoda do anything about Sidious and Vader? If it turns out that Snoke is more powerful than even Sidious, seems silly to expect Yoda to do anything to try and stop him. And why didn't he tell the Jedi? Maybe doing so would have led to the destruction of the order.

&gt;Snoke is from the unknown regions, if we start explaining everything from there as less unknown and more little known then it makes it less a mysterious largely unexplored region and more a region everyone is inexplicably tight lipped about.

Fair point. Mystery can definitely be a powerful storytelling device.

&gt; yoda and the Jedi not dealing with Snoke puts him into the level of the superman-esque force users who were mostly removed with the EU which is something I'm appreciative of. I like the idea of yoda / Anakin being in the uppermost echelon of force users period, not middle of the range when compared to other powerful users.

I'm not sure I get what you're saying. He doesn't have to be twice as powerful as Anakin. In fact I think it's more interesting if Snoke is the most powerful dark side user, kept alive by the power of the force, whose powers Anakin approached but never quite achieved. But that's purely a matter of opinion.

&gt; it seems like the theory is based solely around ""wouldn't a Snoke - yoda fight be cool?"" 

If ""solely"" is what you really mean, I don't think you've really read the post or any of my comments. The theory doesn't require that they've engaged in a duel, but yeah, that would be pretty awesome. Perhaps Snoke was a member of the jedi order. Maybe he was Yoda's master, or Yoda his. Maybe something else entirely happened - I think it's most likely that Snoke is a dark side user who had galactic ambitions a long time ago, failed, got his scars, and spent a long time setting himself up to take power, and the First Order was his opportunity to do so. That he ""watched the Empire rise and fall"" is consistent with this, but yeah, it's all speculation.

rodditt,,,"&gt;Não está estourada. Já vi algumas granadas soltando um pouco de fumaça antes do estouro, mas nunca no mesmo volume depois de estourada.

Então para de cagar regra de como é se nem sempre é do jeito que você disse. Cara, tu nem sabia onde estava a polícia. Você fica falando, eu fico mostrando como o que você fala não se corrobora pelas imagens. Sua linha de argumentação é o tempo todo quebrada e está agora criando exceções aos seus ""fatos"" que expôs só porque viu que eles contrariam sua fala. Se mostro como o vídeo não corrobora suas alegações você as relativiza e ainda quer usá-las como absolutas? Seja ao menos honesto na argumentação.

&gt;Veja a diferença do diâmetro da fumaça de quando a polícia joga para o momento que ela é arremessada ao palco. Não acredita em mim? Procure vídeos sobre granadas.

Claro, pois são duas granadas diferentes.

&gt;Você disse que era impossível, não é. Ele pegou a granada e jogou no palco o mais rápido possível para não inalar fumaça. Nem dá para ver para onde ele está olhando. Mesmo que ele não estivesse olhando para lá, o fato dele desviar o olhar não muda o fato de que não é impossível que ele tenha jogado a granada lá só pela sua posição física. Eu consigo reproduzir aquele movimento sem dificuldade.

Sim, disse que era impossível, realmente não é impossível, mas totalmente improvável. Você querer defender seu ponto com um movimento completamente disfuncional não tem sentido. Se o momento é de confusão você vai lançá-la do modo mais fácil e natural, não do mais complicado. Sim, dá pra ver pra onde ele está olhando. E não faz sentido você dizer que ele jogou fora o mais rápido possível se ele calmamente se abaixa pra pegá-la.

http://portaldoprofessor.mec.gov.br/storage/discovirtual/galerias/imagem/0000000089/0000006227.jpg

É mais ou menos assim a posição dele, só que ele faz um arco com o antebraço direito, enquanto na foto ele empurra o peso.

É claro pela imagem do movimento do cara que não foi ele quem jogou a bomba que vai pro palco. O cara de preto é o único fato e a principal alegação de que a bomba não veio da polícia. Se você desmonta o fundamento da hipótese, ela toda cai por terra.

&gt;Vamos aos fatos:

&gt;Polícia joga a granada ainda não estourada (verificado pelo ínfimo volume de fumaça saindo dela).

Isso não é fato, você já relativizou a bomba, não pode usá-la como absoluto. Sem falar que não é ínfimo. A diferença entre a quantidade de fumaça no trajeto e no chão é num momento estar em movimento, dispersando o gás e em outro parada, concentrando.

&gt;Granada cai no chão e começa a exalar o gás.

Não, ela já exalava

&gt;O cara se abaixa exatamente em cima da granada, pega ela e arremessa. O tempo de arremesso da granada é precisamente sincronizado com o tempo do movimento do cara. Visão interrompida pelo deputado.

Sim.

&gt;Visão volta. A granada sumiu do chão e o único o rastro de gás que ela deixa traça completamente do chão, à altura do corpo do cara, ao arremesso, ao palco.

Isso aqui não é verdade, se você usar o carrinho como referência vai ver que ela vem de trás dele e que a fumaça na frente dele já era a que acumulou enquanto ele a segurava.

Votação, grandes merdas, isso não é candidatura. Estamos argumentando (pelo menos eu estou)

JesterTheZeroSet,,,"&gt; I also dropped out of university in early 20s. There were few reasons why that happened but simply put I didn't care about it anymore and it got to stressful for me.

Too right! I hated my first year, but quite enjoyed the second one. The third one was alright, but in my last semester, everything went to shite fast. I had no money, no job, my father was having finacial problems, and my mother was being a bitch to all of us. Combine everything and it was a bomb ready to go off.

&gt;After that I worked in call centers for 3 years since I can speak 3 languages and oh boy that didn't help at all because the job is boring, quite stressful and as you pointed out it pays crap(living in small eastern Europe country doesn`t help either). And I had daily 1 hour commute to job and 1 hour from it since I live outside the city so I spent more than 30% of my earnings on fuel.

I have come to the thought of being able to speak more than one language, is sort of a curse to me. Everyone comes to me to ask me for favours; translate this, translate that; write this, write that... 
The payment was alright compared to the average salary here in my country, but combined with public transport and food, it was like half of my income. Also, I really hate speaking over the phone, but it was the only job I had (and that I was being offered somewhere else).

&gt;I also like to joke about dying, killing myself, not feeling the drive etc., but since a lot of people think Im a chill dude they just take it as a joke. As OP said ""I'm just living because my friends and family need me"" not because I want to. 

My close mates know that I really mean it, but they don't say anything shite like 'don't do it' or 'God has a plan for all of us' Since I'm an atheist, they all know that that wont do jack to me, hahaha.
About being alive because someone else... maybe because of my dog. I know he'd die if I'm gone.

&gt;I`m now in my late 20s with no goals and constantly feeling empty, working random construction jobs because being busy helps not to think. And yeah I know that I most likely have depression but as with everything I dont care that much.

Here`s to better days I guess. Cheers!

Too right! Feeling empty, like if you were floating over your own existence, knowing there's a world out there, but not for you. I just hate being alive.

Too better days, Cheers!

tormenteddragon,whm-sprite,White Mage,"People seem to be implying that not much has been said on the battle system changes. But quite a lot of their thinking has been laid out.

**The 4 main combat system changes:**

- Keeping the total number of actions the same even with the new ones added from 61-70 by reworking currently underutilized skills
- Reduce the emphasis on monitoring buff icons by implementing job-specific UI elements
- Reworking the cross-class skills system to consolidate additional actions based on role
- Rework or remove certain secondary stats such as piety, accuracy, parry, block rate/strength etc.

The goal is to narrow the DPS gap between casual and hardcore players, but allow for a slight widening of the gap between intermediate and hardcore (i.e. based on player skill). They also want to strengthen job identity. 

&gt; **Yoshida:** We will remove useless parts in order to strengthen party cooperation and skill rotation. By making the system simpler, we can go much deeper with the battle system. But, we don’t plan to widen the gap among players because of player skill, so I think that the gap will be somewhat filled between casuals and hardcore players. However, you will see a gap open between intermediate and advance players.

Reminder that not all of this is final - it's still in development.

&gt; **Yoshida:** **I have to repeat myself again, but what i talked about today are just examples. I don't mind players debating over what was said in this interview, but i'd like them to avoid discussing it in an assertive manner. From my perspective, i can declare that ""I'm explaining it after telling them none of it is final, so even if misunderstandings take place at that moment, it won't affect the final implementations"", but the development team really worries and cares about those vague misinterpretations, no matter how hard they try not to care about it. So please remember none of this is final.**

**Adjusting number of skills**

- Removing or reworking under-utilized skills (examples given: MNK Featherfoot, WAR Wrath and Abandon stacks united into one guage, Thunder II and III removed and Thunder's potency made stronger with levels)

- New skills will be obtained from both leveling and Job quests

- The goal is to have players use roughly the same number of skills at 70 as at 60. Although the total number of skills per job will likely increase, rotations should largely be of similar length.

- Some core skills like Enochian may be gained at an early level

- PvP actions are also being adjusted [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5yn588/new_pvp_information_for_40/) and [Source](https://www.bluegartr.com/threads/129618-Yoshida-on-Patch-3.5-Famitsu-Interview-Translation)

**Job-specific UI elements**

- Still not certain whether *all* jobs will have new UI elements

- Certain job-specific actions will get special, themed UI elements (examples given: BLM Enochian, MNK Greased Lightning, DRK Darkside, DRG Blood of the Dragon, WAR Wrath/Abandon)

- Core job actions will shift from penalties for messing up to bonus damage for playing well - i.e. the damage floor will be raised (example given: Enochian could become a permanent buff, but there'll be things you can do to boost your damage while it's up)

- DoTs will still have to be managed as usual

**Cross-class system replaced with cross-role actions**

- Similar skills will be unified allowing for each job to be more unique - i.e. strengthen job identity (example given: PLD's Rampart and DRK's Shadowskin could be unified into one cross-role skill, [Cleric stance and Esuna have been hinted at as becoming cross-role skills](http://jp.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/002020.html))

- Mainly damage up and debuff abilities will be in the shared category

- Physical melee and physical ranged will likely be separate, but physical ranged and magical ranged will likely share abilities

- Shared actions will likely be shifted to an earlier level so that the demands of leveling other classes to gain vital abilities for your main job will be somewhat mitigated. ""Extra classes to unlock jobs are also going away in 4.0 as a part of the streamlining of the game’s battle system."" [Source](http://massivelyop.com/2017/03/11/pax-east-2017-naoki-yoshida-on-final-fantasy-xivs-new-jobs-old-jobs-and-future-patches/)

- ""**Yoshida:** We want to make it so that you can change which abilities you use depending on the content and other party member""

- If the class system were to be removed (i.e. base classes rolled into their respective jobs) it won't be until 5.0 or later

**Adjusting certain stats**

- Some stats such as accuracy and parry may be reworked or removed entirely. Piety and block rate/strength have also been mentioned [Source - Dengeki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5wt5am/jp_blog_summary_of_famitsu_dengeki_and_game_watch/)

Eu não recomendaria assistir documentários pelo YouTube, tem muita coisa desatualizada ou tendenciosa ao nazismo (vide documentários sobre tecnologia ou doutrinas militares); também falta um cuidado por parte de quem upa em disponibilizar a ficha técnica do documentário, então fica quase impossível achar informações sobre a produção.

MiniiN1nja,team 00,Hey,"I'm going to try. So there are the five major regions which are: Korea (LCK), NA (LCS), China (LPL), EU (LCS), Taiwan (LMS)

Each of these respective have their own regions have their own leagues in which mostly 10 or more teams participate in. Riot (creators of League) only host 3 events per year.

First off it's MSI which is currently ongoing. Every Team that won their respective region's Spring Split is going to be participating. Weaker regions such as Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Japan are participating in this event at the moment and are going to decide who will get their spot at MSI.

Secondly we have Worlds, now the qualification for this differs for every region, I'm just going to talk about NA and EU since they're both the same. The winner of the Summer Split Playoffs will automatically be send as (first seed) for their region, I believe this is the same for most regions. Second seed will be the team with the most points. Remember Spring Split? Well the higher you end placing in Playoffs, the more points you will receive. Third seed is based off another small tournament where all the playoff teams receive another chance to make it to Worlds as third seed. 

Thirdly we have All-Stars where we the fans can fan vote for players to participate. It's a fun event so there's not much to say. 1v1, fun game modes, etc.

I recommend tuning into MSI when the main event starts (Wednesday), you will see the best teams of each respective region.

Brasileiro então? Nossa, não tem respeito, enquanto muitos fóruns internacionais tem uma repressão forte pra evitar desrespeito e outras coisas parecidas (até porque pode se perder patrocínio!), nos BR é tudo liberado.

Você quer conversar com o sujeito, o indivíduo vem pra cima de você com sete pedras na mão, xingando, chamando você de burro ou inocente caso pense diferente. Como Fórum é muito mais restrito, menos centros de informação, menor público, as pessoas logo se emputecem com essas palhaçadas e vazam. Fica só a turminha de babacas dominando e tornando o espaço insustentável.

Aqui no Reddit eu vejo muito mais respeito, ainda que ocorra algumas coisas, tem uma diversidade enorme. Num post o povo endeusa Dória, no outro os caras criticam quem endeusa Dória, e nem por isso os primeiros vão lá provar sua ""masculinidade"". Discussão política sempre é maçante de assistir, complicada, mas aqui eu noto que há um nível de respeito maior, ainda que haja insulto (difícil inexistir). Além disso, postagens como a suas, sinceras, abertas, que reclamam com transparência, são levadas a sério e sempre tem uma quantidade razoável de pessoas a ajudar (pedi ajuda no meu TCC aqui, por exemplo). Fora que os mods são mais atentos e conseguem coibir melhor as tretas.

Enfim, o que tenho a dizer pra você, OP, é que existe lugar muito pior, e o Reddit é um avanço enorme. Sim, tem esse sarcasmo, essas besteiras, mas estamos vivendo um momento político conturbado e hipócrita, onde o humor e sarcasmo serve pra chamar atenção de muitas coisas. Pela diversidade, tem muita gente mais nova, o que pra quem é mais velho que eles sempre é bobeira, etc.

Meu conselho? Leva na boa, não se irrita com isso porque a única pessoa que sofre consequências é você mesmo por se afastar de um espaço que se sente bem. Sempre tem alguém pra discutir sério com você. E não só tem o r/brasil, caso enjoe, tem muita discussão boa internacional. Tenta esfriar um pouco a cabeça, dar uma pausa por um mês ou coisa assim, e tenta absorver essas besteiras mais na boa, você visivelmente é uma pessoa que curte um papo mais sério, prefere trocar ideias, eu acho que lidar com a falta de maturidade usando de apatia é o melhor remédio. 

E pode saber, a maioria é como você, só que num movimento parecido com o que ocorre em Fórum, as pessoas ficam mais caladas (que nem você faz) e dá espaço a esses que você critica, por serem mais vocais.

sketchyuserup,,,"&gt; I'm sure this is entirely dependent on policy and not at all connecting to the constant several decades long cash infusion from high salaries of those working in the oil industry.

That have surely helped the economy, but Norway was also doing fine before our oil era and there is more to a country than just the economy. Norway is doing well on pretty much all criterion and the population are mostly happy with the current trajectories, can the EU at large say the same? The fact that you see these constants demands for reform and have popular secession movements suggest to me that you can not. 

&gt;The problem with our policies is that our politicians half-assed them.

Perhaps, but do that change much? Perhaps you have the theoretical best policies, but people live there life in reality and meet the practical sides of your policies. 

&gt;Oh it doesn't really matter what we think. The EU will be fine entirely independent of what Norway does and Norway will be fine independet of what the EU does. But yes, I still think that accepting regulations you didn't have any input in creating to not be entirely on the rational side.

Depends on what you mean with fine. If you think the EU is fine now then I agree that it will be equally fine in the future too regardless of what Norway does. I'm very sceptical that it will ever become what I would describe as a well-functioning political union to say the least but time will show. 

There are certainly people who agree with you when it comes to our relationship with the EU and as said I do expect us to exit the agreement during the next decade. But most find our current situation to be preferable to joining the EU* and put even more of our politics under their jurisdiction.

redsox6,us,USA/Egypt,"JERUSALEM — Democracies around the world are searching for ways to protect their citizens from the threat of terrorism. As Israel’s public security minister, I hardly go a week without a foreign official turning to me to learn from our experience. For better or worse, the thousands of attacks carried out by Palestinian terrorists against Israel have made my country a world expert in combating this threat.

As a result of its counterterrorism operations, Israel now holds 6,177 terrorism-related prisoners. Many of these prisoners were involved in the wave of violence initiated in September 2000 under Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader at the time, following his rejection of an American-Israeli peace offer. The terrorist campaign that began then has so far led to the murder of some 1,300 Israelis — mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, children of every faith and background.

Of the 6,177 security prisoners, about 1,200 have recently begun a hunger strike. The strike leader is Marwan Barghouti, who was behind several deadly attacks.

Since his arrest in 2002, Mr. Barghouti has become adept at rebranding Palestinian terrorism as legitimate “resistance” and casting himself as a “moderate.” (Palestinian groups like to use language calibrated to make their actions more palatable to Westerners: Incarcerated terrorists are called “political prisoners,” and cold-blooded attacks against civilians in restaurants and buses are whitewashed as a “struggle for freedom.”) He would prefer that his Western audiences not know that he was convicted of ordering or approving three attacks that cost the lives of five people. These victims, Jewish, Christian and Druze, were simply going about their daily lives, sitting in a Tel Aviv restaurant, driving along a road, pulling into a gas station. Mr. Barghouti denies the charges but, saying he doesn’t recognize Israeli courts, declined to defend himself.

Mr. Barghouti would like his audience to believe that the hunger strike is a reaction to the mistreatment of prisoners like him. In fact, it has nothing to do with their conditions, which meet international standards. This is reflected in the list of demands presented by Mr. Barghouti to the Israel Prison Service: the option to obtain university degrees, more family visits, access to more television channels, public telephones and private doctors.

The true motivation behind this strike is political jockeying. From prison Mr. Barghouti has become a major player in Palestinian politics, releasing regular statements on Palestinian affairs and backing candidates in elections. He is now involved in the infighting over who will succeed Mahmoud Abbas, the aging president of the Palestinian Authority and leader of the Fatah party.

Mr. Barghouti seems to hope that being chosen to succeed Mr. Abbas will lead to his release from prison. But he faces competition from several rivals and recently failed to secure a senior position in a round of political appointments of Fatah leadership. The hunger strike is another step in his campaign to position himself as Mr. Abbas’s successor. The political nature of the strike is a main reason the leaders of Fatah’s rival, Hamas, have not backed the strike.

Fortunately, it appears that in capitals from London to Paris to Berlin to Washington there is less patience for attempts to rebrand and justify terrorism, and a greater awareness of the need to take a strong stance against violence and incitement. As I was told recently by the ambassador of a northern European country facing a growing terrorist threat, “Now we get you.”

Israel will not give in to extortion. The conditions and regulations in Israel’s prison system are determined according to Israeli law and international standards, not by pressure tactics. Surrendering to such a strike would constitute a surrender to terrorism and would only embolden terrorist groups, weaken our deterrence and lead to further conflict and bloodshed.

Instead, we are working with our partners and allies to address the factors that sustain and encourage terrorism. We believe that the international community must insist that the Palestinian Authority immediately cease its widespread incitement to violence. While some Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation exists, the Palestinian Authority plays a central role in fueling the epidemic of “lone wolf” attacks on Israelis.

The Palestinian Authority must also stop the most insidious form of encouragement to violence: payments to convicted terrorists and their families. The authority has enacted official legislation guaranteeing monthly stipends to every incarcerated terrorist and their families. The worse the attack and the longer the sentence, the higher the payout.

Because the Palestinian Authority’s budget depends heavily on foreign aid, these payments are, for all intents and purposes, paid by the taxpayers in the countries of foreign funders. While the Palestinians seem to have engaged in accounting tricks to blur the money trail — the money has now been funneled through the Palestine Liberation Organization — the billions of dollars in international aid enable the authority to continue lining the terrorists’ pockets with cash. Both politicians and ordinary citizens must demand an end to this gross abuse of international funds.

This is one of the most important lessons of the Israeli experience in fighting terrorism. While disrupting terrorist activity, we must also work together to combat the incitement that drives it. When Palestinian leaders cease to glorify terrorists and reward violence, security prisoners will become a thing of the past, and a viable peace will become the hope for the future.

&gt; I am skeptical that India ""will go all in with the West in time"" considering that India's answer to the CPEC is tied to Iran and by extension Russia and America's China and Russia policies makes me doubt America's ability to win over another proud independent power. Indians are much less willing to be as submissive as America's European allies and they need America less than Japan and RoK need America.

Now, these could be just conciliatory noises, but I think there are good reasons to believe they are sincere.

I think we'll just have to agree to disagree here. I think that India and China are on wholly different economic and geopolitical trajectories; if India wants to make a case for itself against China, it's going to need powerful partners. It simply does not have the resources to do so alone.

I feel that in this case a combination of geopolitical rationale and national jealousy will impel India to swallow its pride and go all in with the West. Even if it means behaving submissively.

2) Nope, no extra fee, but parking in the middle of the city is extremely expensive. So I'd suggest you'll leave your car at your sleeping place and use public transport, it's also faster. 

3) You can get to the arena by the S-Bahn, just drive until the station ""Stellingen"". From there is a bus shuttle to the arenas :)

4) Actually just give Google maps a look and try to get near one of the metro-stations (U1 or U3 is the best choice in my opinion) if you have one of those near your place you're in the center in 30 minutes max.

Just try to stay somewhere in between the yellow (U3) line circle. Then you're pretty close. But if you have U1 close to you it's fine too, just be sure to be somewhere between U Kellinghusenstraße and U Wandsbek Gartenstadt!

The whole state of North Dakotan might want A, but majority of NYC or any other major city wants B and that makes ND useless.  

Let's just look at New York itself.  The rural areas face different issues than the suburbia and City people.  However, the rural area doesn't matter in New York.  It's literally just 3 cities in NY that matter in that massive state.  Major cities all face about the same challenges.  And vote about the same.  

Imagine the US if no one gave a shit about your state because you don't have a major population or major city.  This is why the electoral college exists.  Gives a political voice for a majority in the different states.  

Also, if you're going to talk about other democratic nations in Europe, please just look at the EU.  

The presidents of the EU which much more closely resembles the US than a single country in Europe does, takes the Electoral college system and just expands the fuck out of it.  The president of parliament,  which is essentially what the POTUS is, is a member elected from the already elected members of the Union.  Imagine if the Senate just decided who the next president was going to be every 4 years and we had no input.  Exactly, it would fucking suck and be corrupt as fuck. 

The way the US votes on Presidents works for 50 states with wildly different opinions and a massive land mass.  To say ""buh look to the other countries"" is ridiculous.  Germany electing a president when the EU exists is essentially just electing a Governor.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr_Qp5k5zDY

The reason I think that a Socialistic society is possible and natural is because there are examples throughout history of it working. Google The Zapatistas, the Paris Commune, Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War. The opinion that no matter how bad the USSR was it was still not as bad as Eastern Europe today under Neoliberalism. The fact that co-ops often run more efficiently than other businesses and that in American history virtually all of the very few welfare programs came about by people uniting under a red flag. Socialism is the desire of the people. 

Which brings me to your point about me pointing out how I supposedly myself said fusing socialism with capitalism works. I didn't say that. My point is that the only reason Capitalism is tolerable AT ALL is because it has incorporated whatever it can incorporate from Socialist movements. In the neoliberal era these checks and balances have been gradually rolled back so that now we live in a time that is not so different from the late 19th and early 20th Century right before the Great Depression. If we simply look to create another welfare state without abolishing the system itself, the same thing will happen.

HoudinaSpice,,,"While you are correct that some of it had to do with just having a job during difficult times, it is well known in both anthropology and Native American studies departments that the intentional decimation of Native American food sources was carried out by the United States government. At this point in time the US government was trying their hardest to ""relocate"" Native tribes to smaller/less desirable areas. By decimating the bison populations the US government was attempting to force Native tribes (mostly plains tribes at this time) to give up their nomadic lifestyles (which required large areas of land that was desirable to European Americans) in favor of living on reservations. The idea being that if their main food source is gone they will HAVE to move to these reservations and take up farming/ranching. 

No one on this thread has suggested that Natives use ""every part of the animal"" however as an archaeology student I can tell you I have dug up an absurd amount of tools/ items made from all different kinds of animal parts so overall, yes indigenous cultures are far more likely to use many different parts of an animal than industrialized societies, however that is a null point here. 

In conclusion, the United States government has stated they did in fact pay people to take out bison populations in order to pressure plains tribes to ""settle"" in reservations. Buffalo Bill said on a buffalo hunting trip that was paid for by the United States government ""Kill every buffalo you can! Every buffalo dead is an Indian gone"". Please supply your evidence refuting the United States governments part in the decimation of bison populations. 

Last point- I identify as both white and Native American and your comment about white guilt is totally absurd. This information about the United States governments actions towards Native Americans in the past is not presented today to make white people feel bad, it is presented so that it is not forgotten. It is talked about and discussed today because the people who starved due to this policy DESERVE to be remembered. They deserve for people who live on the same land they lived on to know what they went through. We MUST know these things so they are not repeated. Your failure to accept that our government actively tried to kill native populations is not only disrespectful to me as a relative of the people who lived through that, it's also disrespectful to all the people who have fought for equality for Native people.

ereg,,,"It'd be disingenuous to place full blame and say ""[x] is the North's fault,"" and such argument's are usually a good sign you're talking with somebody who uses history to reaffirm existing political beliefs rather than a source for actual insight. In a lot of ways the South cannibalized itself during and after the war, but reintegration into the Union was not painless for secessionist states. 

The first thing that needs be recognized is just how much the war devastated the South. While the South didn't really have the infrastructure to sustain itself as a nation, General Sherman did everything in his power to cripple infrastructure where he could. Even with US subsidies, you don't have to guess who was left to front the lions share of rebuilding the nation. 

Across the northern electorate, there was a pressure to make the south pay for themselves as punishment for starting the war (and yes, the south did start it when they engaged in hot conflict on Ft. Sumter). It has been, and could be argued, that the Union used this aspect of reconstruction to extort the politics of the South, building further resentment among the common citizens, ie: ""It's bad enough that we lost the war, but now they're rubbing our faces in it."" Property tax was also huge during this time, and established land owners were bled dry. While I'll be the first to say it's bullshit to praise businesses as ""job creators"" because jobs are technically overhead, the fact is, a lot of established names/families found their empires unsustainable and a lot freed slaves found themselves with no farm to return to for paid labor, and it would be years before strong capital could return to the South.

On a political level, we can kind of think of reintegration as membership into the EU, where in, states had to show a certain level of economic stability, loyalty and value before they were fully reintegrated. Where this metaphor falls apart is, during this membership processes, federal troops occupied the land and regularly influenced state elections. 

This occupation, coupled with an influx of Republican (let's try to separate this from the political context of today) influence split political stability in the region. We often simplify this to ""the south was just sour about the war,"" and while that might have been true for some ""Dixiecrats,"" many citizens in the South that might have been grateful for a Union victory were still left to carry a fiscal burden; if you've ever wondered *how* some former slaves could be so damn loyal to the CSA, remember, the CSA left free slaves with more economic options and a lower tax burden. 

While many like to cite the US Civil War as the start of big government (and it's not a wholly inaccurate accusation, as the ""Union"" can be seen as the US's switch to nationhood from a confederacy of, well, united states with unique agendas) the states still had their rights to self govern. when Hays ended reconstruction in 1877, a lot of state we're given their freedom back before they were really ready for it, and immediately began competing economically with their neighbors. Some states embraced subsidies and new economies and have some strong economies today, some... are Alabama and Mississippi. 

When the cotton industry crashed (oh did it crash) many of states that would have boomed under it busted. Coupled with, what I will argue to be, the premature end to reconstruction, and some Southern states adopted a policy of ""leave us alone"" that we still see today. These states are consistently the poorest and most reluctant to accept help. The problems in Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas are far too complex for me to go into with the subject at hand, but I still feel they deserve special mention in how rooted it is in the Civil War and anti-northern sentiment (and Huey P. Long, but like I said, too complex for the subject of the Civil War).

Jaybird X3 at least easily lets you adjust the tonal balance to your liking.

However, I would not want EU citizens deported if they're here legitimately.

In the future, could expat Britons be paying taxes to HMRC much like Americans are taxed on worldwide income and pay it to the IRS?

However, could Brexit make it easier for U.S. and Canadian citizens to immigrate to the United Kingdom? Should we make it easier instead of having them come in on Tier 2 visas, and treat them the same way as workers from EU countries [allow employers to find workers from the United Kingdom, EU, U.S. and Canada]? That would require some negotiation with Donald Trump but it could be done. It would be loosening the immigration system a bit, but perhaps with immigration being a huge issue in Brexit anyway for people, this would be controversial.

For example, if I had an American fiancee/wife and enough evidence the relationship was legitimate, I probably wouldn't be able to bring her over here since I earn nowhere near the £18,600 mark [but there probably are some exemptions unless I'm wrong]?

Americans [and Canadians] have long been attracted to the United Kingdom - should we make it easier for them to immigrate here?

Also, Brexit could be good for the automobile industry - perhaps for exporting cars to the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Australia.

To you he is a PKK ""terrorist"" to the U.S. officials they are YPG and that's the end of that, if you really can't answer why he has become a terrorist, and why he's labelled PKK terrorist, then really it's just you picking and choosing who is a terrorist based on your agendas.. Nobody has to comply to your structures. Personally I view terrorism as acts of terror, not fighting a war.

Don't merge them all up and act as if this is strong evidence I am refuting or accusing you of fabricating, one suggests that people are funding the PKK and the YPG from Europe, great addition!

If it is only with Nickel, you may be in luck if you buy European jewellery. The [EU is very strict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_Directive) with Nickel used in Silver and Gold alloys and Sterling Silver or White gold will never contain nickel if it is targeted at the EU market.

ergzay,michigan text,Ex-Michigan - Silicon Valley transplant,"&gt; Is it considered 'weird' for Americans to live in close proximity to their families? (for example, I know many American sitcoms use this as a comedic trope)

Not at all weird. It's considered ""weird"" to live in your parents house much beyond the time you become an adult but many people will do this for a couple years before they have a steady job.

&gt; Assuming a normal family relationship, how often do you see your parents if you live more than 200 miles away?

I recently moved 2000 miles away from my parents. I've gone to see them only once since moving away about 7 months ago. I plan to set up a schedule of seeing them 2-3 times per year. 4th of July/summer, Christmas or Thanksgiving, and possibly some other spur of the moment trips.

&gt; Is moving from one state to another considered a big deal (like leaving your country of birth in Europe is) or is it considered very normal? Is it easy, bureaucracy-wise?

It's pretty normal. The only major differences between moving within a state vs moving outside a state is that you often have to re-register your car within some limit after moving (or face some minor fines when you have to do it later) and get a new vehicle operator's license some time after moving often at the same time as re-registering your vehicle. There's also just the process of learning things that are new, especially if you moved from a more lax state to a state with stricter laws.

&gt; How common is it for people to marry someone from another state?

I can only answer this from previous experience. My brother (from Michigan) married a girl who lived in Wisconsin but who was originally from Georgia. My parents both grew up in Michigan (though on opposite sides of the state) and met at University and married here and stayed here.

&gt; Does education play a big role in the distance someone lives away from their parents?

Yes quite a bit.

O Muv Luv Extra é um harém genérico que agrada a quem está acustumado com o gênero ou não é muito exigente. O Unlimited, que você só acessa após terminar o extra, acrescenta um mundo diferente e temas diferentes. É melhor que o anterior, mas ainda assim, não é grandes coisas... O Unlimited parece um monte de ideia boa mal aproveitada e ele é feito desse jeito propositalmente, os dois no fundo se tratam de um grande bait.

Agora não da pra analisar essa TRILOGIA olhando só para as duas primeiras partes da obra. A mais importante me parece que você não jogou (me corrija se eu estiver errado) que é o MUV-LUV Alternative. Para justificar o meu ponto, vou mostrar alguns números. O primeiro Muv-Luv (Extra + Unlimited) tem uma nota de 7,01 no VNDB, o que é uma nota BEM baixa para o padrão do VNDB. Já o Alternative, que é a continuação direta da trilogia, tem a nota de 9,22, o que a coloca como a série com a nota MAIS alta no VNDB, BEM ACIMA de clássicos como Fate/Night, Umineko, Steins Gate, Higurashi, Baldry Sky, White Album 2, Clannad, entre outros. O por que isso? Bom, não da pra explicar o que faz o Muv-Luv Alternative tão especial sem dar spoilers, mas adianto que ele faz o original ter sentido. Pequenos detalhes bobos do Extra e do Unlimited, que provavelmente passaram despercebidos, são trazidos a tona em uma narrativa épica, breathtaking e com um final incrível. Se você jogou o Alternative, peço que desconsidere o meu comentário. Se não jogou, peço que analise a trilogia como um todo, quando tiver o tempo para jogar o Alternative, pois ele é realmente gigante. Leio rápido e o tempo que levei pra terminar o Alternative foi maior que o tempo do Original com todas as suas rotas e o Unlimited. Ah, o Muv Luv Alternative AINDA nao foi lancado no Steam.

Hello,

Thank you for contacting the 23andMe Team. I looked into your inquiry and have determined that what you reported is most likely due to how our DNA comparison process works. When a parent's and child's results are compared, this process is called phasing.

Phasing increases the resolution of both sets of results, but a child's results increase in resolution more than their parent's results. For this reason, a child may have more detailed ancestry assignments than their parents. For example, a parent's DNA may be categorized as Broadly. This means that this piece of DNA was found within multiple reference populations. For example, a piece of DNA might be found with some frequency in among Italian, Balkan, and Iberian populations. Instead of choosing arbitrarily from among these regions, Ancestry Composition will label these pieces “Broadly Southern European.""

However, within a child's results, this piece of DNA is at a higher resolution and therefore will be assigned to a specific reference population. Although it is correct that a child inherits all of their DNA from their parents, it can seem inconsistent when you compare the child's results to their parent's results.

You can find more details about phasing and the Ancestry Composition feature in the Ancestry Composition Guide at: www.23andme.com/ancestry_composition_guide/

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.",True,0,1493678247,,False,0,dh06vfw,t3_68n487,t3_68n487,1496177799,7,False,23andme,t5_2scn9,

 **comment content**: Just so you are aware /u/koproller is giving you a deeply biased answer, he himself admits to being pro-EU and anti-Le Pen, and is also a leftist.

He is also lying. It is not ""unknown who the 100 or so people are who did this"". The protestors were anti-Le Pen, here is where the picture comes from:

Here is a much [better answer from the BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38321401):

She is in favor of:

**Restricting immigration**

&gt;The 2017 National Front manifesto renews its commitment to a massive reduction in legal immigration. Ms Le Pen argues French citizenship should be ""either inherited or merited"". As for illegal immigrants, they ""have no reason to stay in France, these people broke the law the minute they set foot on French soil"".

**Leaving the European Union**

&gt;If she wins the presidency in May, she has promised an EU referendum in France within six months of taking office. And the UK's vote to leave the EU in June 2016 has provided the template.

**Going strongly after Islamic terrorism**

&gt;Long before the Paris attacks on 13 November 2015, Marine Le Pen made a link between immigration and militant Islamism. In the immediate aftermath, she proposed to ""expel foreigners who preach hatred on our soil"" and to strip dual-nationality Muslims with extremist views of their French citizenship, a view traditionally associated with the far right.

**Instituting an nationalist economic policy**

&gt;Jobs, welfare, housing, schools, or any area of public provision should go to French nationals before they get to ""foreigners"".

The early years of MLS saw them cater strictly to soccer moms and sports fans as a whole, and the league almost went under in 2001 as a result. The biggest fan bases they have are in cities like Seattle and Portland where they treat the experience like they do in Europe. The league is looking for investment both from within the established US sports system and abroad. The recognition that this is a worldwide game is what saved the league in the first place, so I don't understand why they won't consider promotion and relegation.

As a result many labor protests organized on these holidays. Some of these Germanic protestors brought the tradition to the U.S. via immigration in the 19th century. 

On May 1st, 1886, a group of labor protestors gathered to strike in Chicago and demand an 8 hour work day. Several of them were beaten and killed by the police. In response to the deaths at the hands of the Chicago PD, a larger protest was organized on May 4th. 

At the protest, someone threw a bomb at the Chicago PD. This triggered a riot, and led to convictions and executions of some of the protest organizers. The bomber was never found, and the incident and the executions became a touchstone for the labor movement.

The most likely  outcome IMHO is that the UK gets strong-armed into an Association Agreement similar to the one Ukraine signed. This establishes a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), and allows the Ukraine to sell financial services to the EU, and provides for things like trade in Agriculture. It's arguably the closest thing to EU membership that doesn't require free movement of persons.

**Some miscellaneous interesting elements:**

* Article 1(f) says the Association Agreement is intended to *""establish conditions for increasingly close cooperation in other areas of mutual interest.""* 

* Article 7 says Ukraine shall *""promote gradual convergence in the area of foreign and security policy, including the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP)""*

* Article 71(a) lets the EU *""verify, in accordance with the guidelines of Annex X to this Agreement, all or part of the total control programme of the other Party's authorities or other measures where applicable.""*

* Annex X 4.3.2 says that *""on the spot checks may involve visits to production and manufacturing facilities, food-handling or storage areas and control laboratories to check on compliance""* based on risk assessment.

* Article 450 lets Ukraine participate in EU agencies as necessary to implement the agreement. Protocol III provides for broader participation so long as Ukraine pays in. 

* Article 475 asserts that *""Monitoring may include on-the-spot missions, with the participation of EU institutions, bodies and agencies, non- governmental bodies, supervisory authorities, independent experts and others as needed.""*

**Article 56 concerns ensuring that Ukrainian law approximates the EU *acquis*:**

* Paragraph 5:  *""Ukraine shall refrain from amending its horizontal and sectoral legislation listed in Annex III to this Agreement, except in order to align such legislation progressively with the corresponding EU acquis, and to maintain such alignment 
""*

* Paragraph 6: *""Ukraine shall notify the EU Party of any such changes in its national legislation""*

Parliamentary Sovereignty LOL.

**Some similar provisions as Article 56:**

* Article 256 requires Ukrainian competition law to come in line with that of the EU.

* Article 290 says *""As a way to achieve the objectives referred to in this Article, Ukraine shall approximate its laws, regulations and administrative practice to the EU acquis""*. 

* Article 133 requires Ukraine to approximate financial services laws as described on Annex VII. Whether or not changes have to be transposed is decided by a committee

Except government money was indispensable in the creation of Silicon Valley. Defence dollars kick-started the region. The moon shot created a market for integrated circuits. NASA funding also funded ARC, which invented the mouse and GUI and pioneered hypertext and networked collaboration. Military money created the Internet, the first web browser was funded by the NCSA, and the web was created at a European government agency.

Government has probably played a key role in the majority of crucial high tech innovations. Private sector innovation, in comparison, has been incremental, not revolutionary.

Government regulation has also played an important role in the past, such as the AT&amp;T antitrust ruling that gave us C and UNIX (both as technologies and as educational materials for a generation of computer scientists), or the patent-busting in WWI that made radio possible.

ThomasWankEngine,,Libertarian,"I agree that if we had an entirely libertarian society, it would be a disaster.  A religious oligarchy would probably more effective.  Still, libertarianism is interesting to consider in terms of individual policies.

Extending from your points:

* Welfare definitely reduces poverty, that is the ultimate aim of welfare.  However, to say that inequality is caused by the free market is simply not correct, at least in terms of the libertarian definition of free market.  From 1945 to 1975, there was massive inflation in the UK when unions and large employers adopted the 'full employment' scheme, which worked in terms of generating employees but not in terms or the larger economy.  After this came globalization of work and labour, helped by government regulations such as the EU and WTO, which not only supported corporate giants such as the banking unions, but these giants had an active say in what the regulations looked like.  This is not free market, this is corporatism.  Decades ago it used to be that if you worked at a cash register, you had a good solid job that you could support yourself with, especially if you had a working partner.  Now, for example, I have a family member who works in a shop as well as a cleaning job and still has to rely on welfare.  This is not the result of free market but of corporatism and the sad thing is that no amount of welfare can solve this problem.

* I agree with this.  I don't know many libertarians in the UK who are against spending on education, especially in the UK.  The problem for libertarians isn't on spending but on the regulations placed on schools.  If the government is going to spend on education, they first need to decide what is valid education and what isn't.  This led to the national curriculum, which in many ways does not help people find jobs and many students are not suited to this curriculum.  Libertarians tend to believe that the options of what a school can teach should be more open.  For example, if you wanted to open a school that teaches plumbing from 11+, as well as the basics of maths and English, you would be allowed to.  As plumbing prepares students for a career, the education has accomplished its purpose.  Students wouldn't have to go to this school, but they could if they wanted to.  Many libertarians favour the 'school voucher' system for this reason.

* I'm pretty sure no libertarian believes justice should be privatised.  In libertarian thinking, the only real purpose of government is to protect its citizens, which means government justice.  As well as this, libertarians are strongly against corruption in justice, which would mean making government a statutory offense, which at the moment it isn't.  This feeds corruption.

* Defence is crucially important, everyone agrees on that.  In many ways that is sad to think about, but is necessary for the times we live in.

* The poor not having access to medical treatment is a genuine concern of private healthcare, one that everyone should be aware of.  Just to give a brief example of what this might look like, you can use some predictive maths. Let's say that if I had a standard minimum wage salary of £13,500 per year, I would pay £1,038 of that as tax.  If I didn't have to pay that tax I would have an extra £1,038 to spend on healthcare.  The average cost of a private blood test is £75, X-ray is £99, consultant appointment is £150, MRI is £500.  These costs could soon add up, especially if that person is also on medication.  We would probably find that the more people who use a private health service, its prices would probably go down.  Removing tax also still allows for people to give money to healthcare charities.  Many libertarians support the idea that national insurance becomes mandatory health insurance for all people.

* The idea of privatising infrastructure has always been a weird one.  Even in countries where there is no income tax, the government still manages infrastructure.  The idea behind it is that if a business owns roads, it is in their interests to maintain the roads, otherwise they could lose out to nicer roads owned by competition.  It would be within the rights of the businesses to toll users of the roads but again most people would have more money from the reduced taxes.  The toll charges would also not likely be too high as there would be price competition between businesses.  I'm not sure how I feel about infrastructure.

""Hopefully we won't reach any deal with the EU"": a deal about what, Brexit? There needs to be a deal, because otherwise how would Brexit happen? That is the first deal. The second deal is about the future relationship between the UK and the EU about trade. Are you trying to say you want no trade between the UK and the EU? Do you know how bad that would be for everyone? Cars, medicine, machinery, capital, raw goods, services, software, media: you want to not allow those goods to traverse the EU-UK border? Why? For what purpose? I love watching the BBC, for example. And in my industry there is a UK company called Renishaw that delivers excellent machinery.

We are not ""on different sides of the fence"". I love the UK. I have friends there. I am going to visit London this year. Brexit sucks, but that doesn't mean the UK sucks - and especially not the people there. I don't agree with everything my government does, either. We are on the same side - the side of humanity. Unless you have some major investment that for systemic reasons are going to benefit financially from Brexit, you have little to no reason to favor this decision.

Stop treating politics and political entities like stick figures in your own personal power fantasy. Your views and opinions actually have an impact, especially if you express them in public. You are currently in favor of less cooperation, less trade, and less freedom.

The world is changing. The temporary advantage European nations have over other parts of the world is not going to last. As the US shifts towards Asia, and Asia is growing stronger, we need to unite in order to defend our interests and values in the world. If we divide ourselves, we will be too weak to do that. If you think there is some ""magic sauce"" that is going to keep the UK and continental Europe ahead of the curve, then you are sadly mistaken.

Even today, Europe is too weak to actively represents its interests in the world. We can only follow the US. Is that UK policy, to keep following the US for all foreign policy? The time when the UK has had the power to single handedly determine the course of action on the global stage is long gone. You have now decided that you would rather follow the US, which are all the way across the Atlantic, instead of continental Europe, which is just across the channel.

&gt; “The Jews have ceased to be a nation, for a nation without a territory is unthinkable,"" says one of the most prominent of Marxist theoreticians, Karl Kautsky 

The territory requirement for nationhood surprised me.  Didn't Stalin initially fund cultural specific arts in the 1950s?  And I thought Mao Zedong also prioritized recognizing and protecting various ethnic minorities within China.  These seem to be recognitions of collective identities (ethnicities or otherwise) that lacked territory.

On the other hand, I am also dimly aware of the position that the ethical imperative of communism supersedes all other constructed communities.  It makes sense.  Every imposed division of people is a tool to divide the poor and prevent them from rising up and overthrowing the ruling elite.  Therefore, all divisions must be destroyed.  I think.  Right?

In light of identity studies today, I have to admit I rather like this early recognition of the need to guarantee protections of minority groups within the state by Mao and Stalin.  It seems to recognize the reality of implicit biases that plague ostensibly unbiased institutions.  

If I'm not missing something here, I have to ask, why *did* Lenin deny the validity of a Jewish nation/identity?  It seems like his contemporaries were willing to protect minorities without sovereignty, so why not the Jews of Eastern Europe?

&gt; Another passenger, Margarita Vladimir, told CNN that the journey had been mostly peaceful but as passengers were visiting the toilet and preparing for landing, the turbulence erupted.

&gt; The flight operator cited this as the reason passengers were not warned to return to their seats before adding that around 750 cases of clear sky turbulence occurs globally each year.

NotoriousNastyBig--D,,,"&gt; Israel has an issue with African Jews.

No they dont. If your going to say something about sterilizing ethiopian jewish women, they didnt.

SOME ethiopian jewish women were given a birth control shot, depo provera, which meant they couldnt get pregnant for three months. Keep in mind, depo provera is the most popular birth control in east Africa, where Ethiopia is.

What likely happened is a mix of things. There was a language barrier between israeli doctors and the ethiopian jews. Ethiopians speak Geez, Israelis Hebrew. Some ethiopians thought they were getting a flu shot.

However, some jewish ethiopian women purposely got the shot, but lied about knowing they got it. Its because they didnt want to have more children, but faced pressure from their husbands to have more, as is usual in eastern africa, because more children helps substance farmers, which is how the ethiopian jews lived.

There was no systematic attempt to undermine birth rates, there could have been racist advisors or whatever, but it was not israeli policy, and anything done to ethiopian jewish women, only lasted 3 months. 

Id also remind you ethiopian jews are recent immigrants. It takes a while for them to integrate, especially since many live in poverty(due to them originated as substance farmers).

Russian Jews experienced very similar racism as the ethiopians did when they first came in the 90s, but since many Soviet Jews were university educated, and had a better time integrating, the racism against soviet jews subsided.

Its less to do with race, more of how integrated and how long the group has been there. 

&gt;But more like denial of jobs for Arabs or promoting Jews ahead of a more qualified Arab candidates the bias in Jewish police forces to not take Arab issues as serious as Jewish ones.

So you mean like normal racism in every country. That stuff happens in America too, and western europe.


&gt;The divisions between Ashkenazi and Sephardic can be somewhat strenuous too. 

30 years ago Id agree. But not really today. 1/4 Israelis are in mixed sephardic-ashkenazi marriages, and that number is only rising. There has been a pretty successful integration of the two groups. And generally, while there are some lingering issues, they are not as serious as you make it out to be.

Nuntius_Mortis,,,"&gt;You are so misguided it isn't even funny. This has nothing to do with logistics or technical challenge but is purely a political problem.
1) People aren't fleeing Syria they are fleeing the 'hellish' situation in Austria.. Or Turkey at most. These people are desperate for a good life.. Not fleeing from war. Those are the Mechanics in play.
2) You can easily stop this by ceasing benefits to illegals completely and detaining them wherever authorities come into contact with them. People do not flee Turkey just to end up in a decrepit camp in Germany. They flee to Germany because they've been promised free milk and honey. That's all there is to it. Why aren't these people fleeing to Qatar, Emirates and Saudi Arabia? Rich countries and culturally agreeable... Why not? Because these countries have made the political decision not to accept them. They don't have magic forcefields.

1) Turkey is not currently a safe country for a refugee.

2) The Syrian Civil War isn't the only conflict happening in the area. Take a look at this world map, for example -&gt; https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Ongoing_conflicts_around_the_world.svg

Brown refers to major wars (more than 10,000 deaths in the current or past year), red refers to wars (1,0000-9,999 deaths in the current or past year), orange refers to minor conflicts (100-999 deaths the current or past year) and yellow refers to skirmishes and clashes (less than 100 deaths the current or past year). As you can see in the map, the vast majority of Africa and Asia are embroiled in armed conflict. Europe (sans Russia and Ukraine), North America (sans Mexico), South America (sans Peru and Colombia) and Oceania are free from armed conflict. So, the people who flee from war zones will naturally gravitate to areas that aren't beset by war. It really wouldn't make sense to flee one war zone just to go to another.

&gt;As always... Enlightened individuals like yourself bestow these 'noble savagaes' with no agency. They can't be responsible for their own actions can they? So it was western colonialism I guess? Those few decades of French/English colonialism after defeating the imperial Ottoman power that had been there for centuries? They have no responsibility huh?
Even if this silly rationalization was correct it wouldn't change a thing. Historical guilt plays no role in geopolitics.

I'm not even talking about what happened back in the 18th and 19th Century. I'm talking about what happened in the 20th Century. To be more specific, I'm talking about the 1953 Iranian coup d'état against Mohammad Mosaddegh. Mosaddegh was the democratically-elected Prime Minister of Iran and he was secular. He was overthrown with the aid of the US and the UK intelligence because he tried to audit the documents of the AIOC (the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company which is now part of BP) and to limit their control over Iran's petroleum reserves. The company refused and the parliament voted to nationalize Iran's oil industry.

The thing is that when you plan coup d'états in a region you really cannot be sure of what is going to follow when the puppets you installed get overthrown. That's why you (as a government) should never back coup d'états of legitimally-elected governments.

... Are you living in an alternative reality? Pan-European economic growth is forecasted to be at about 1% per year - sluggish to say the least - if, and that's a big if, nothing goes wrong. German and Italian banks are in a great deal of trouble; should another naming crisis occur, and growth wiil quickly reverse in the Euro area. And then there are political risks involved; should Marine Le Pen, or the Five Star Movement, gain power the European Union will see a collapse of confidence that will signal its death knell. One of these catastrophes is likely to occur. 

On the other hand, the British economy is expected to grow by on average 1.5 per cent in the coming years, and we only have to deal with Brexit.

&gt; Blackfield is a collaboratorive music project led by Israeli rock singer Aviv Geffen. Together with the English musician Steven Wilson, they have released three albums under the moniker: Blackfield and Blackfield II as equal partners, and Welcome to my DNA with Geffen taking a more dominant role. With the release of  Blackfield IV in 2013, Wilson is taking an even more passive role, acting only as a contributor and mixer, and played his last live show with Blackfield in April 2014.

&gt; Current band members are drummer Tomer Z, bassist Seffy Efrati, and keyboardist Eran Mitelman. Former band members include Chris Maitland (replaced by Tomer Z, 2004) and Daniel Salomon (replaced by Eran Mitelman, 2007).

&gt; Collaborative era:
Formed after a meeting in 2000, the partnership blossomed into a cross-cultural collaboration called Blackfield.

&gt; Aviv had discovered Porcupine Tree in the mid ‘90s and followed their career development. In 2000 he invited the band to perform some concerts in Israel and met with Steven in London to discuss working together. Before long they had collaborated on the first Blackfield song. In 2001 the two met in a studio in Tel Aviv with the intention of recording a one-off EP.

&gt; The results of the session were so impressive however, that the EP was cancelled and the decision was made to continue writing and recording a full length album. Over the next 18 months the pair fitted in Blackfield writing and recording sessions whenever they could between their other commitments and finally in October 2003 the debut album was complete.

&gt; The collaborative songs alongside songs written by each separately brought a unique meeting of cultures, which resulted in the self titled album, which was hailed at the time as 'hypnotically effective' (Classic Rock) and ‘another strike of genius from Steven Wilson’ (Eclipsed).

&gt; Blackfield II arrived in February 2007. The pair’s return was greeted by an equally enthusiastic media response with Clash describing it as ‘a lush but soulful mix of separate cultures, deep sounds and touching lyrics,’ and CMU proclaiming it as ‘simply another complete triumph from the duo.’

&gt; Geffen-led era:
In January 2009, to promote his first English-language European release, Geffen went on a small tour of Europe with the Blackfield live band, including Wilson being billed as a special guest. Half of the set consisted of songs from the then yet to be released first English language solo album by Geffen while the rest was a selection of Blackfield songs. Wilson would also appear on three tracks from the album.

&gt; In April 2010, Geffen and Wilson got into studio to begin writing the follow-up to Blackfield II. However, this time, all songs, with the exception of the track ""Waving"", were written by Geffen, as Wilson had been concentrating on his second solo album, Grace for Drowning, at the same time. Wilson only performed lead vocals on five of the eleven tracks, but provide backing or co-vocals on several other tracks. Their third album, Welcome to my DNA, was released on the 28th of March 2011 and supported by a European and North American tour following a kickoff concert in Israel. However, several concert dates were cancelled due to the death of Wilson's father in May 2011.

&gt; After touring for Welcome to my DNA was completed, Wilson confirmed that with Blackfield, like the majority of his other projects, he himself had no particular plans for the future, but the project wasn't necessarily over either. However, in January 2012, Geffen has announced his intentions to release a fourth Blackfield album by May 2012. This prompted Wilson to announce that his role would continue to lessen, with Wilson acting only as a contributor and mixer. Wilson said of the band's future:

&gt; ""[…] just to clarify news elsewhere of a new Blackfield album coming this year – please note that this time my involvement will be as a contributor rather than a member. I will still be mixing the album, and maybe sing on a couple of Aviv’s songs (there will be other guest singers I understand), but with my complete blessing Blackfield is now under his sole curatorship, a process which really began with Welcome to My DNA.""

&gt; Wilson later admitted that it was his own idea for Geffen to take over the project, because Wilson wanted to concentrate on his solo career and Porcupine Tree in 2012 and 2013, while Geffen wanted to do another Blackfield album right away in 2012, and Wilson felt guilty about holding him back.

&gt; On January 29 and January 30, both Geffen and Wilson were in the studio working on vocals and guitar for the fourth album. Wilson stated that he will contribute lead vocals to only one song, but is also contributing ""a bunch of guitar parts"" and ""arranging backing vocals"". Despite his lessened role, he still said that he was ""protective of the Blackfield legacy"", and that the next album would ""still sound like a quintessential Blackfield album."" One of the guest vocalists that Wilson had alluded to before, was revealed to be Vincent Cavanagh of the band Anathema, who recorded vocals for a track.

&gt; On June 14, 2012, Geffen announced he was in the final mixing stages of the album with Wilson.

&gt; In a September 2012 interview with Discord Magazine, Wilson reiterated his stance with Blackfield, stating:

&gt; ""I won’t say producing [the fourth album], I am only helping [Geffen], a bit of singing, guitar, mixing whatever it takes but I am not going to tour, it’ll be too much, I’ll kill myself, would just run myself to the ground. I won’t tour Blackfield anymore but I will do anything to keep the name going…I just don’t think that writing the kind of style that Blackfield make is where I am at right now.""

&gt; At the end of November 2012, Geffen stated that he roughly aims for an April 2013 release time frame. Wilson confirmed that he sang and played guitar on several tracks, but ""much less than before"", that Geffen was able to get ""a bunch of great singers to contribute to the record, some of whom are quite well known"", and that the album would be the first that Geffen would consent to be mixed for surround sound.

&gt; On February 25, 2013, Wilson released his third solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing (And Other Stories), of which some copies contained a compilation sampler disc of music done by artists under record label Kscope; one track was a new track, ""Pills"", taken from the fourth Blackfield album.

&gt; On June 9, 2013, it was announced that the fourth album would officially be titled Blackfield IV, and its release date would be August 26, 2013. Read more on Last.fm.

2. ""He never figured out how to push an agenda through congress by working with senators across the aisle"". As far as I heard (both before I got into politics and in the background on the news, republicans played obstructionalism the entire time. Obama originally made a bunch of concessions to the republicans to try and get Obamacare through and still not one republican voted for it (of course, this is how I understand it, feel free to correct me). For the judge nominee specifically, here is a quote from a Republican at the time taken from Wikipedia: *On March 11, 2016, Senator Orrin Hatch, president pro tempore of the United States Senate and the most senior Republican Senator, predicted that President Obama would ""name someone the liberal Democratic base wants"" even though he ""could easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man.""Five days later, on March 16, Obama formally nominated Garland for Supreme Court Justice.*
That is immediately followed by : *In an unprecedented move, Senate Republicans (under Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell) refused to consider Garland's nomination, holding ""no hearings, no votes, no action whatsoever"" on the nomination*. They didn't. Even. Consider him. In my eyes, that's a congress that's not workable, so I don't have any blame for Obama.

3. https://ig.ft.com/sites/numbers/economies/us . Maybe I don't know how to read a graph, but that looks like growth. Even with the analysis of growth on the side, I think I'll gladly take steady recovery. Also, if we're talking stock market growth, it doesn't surprise me that a man promising deregulation and tax cuts is spurring investment and growth, the thing is, those regulations are made for a reason, notably the ones made for the environment, and trump's tax plan is forecasted to balloon debt with no back up income to support the cut. Economics, again, out of my element, but with what Trumps doing? It doesn't sound good to me. At all. And you say Obamacare was disastrous, I haven't seen any disasters, especially since the republicans are struggling to find a worthy replacement after having years.

4. ""All our oil comes from Saudi Arabia"". This is factual wrong and/or greatly exaggerated. According to Forbes Canada supplies the largest portion of our crude oil imports. And, again, I'm not saying the rest of the Middle East is any better, however, I wouldn't call them a cornerstone of social equality either. This opinion is a bit biased by the hate for them on the world news subreddit.

5. World war 2 ruined Europe. I don't think a few terrorist attacks can compare. On top of that, Europe NEEDS immigration. Yes, literally needs. All of them are below sustainable population growth so if they don't get immigrants, they're going to have the dire situation of a declining population. I'd argue something similar for America, but not nearly as dire at the moment.

6. ""Continue to commit genocide"". Genocide? Our attack was in response to a chemical attack on an area under control of Assad's enemies. I don't recall a single part of Trumps retaliation being based on the genocide of........I don't even know who in Syria. He saw the kids poisoned by gas and that's what his comments were on.

7. And lastly, I simply cannot agree with your viewpoint. His immigration policy has been deemed unconstitutional not once, but twice, his healthcare repeal attempt was laughable as it would've harmed even more. He accused a former president of a crime without evidence not to mention many other bumbles and falsehoods that make him look outright incompetent and hurt our standing with our allies. He hasn't appointed a majority of the positions he's supposed to. His current tax cut, again, looks God awful. And he's trashed a lot of regulations regarding environmental protections that the environment very much needs.

Companies are not real physical objects. You can't do anything with them.

 **comment content**: France, I've said, it's a history, it's a geography, but it's also an ensemble of values and of principles transmitted from generation to generation like passwords: it's a certain idea of the world and for the world: it's a way of Man to see it and to know it: it's finally a singular voice addressed to all the people of the universe.

Singular, why? Simply because the word France wakes the ear of many men, across the continents, some kind of particular music. In Latin America, in Africa, in Asia, in Central Europe, around the Mediterranean, it evokes something other than a country situated in the European [cap?].

If one learns our language, at sometimes a huge price, in Argentina or Poland,  if there are waiting lists to sign up for the Alliance française of Shanghai, of Mexico, or at the French Rabot school in Rome, if Paris is the biggest touristic destination worldwide, it's because Frane is something else and more than an industrial, agricultural, or military power.

primeiro, isso não explica pq razão os EUA tentaram boicotar todos os países que escolheram ser socialistas. segundo, o capitalismo nasce da mesma forma: se és contra a revolução armada, tens de rejeitar o capitalismo, pq surgiu assim.

&gt; Quanto aos ""esforços"" dos EUA. Compreendes que a URSS financiou N revoluções pelo mundo inteiro antes de qualquer intervenção pelos EUA? 

falso, vê [isto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change). os EUA minam todos os esforços anti-capitalistas antes, durante e após a existência da URSS. por exemplo, vê o caso do Chile, onde os EUA ajudaram a depor um presidente eleito democraticamente.

&gt; (comunismo é inerentemente expansionista - outro dos motivos para a sua auto destruição) 

tens alguma fonte para justificar este argumento? o comunismo é internacionalista, algo mt diferente do globalismo, imperialismo ou colonialismo capitalistas.

tipo, achas mesmo que a globalização neoliberal é um produto comunista?

&gt; Revoluções estas das quais ainda sentimos repercussões, revoluções que fizeram (como a natureza de qualquer revolução armada) bastante mortos nos processos (algo que o Marx também sempre defendeu para o ""bem maior"").

sabias que Marx inspirou-se nas revoluções burguesas para imaginar como seria a revolução comunista? ou seja, o capitalismo nasceu exatamente da mesma forma, com sangue e guerra civil. isso porventura faz-te rejeitar o capitalismo?

&gt; Provavelmente, as pessoas n querem ver novos regimes comunistas a aparecer e portanto ""talvez"" haja (como há para qualquer outro movimento politico/social não conformista) forças e influencias monetárias e políticas contra ela.

tese circular: as 'pessoas' não querem comunismo pq existe uma reação capitalista, e existe uma reação capitalista pq as 'pessoas' não querem o comunismo.

e pareces aquele esclavagista que, após reprimir a rebelião dos escravos à força, diz que é impossível acabar com a escravatura, pq querer a liberdade vai contra a natureza humana, e que é inevitável haver reações porque as pessoas querem manter a escravatura... se não quisessem já não havia escravatura.

 Also we do say sorry. Americans say sarry for the most part I think.

**1. UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE AND MATERNITY/PATERNITY LEAVE**
How do American families do it?? No need to worry about insurance. There is something about just knowing that you are going to have care if you need AND! that you wont have to pay for it if you do. Legislated Maternity leave is a big boost to mental health also. As of now it is your right to take 18 months at 33 percent income or 12 at 55 percent income. Still up to the standards of Europe but better than nothing.

**2. THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM**
I completely reject the idea that there are only two types of people politically speaking. However we only have 3 main political parties. In most European countries they at least 4. We unfortunately still have first past the post rather than proportional representation or a preferential ballot. 

**3. REASONABLE(ISH) TUITION RATES** University tuition is about $6,100 on average, and we’re eternally grateful. Should be $0.00 in my view.

**4. REGULATED BANKS** Between the recession, sequester and fiscal cliff, the US economic system always seems to be on the brink of disaster. Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum’s annual Global Competitiveness Report recently deemed Canadian banks the world’s most sound for the eighth year in a row. (The US came in 39th.)

**5. ACTUAL GUN CONTROL** (although still pretty liberal like the U.S.) Its more our lack of a gun culture than actual gun control. However We do not have a constitutional right to bear arms but where I live (Saskatchewan rural) most people have riffles. 

**6. LEGISLATED VACATION PAY** Most places in the Country you get two weeks guaranteed vacation which you get paid for. Where I live we get 3.

Dr_Mrs_Pibb,,,"1)    Is it considered 'weird' for Americans to live in close proximity to their families? (for example, I know many American sitcoms use this as a comedic trope)

Yes, well, a little. I think right now it's pretty common for young people to move back in with their parents, but it isn't the norm to live in the same neighborhood as your parents. 

2) Assuming a normal family relationship, how often do you see your parents if you live more than 200 miles away?

My husband used to live around 200 miles away from his family. My family lived within the same state, just under 100 miles away. We typically would alternate which family we visited on major holidays (Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, Memorial Day). We were more likely to visit my family on three day weekends because they were closer.  

3) Is moving from one state to another considered a big deal (like leaving your country of birth in Europe is) or is it considered very normal? Is it easy, bureaucracy-wise?

My husband moved from Pennsylvania to Maryland. Not a big deal. While some laws and taxes are slightly different, most states in the same region have similar laws and customs. It might be a bigger cultural difference if we moved to, say, Texas? Or California? Different regions. 

4) How common is it for people to marry someone from another state?

We did! Pretty common, I would say. A lot of people leave their home state when they go to college. Some states just aren't hiring in certain fields. People go where the jobs are. And then they meet their spouses. :) 

5) Does education play a big role in the distance someone lives away from their parents?

I think it's more about opportunity. Sometimes jobs in your field/industry aren't readily available in your hometown. My hometown is very expensive, and for a young professional like myself, I couldn't afford to live there (in the lifestyle I've become accustomed to, at least). Also, I think (many...obviously there are exceptions) Americans prefer to be independent from their parents. There's a stigma to living with your parents, and living *near* them is not a motivating factor for me when I look for jobs or housing. I do like to be within 2-3 hours away from my family, but I wouldn't intentionally move closer to them just to be closer. I would follow a job opportunity or amazing housing opportunity and it would be a coincidence.

Kraz_I,,,"I specifically said ""Trump Administration"", not Trump himself. Trump may have no ideology other than the promotion of the Trump brand, but Steve Bannon and his other advisers certainly have a far right agenda. 

As far as fascism goes, it's pretty much the most ill-defined word in the English language. The original fascists like Mussolini used very general, wishy washy feeling-based language to describe their ideology (mostly things that apply to any nationalist ideology), and modern definitions were mostly created by anti-fascists. It's pretty much a meaningless word outside of its historical context. It's better to stick to better defined political words like ""Nationalist"", ""corporatist"", and ""protectionist"". 

As far as how the French National front is further to the left in, (I wouldn't call them far left in any regard whatsoever), it's mostly standard European political stuff, things that they can't possibly compromise on without losing votes. Things like abortion rights, reducing restrictions on internet use, and a 46% tax bracket for the wealthy.

 **comment content**: Matter of Perspective really. You could easily argue Baghdad, Varanasi, Beijing, Cairo ect or even cities that no longer exist like Karakorum, the Capital of the Mongol Empire. All of which like Rome and Paris have had ups and downs.

New York is a legitimate answer as well in many regard. What it lacks in lineage it gains in modern city planning and the simple fact that it has emerged as the ""worlds city"" in a time of unprecedented global politics. Being the Defacto capital of the world through the UN,and its power has a permanent chair member of the US federal Reserve means it has more power then even Rome or Paris in its hayday ,more then 800 languages are spoken daily there and it is the city which has the largest foreign born population in the world and largest number of foreign born students in the world. No one of course is going to argue its economic and cultural contributions but more then that it is this worlds Global city and that simply cannot be ignored.

&gt;Foreign child labour in horrid conditions

Yup, lots of people work in worse conditions that we do, over in the 3rd world (I'm presuming you're posting from a non 3rd-world country, correct me if I'm wrong!). No AC, no coffee machine, lower wages, no insurance. But the 'sweatshops' provided by Western firms (let's be honest, we're talking about the West here) can provide a better pay rate and better work conditions than local competitors. So on the whole, the net result for the workers is positive.

&gt;top prices

The 'top prices' are only sustainable if customers are willing to pay them. If a company like Supreme or Superdry charges too much, people will stop buying their goods and the firm's profits will drop, possibly drying them out of business. You can tell that, say, American and European consumers are well off because when we don't want to pay these top prices we can go to other, cheaper manufacturers for our goods (e/g/ Fruit of the Loom or Gildan)

&gt;plastic bottles in the environment

This is, I think, you most legit point. Self-interest is what drives the providers of goods and services to offer the best good or service they can at the lowest price to the consumer. However, self-interest doesn't stop people from polluting. I think the state does have a responsibility in this instance to incentivise clean production and consumption.

&gt;throw away computers

Planned obsoletion is weird and frustrating, but if it doesn't work, then why do we keep buying the goods? If it cost us less and meant a better product, people would go out of their way to buy products that last for longer, and manufacturers of goods with artificially-short lifetimes would go out of business. Besides, if we update our operating systems every couple of years, then all the economic transactions that rely on those operating systems will be conducted more smoothly.

This is new territory and I haven't read enough on the matter. I've just highlighted it to show that I've read your point, but I'd be bullshitting if I offered any kind of opinion on it.

What happens to ""honest developers"" when they are in fashion and can afford an army of lawyers? Even Google and Microsoft were small developers once. But yeah, I too think patents are harmful.

At least he's self-aware of his poor performance and worked on fixing his problems, which is something I don't think the coaching staff were able to help him with. 

The main issue right now is the **unavailability of import players for mid lane**. LCK region is super competitive, and Korean/Chinese pros are pretty much not for sale/competing with chinese money given that LPL is heading for franchising.  EU mids?

I'm not even going to talk about the challenger mid laners because we know from multiple series that the top CS teams are under other team's franchises already.

I'd put my money on trust at least RO/Lourlo to play at a higher condition than in Spring. They're good, safe bets now, probably more so after the midseason update. Bring Piglet back on ADC at least for a split since the meta benefits him (but he should still develop his utility/low resource champs), and we could definitely take on a promising ADC rookie who has a good pool, groom him up, sub him some games with weak ADC laners to give him a taste of the pro league. If the split doesn't work out, we can import a mid when the season is over and players are much more available for trading and signing - right now it's a hoarder's mentality with franchising on the horizon.

&gt; 

Butter,  high quality parmesan,  garlic,  water from cooking the pasta, fresh ground nutmeg. Nothing else! 

[This is how I learned to make Alfredo from my Nonna].

Cook your pasta in less water than usual (I use a high sided skillet), which is necessary to get really starchy pasta  water. I usually pull the pasta out a bit before it's al dente, and put it aside. Keep the pasta water in a bowl - DO NOT DUMP IT DOWN THE DRAIN! 

To the skillet add a chunk of good butter (the european/fermented kind) ~1/4 cup for 1/2-3/4 pound of pasta.  Melt the butter, add the garlic and sauté until fragrant. Plop the pasta into the pan and toss to coat.  

Sprinkle on finely grated, high quality parmesan (no green cans here!). Make sure your parm doesn't have any anti-caking agents in it,  or it'll taste like paste.  I like 4-6 oz of parm for the above pasta amount.  

Slowly add pasta water while gently tossing pasta/cheese/butter/garlic until cheese is melted and everything is saucy. If you get to much water, add more cheese to thicken it back up. If it's not ""rich"" enough,  add more butter. 

To really kick it up a notch,  grate some nutmeg on to the pasta right before serving. 

There are alfredo recipes that call for a ton of cream,  but after growing up eating this they are so heavy and glue-y that I can't stomach them.  This version is light enough to not want to die after you eat too much (and you will), but still creamy,  salty, rich, and delicious in the way that only good alfredo can be.

TornLabrum,,,"&gt;Making carrying weapons illegal does nothing to stop criminals, rioters and domestic terrorists from obtaining them.

Source? This is something quantifiable. There aren't illegal guns in circulation here. I'm actually trying to think, all the terrorist attacks in living memory used either bombs on buses/trains or insane people hacking at someone with a machete. I can't actually recall a single attack that used guns.

I mean, your reasoning is just straight retarded. Look at Germany, in 2015 police shot 7 people. USA police killed 100 times more people than that. Germany has 0.07 gun related homicides per 100,000, the US has 3.43 per 100,000. In the USA people die across the board from gun violence. It's been proven in Australia, you can take guns out of the system, track illegal guns and prevent them from circulating. Then no one can get guns, no one needs to get shot. And if someone does have an illegal firearm, they are tracked and their house gets raided, it's a huge deal to own an illegal gun here. 

Like, why are illegal firearms even allowed to circulate in the US, if it's such a big problem, why are you not dealing with it? That shit is so easy to track and crack down on, case in point: Europe and the Anglosphere. Where illegal guns are a problem magnitudes smaller than in the US.

A gun is just an extremely efficient way to kill people. Having swathes of untrained civilians with access to them, allowing illegal guns to circulate and having badly trained retard police officers with guns is a recipe for disaster. As the above statistics show.

In Europe being a Police officer is a very attractive job, you get a lot of respect from the community and it attracts quality candidates. In the US, they won't hire you if you're too intelligent, because you might question immoral orders and such. LOL. Shows their priorities.

I've been to many places in Europe. I've NEVER been afraid to get shot, even when I saw a policeman with a submachine gun in London.

On '80 Days', each episode discusses an obscure location that you probably don't know much about. In this episode we dive into the unique islands of the Seychelles, a country made up of an archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean. This episode features a discussion of the scariest crabs you're ever likely to encounter, one of the world's largest of strangest looking nuts, a extremely dumb coup attempt and the smallest capital city in the world. Come and join us as we explore the Seychelles!

Tara_Dikov,,,"Probably not the biggest but, certainly one of the biggest mistakes: teaching the American troops guerrilla warfare during the Spanish-American war. Now that they know how you fight, don't wonder how you were easily during the Philippine-American war.

Also it just boils down to this: Trusting the Americans was a huge mistake. This country just became a dispensable pawn for its ambitions. 

Some here says things about how we shouldn't have asked for independence. Nope, they're still gonna give it out without us asking. They don't want to pay lots to rebuild things here after they played with bombs and artillery throughout our landscape. 

The US was never benevolent to us. Anyone who puts them in a good light, history-wise, makes me palm my face really hard. Even Mark Twain himself hated what the US did to us. Put down the rose-tinted glasses and actually google ""American Propaganda/Concentration Camps in the Philippine-American war""

""The funniest thing was when at the close of the Spanish-American War the United States paid poor decrepit old Spain $20,000,000 for the Philippines. It was just a case of this country buying its way into good society. Honestly, when I read in the papers that this deal had been made, I laughed until my sides ached. There were the Filipinos fighting like blazes for their liberty. Spain would not hear to it. The United States stepped in, and after they had licked the enemy to a standstill, instead of freeing the Filipinos they paid that enormous amount for an island which is of no earthly account to us; just wanted to be like the aristocratic countries of Europe which have possessions in foreign waters. The United States wanted to be in the swim, and it, too, had to branch out, like an American heiress buying a Duke or an Earl. Sounds well, but that's all.""

Ocean heat sink has always made the most sense to me and growing up in Chicago seeing lake-effect and air temp changes within 25 miles of Lake Michigan I am probably bias to this explanation. But this leads into my original comment, because of the North Atlantic Current, this warmer water that is constantly being replenished, leading to average water temps higher than what would otherwise be found at this latitude. Example London is further north than Juneau, AK but much warmer.

While atmospheric flow I'm sure has an impact, I feel (purely observational) that this would lead to a more erratic climate due to changes in the jet stream, whereas the Northern European continent seems to have a more stable climate until you get further into the north sea / eastern Scandinavia which is less effected by Atlantic currents.

this is about 2300 AUD. If we take Sydney/Melbourne rates, it's more than enough for a single person to live. Rent is typically between 120-160 per week (600 p/m), food is about 15-20 a day (kalo mau mewah dan makan diluar/kantin 1x sehari= 800), general expenses buat internet pulsa etc katakan 200-300, so bahkan tanpa kerja sambilan pun you bisa pull around 5 juta sebulan bersih, kali 24 bulan (for a masters, 48 bulan for phd). Duit kerja sambilannya itu yang menggiurkan (especially in EU/AUS, not so much in Japan, I think). For a student in AU, you are legally allowed to work 20 hours per week, with minimum wage around 15 p/h. So potentially you can net minimum 3jt per minggu tambahan. Kalo mau kerja bawah tangan (i.e cash in hand), terserah mau kerja berapa banyak sekuatnya.

schuey13,,,"The Missouri Compromise and the Kansas-Nebraska act are key examples of legislative compromise that was attempted to stop the outbreak of war. 

The Missouri Compromise appealed to the North's wishes of not adding any more slave states to the Union above the 36""30' parallel of the Louisiana Territory. It also appealed to the North by adding another free state in Maine. It attempted to make an appeal to the South by admitting Missouri with the legal option to become a slave state. It would also allow for states under the drawn line to become slave states. However, many Southerners argued that the addition of free states would contribute further to the growing majority the North had over the South, thus rendering their rights as states useless.

The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 retracted on many of the North-favored parts of the Missouri Compromise by allowing states like Kansas and Nebraska to be admitted to the Union and have the decision of being a slave state left up to popular sovereignty, a fundamental push for states rights. This however, led to many proponents of slavery in Missouri to go into Kansas and vote for it to become a slave state. This led to Bleeding Kansas, which would prove to be a preview of the future war.

While this isn't the complete answer you may be looking for, these are examples of the attempt made at compromise as the debate in the mid-19th Century became more and more volatile. It is important to note that Lincoln and the North did not just let the South secede and then enter into war. These two legislative acts were attempts to reach a compromise where the divisions between North and South, free and slave, could live together. However, the debates from both Abolitionists and Southerners proved to be too destructive for these compromises to work. Southern proponents of slavery could not see the Union surviving if slaver were abolished, and Northern Abolitionists could not see the Union surviving if slavery was allowed to continue.

The Civil War was a product of many things, which is why the question posed by Mr. Trump seems so strange. The causes were numerous, and many Founders predicted that the issue of slavery would be the most contested in the young country's future. There were some attempts at compromise, but the country kept growing farther and farther apart. Violence could have perhaps been avoided, but the Southern loyalty to tradition and states rights, and the North's growing insistence of abolition led to the Union's dissolving. Lincoln and the North saw it as unlawful and continued to operate as if the South was still part of the Union. This forced the Confederacy to defend their newly found nation, leading to war.

Here is Lincoln on the legality of secession from his First Inaugural in 1861:

&gt;I hold that, in contemplation of universal law, and of the Constitution, the union of these States is perpetual....It follows....that no State, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence, within any State or States, against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances. I, therefore, consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, the Union is unbroken.

By not seeing the secession of the Confederacy as lawful, Lincoln asserted that the federal government of the Union still held power over the Southern states. This led to the Confederacy to being seen as an illegitimate revolution against the United States, much like how Great Britain saw the Colonies claim to independence. When Lincoln and the Union did not willingly let the South secede, it forced the South's hand to attack the force it saw as an oppressor, leading to the Battle of Fort Sumner and the start of the Civil War. 

As far as foreign countries go, they did little to stop the war. The Union, after secession, blockaded the South in an attempt to bring it back into the Union. The Union also wished for the Confederacy not to be recognized by other states, in an attempt to block independent trade to be conducted by the Confederacy. However, Britain and France did grant some recognition of the Confederacy's wish to become and independent state. Here's a bit from the State Department's website that explains:

&gt;When the Union did declare a blockade upon the rebel states in April 1861, however, it did not prompt the response expected from the Europeans. The blockade’s legal and political implications took on greater significance than its economic effects because it undermined Lincoln’s insistence that the war was merely an internal insurrection. A blockade was a weapon of war between sovereign states. In May, Britain responded to the blockade with a proclamation of neutrality, which the other European powers followed. This tacitly granted the Confederacy belligerent status, the right to contract loans and purchase supplies in neutral nations and to exercise belligerent rights on the high seas. 

The response of the European countries to remain neutral and grant belligerent status led the Confederacy to feel even more strongly that the actions the Union had taken after secession were unjust and warranted conflict. The Union, in its effort to remain in control of the Southern states forced the hand of the Confederacy.

Frommerman,,,"We never have to pay it back.

People and governments are very different in one important way, here: people get old and die. People expect to be able to retire at some point and live off zero income, with just savings, and as a result they must pay off their debts. Governments do not have that problem. They can continue to exist for a very long time, and if they ever stop existing...the debt isn't their problem any more. Therefore, a government never has to pay off its debts entirely. They expect to exist forever.

You might say that Greece didn't pay its debts and now look at it, but that was a very different issue. They took on debts their country absolutely could not even pay the interest on, much less the prinicple. In addition, they cooked their own books to get into the EU, *and* it was common practice for people to just not pay their taxes. None of those are problems in the US. Our interest payments are increasing far more slowly than our economy (and therefore tax base) is growing, and as a result we can safely continue to pay the interest effectively in perpetuity. We even wind up ahead on the deal, because those loans allow us to invest in our own economy and drive it forward even faster, pushing us further ahead of interest.

You might say that China or whoever could call back the debts and then we're fucked, but that's not how any of this works either. First off, treasury bonds are a contract: give us X money now, we give you X plus interest in ten years. You cannot alter the terms of this contract, you can't call back the debt faster than it is due. You can sell the bond to someone else, and indeed there is a massive market which does just this, but the US government pays nothing for the secondary market.

In addition to all of this, US treasury bonds are a vital part of the world's economy. They provide a place for companies and other entities to park their wealth between deals, in a way which is not subject to inflation. The purchasing power of that T note will remain the same as the cash you put into buying it, so it is better than money in a bank. And the reason this system works at all is because everyone knows the US has never once failed to pay up on a T note in over 200 years. You can't buy that kind of trust.

So. People are willing to hand us money for practically free, at no risk to us. The interest is effectively irrelevant. Why should we *not* accept that offer?",True,0,1493703434,,False,0,dh0pgb1,t3_68r1po,t1_dh0ou0y,1496186763,3,False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,

choopie,,8∆,"I think the difference between cultural appropriation and cultural exchange is similar to the difference between, say, interracial dating vs fetishizing someone's race. One is normal and on a level playing field, the other either involves unequal power dynamics, or is steeped in racist and stereotypical views, or is just ignorant/disrespectful of the other culture.

I mean, I think there are some people (mostly white people tbh) who become very separatist and think all exchange is appropriative. Go ahead and drink your tequila or celebrate Chinese New Years or try the latest Japanese makeup trend or whatever. But it does help to have knowledge about the thing it is you're doing. I think Americans and Europeans in particular maybe find it hard to understand which things sting and which don't, because for centuries they've been colonizing and demanding assimilation from other cultures, believing that if a foreign person wears western clothes and celebrates Christian holidays and eats European food then that makes them more respectable. So there's a pretty miniscule number of things that foreigners could do that would offend the west, which then makes the concept of appropriation seem alien and incomprehensible.

The rock n roll thing--it's not like the anger is directed at a specific musician or anything. But it's more of a frustration at the system that creates it, where a part of black culture only becomes acceptable once white people do it. It's like if you did a project for school and got an F, and then another kid copied your project and got an A. It would feel kinda shitty, right? You'd want that A. Except in the case of appropriation there isn't a single entity (the teacher) that you can go and get it from, it's the culmination of a bunch of factors--historical context, the racism embedded in the whole culture, time has already passed and you can't make a person un-famous or un-inspired by your thing.",True,0,1493703921,,False,0,dh0pof3,t3_68qav4,t3_68qav4,1496186873,3,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,
sumosacerdote,,,"Bem, não falo da questão espiritual, mas sim da moral religiosa. Não que ela seja perfeita e bla bla bla, mas serviu como espécie de trilho pra sociedade ao longo do tempo. No caso da moral cristã, que está mais próxima da gente, temos alguns valores bem fortes, como a família. A família, não é só um arranjo necessário socialmente, mas também economicamente. Uma família estruturada pode acumular mais capital e ter mais estabilidade. Isso é importantíssimo para os que a compõe, como para a sociedade. Isso permite que seus filhos sejam mais ricos que seus pais e assim por diante. Foi basicamente o que fez os Estados Unidos um país rico, principalmente nos Estados mais ao interior. 

E da religião também origina-se a ideia de um casamento duradouro. Isso também faz falta. A gente vê, hoje, é cada vez mais comum pessoas se casando cedo, coisa de 18 anos, sem ter nenhuma noção do que tá fazendo. Lógico que a moral religiosa tá longe de ser perfeita, mas ela deveria servir para impedir isso. O casamento e a prole são coisas muito sérias, mas é muito comum, principalmente nas periferias e zonas rurais, garotas se casando com homens alcoólatras, drogados, envolvidos com tráfico ou que simplesmente ainda não possuem nenhuma condição financeira. Isso aí é a receita pro desastre. Os filhos vão crescer num ambiente péssimo, vão ter um péssimo histórico escolar e, sem oportunidades, vão entrar pro crime ou passar o resto da vida sobrevivendo em empregos ruins. 

Outra coisa que eu acho que causa mais mal que bem, é a vida moderna onde o homem e a mulher trabalham intensamente e deixam os filhos com uma babá. Não que eu seja contra mulheres trabalharem, veja bem. Pelo contrário, acredito muito em negócios familiares e num casal que construa a riqueza junto. Mas essa obsessão moderna por trabalho, até da parte dos homens, é nociva. O casal tem que ser ativo na criação dos filhos, pelo menos nos primeiros anos. É perfeitamente possível os dois diminuírem a carga de trabalho para se dedicarem aos filhos, é algo comum na Europa. 

""Ah, mas eu não tenho dinheiro pra me dar ao luxo de não trabalhar..."". Então, aí entra outra questão: estrutura. As famílias estão desestruturadas, começam do nada, sem rumo, sem planos. O ideal seria que o casal esperasse juntar algum dinheiro e ter algumas certezas antes de terem os filhos. E fazerem uma gravidez planejada (inclusive, por isso, sou a favor do aborto. Como eu disse, eu vejo aspectos posiviticos na **moral** religiosa). 

Enfim, são várias coisas. As igrejas também servem pata preencher lacunas que o Estado deixa (o trabalho que fazem nos presídios é muito melhor que o os ""agentes da lei"" fazem), prestam caridade, mantém a comunidade unida e serve de freio moral para algumas pessoas que infelizmente precisam disso para não saírem simplesmente matando por aí. 

**ÓBVIO** que eu não acho isso tudo perfeito. A igreja católica matou e torturou. Padres e pastores praticam pedofilia. Tem muita gente escrota e muitas ""leis"" da Bíblia que são indefensáveis. 

Mas a igreja deveria voltar a ter a relevância que tinha na sociedade. Na verdade, está voltando, mas só entre as classes mais baixas (igrejas evangélicas, principalmente). 

A ideia é que a religião seja domesticada no processo de integração com a sociedade (algo que o Islã precisa urgentemente). Os católicos hoje são muito mais abertos para questões sociais e os protestantes também estão indo nessa direção, entende? Não quero transformar o Brasil num califado ou papado, mas aproveitar os pontos positivos da religião e também contribuir para que elas não se radicalizem. É um processo complexo, mas amplamente benéfico. 

Infelizmente, tá ficando difícil se tornar real num futuro próximo. Ok, o Brasil ainda é um país de maioria cristã, mas olha os números de praticantes. Cada vez mais, as pessoa tão se isolando em bolhas do que acham que é certo e errado sob o escudo de ""acredito em Deus mas não vou à missa"".

But what it would not do is hit America and the only way it could ever come to America is with a missile.""

Different cultures will have their own version of vampires; for example:

- the East European *strigoi* and *nosferatu*, 
- the Icelandic *draugur*, 
- Jewish *aluka*, 
- Celtic *baobhan sith*, 
- West Africa's Ewe people's *adze*, 
- Aztec *cihuateteo*, 
- Chinese *jiangshi*, 

and so on.  

In modern culture, you of course have the Bram Stoker creation *Dracula*, Anne Rice's immortals like Lestat, and the ever so sparkly vampires of Twilight.

And interestingly, the Japanese *kyuuketsuki* was a really recent invention that arose largely for Japanese cinema; there aren't any true vampire equivalents in Japanese mythology, apparently, although there are many *bakemono* that will happily drink blood or those that are raised from the dead.

In the same vein, you might be interested to know that the *penanggal* or monsters like it can be found in mythologies ranging from Malaysia to Indonesia to the Philippines to as far as Cambodia.  The link here is Indian mythology: there is a North Indian monster called a *brahma rakshasa* which is basically a penganggal, except it has its intestines wrapped around its head.

Cameron went to Brussels and was refused any negotiations on the policy. We now have Europe in a overall weaker position and far right parties are gaining traction as shown in the recent Dutch election and the soon to be French election.

I'm not necessarily in favour of austerity (there still is a debate in economics about what would be best), however Greece had to reform painfully in social security, pensions, agriculture and retirement age anyhow to keep up, and without low interest rates investing now would only compound the problem. Greece just isn't competitive enough and wages have to come down to get there. Greece didnt become more competitive since the start of the 2000s, while countries like Germany did. However, the major problem with Greece was corruption. If they got the money from the richer parts of the population, they would be fine. Corruption is slowly fading, but still pervasive.

As for the EU, they bailed out Greece, but in return expect reforms. As you may know, they get periodic tranches of this bailout fund. This worked out pretty well up to now. Some work still has to be done, but the hardest part is over. The EU in return reformed some loans so that interest payments are lower for Greece and other EU countries do not make a profit from their loans to Greece.

However, Germany for example pays far lower interest than it would if the whole EU had low interest rates, saving them billions. Additionally, many assets in Greece are owned by Deutsche Bank. If the Greeks decided to default and devalue, Deutsche bank would have to write of a lot of assets, possibly needing the German government to step in.

No, or maybe, but not nearly as much as the media would like you to believe. Do you think that being liberal means being wishy washy with money? Conservativism is more of a spectrum (like gender). Here straight from Wikipedia:

&gt;American Conservatism is a broad system of political beliefs in the United States that is characterized by respect for American traditions, support for Judeo-Christian values, economic liberalism, anti-communism, and a defense of Western culture. Liberty is a core value, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the free market, limiting the size and scope of government, and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur. American conservatives consider individual liberty, within the bounds of conformity to American values, as the fundamental trait of democracy,

I have a reasonable opinion nevertheless. 

We live in a world in which the eurozone has brought about currency and monetary union, and fiscal and political union are widely touted as the answer to the seemingly never ending crisis. The phrase 'ever closer union' has been a stated goal of the European integration project since it was included in the Treaty of Rome in 1957.

National attitudes gyrate based on whoever has been voted into power, but as far as the EU itself and the permanent characters who administer it, ever closer union has been their raison d'être.

After Brexit, talk of ever closer union became a bit toxic, especially as populist movements gained a bit of momentum. Rutte famously had a row with Schultz at Davos claiming that 'ever closer union' was dead. When things settle, lets see. 

We know that Target2 imbalances mean that it's literally impossible for Italy and the like to leave the eurozone without facing complete national bankruptcy and instigating a global crisis, and that the only touted resolution is fiscal and political union.

CyclopsRock,,,"It's an ideal - indeed, almost the only - platform on which to perform scientific experiments where having (nearly) no gravity is important - for example, they have sent animals and plants up there to see how they react to a lack of gravity; this can teach us something about how they work which in itself has nothing to do with space, but relies on removing the variable of gravity from the equation. 

Beyond that, it's very useful for developing technology for space travel in a *relatively* safe but useful environment. The ISS is build with a lot of locks in place which means that a problem in one area can be isolated. This way they can send up test functions and see if they work ""in situ"" (rather than in a lab on earth), safe in the knowledge that if the worst comes to the worst the astronauts aboard can jump into their Soyez and get the hell out. One example of this is the Bigelow inflatable module, which is basically a giant balloon that's stuck to the side of the ISS. This may later be used for long-duration missions (for example to Mars) so that the astronauts have a lot more space for the journey without being limited by the size of what they can send up there (because it's inflated in space). 

Thirdly, it enables us to study the long term impacts of low gravity on the human body. One thing we have learned is that the eyeballs actually change shape slightly after extended periods in low gravity. It's obviously better that we discover this in the relatively safe surroundings of Low Earth Orbit rather than, say, half way to Mars. 

Fourthly, the *international* part of the ISS has three major benefits: i) It fosters international cooperation between countries that haven't always seen eye to eye. ii) It keeps the costs down for all the countries involved, who have access to a large space that they either couldn't afford normally or would eat up a larger part of their budget due to the pooling of resources and iii) It enables smaller countries to develop their own space technology and concentrate on small, specialised areas that, developed on their own, would be pointless. For example, the ESA - the combined European Space Agency - contributed (amongst other things) a supply vehicle (the ATV) to the ISS, which sent up supplies. This vehicle would have been largely useless without the ISS, as it would have no where to go and the ESA could not really afford (or justify) their own space station. This vehicle, however, it being incorporated into NASA's Orion space craft which will (all things going well!) go to Mars at some point. So, by being part of the ISS, the ESA is able to gain this specialism and experience in space travel it wouldn't otherwise get.

(as can be seen in rallies of MRA's where it counts as a big number if 20 people show up, and those people dont belong to a counterdemonstration).

also i might add that i am not really an mra, visitationrights dont interest me much, as someone who never wants to marry or have kids. (false fatherhood claims are more interesting, but even there its only a subset of people that are concerned with that)

I think if the MRA wants to become better established they need to speak more about topics that the mayority of the population WANTS to relate to out of self interest. for example the difference between men and women who get a higher education.

Byzantinenova,,,"LOOK AT THE LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION FML... im the only one talking about the most important statistic with Unemployment rate... 

You cant just say 8% unemployment... you need to also account for all the fucking people in the fucking labour market. People who have a job, employed persons, and people willing and able to work who are looking for a job, unemployed persons... 

The Labour force participation rate is the number of people that are driving the economy...

for example:

**UK has 4.5% unemployment but has 78.4% labour force participation**... meaning less than 1/4 of the population is not in the labour market and 72% of the population is working...

http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/labor-force-participation-rate

**Whilst in Germany, who has 3.9% unemployment... only has a labour force participation of 61.3%**... meaning some 58.2% of people work...

http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/labor-force-participation-rate

So its not Germany has better economic/unemployment.... Its UK has relatively more people working... 72% of the population as opposed to 58.2%...

Then the fucking EU Area...

**The EU has 9.5% unemployment but 57.1% labour force participation...**

http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/labor-force-participation-rate

That means in the EU as a whole less than 50% of people actually work... in the EU 48.6% of people work... thats not good at all... then you contrast that to the UK which has 72% of their population employed. Thats a difference of 24.6%... 

Thus, this is a deceptive diagram, its not apples to apples. Its very very different... you must have the labour force participation states to act as the medium to compare each country...


Thats why the UK wanted to remove the free movement of people, thats why migration to the UK is a huge problem. As the EU said you MUST let people in, the UK has become too competitive, to many people have wages and thats driving up inflation significantly. Thats the inherit problem with the EU... but no stopping migration is racism... because the reason for the UK's high labour force participation is EU workers working in the UK, who are included in that %%...


Eddit:

Look at the Czech Republic for example...

http://www.tradingeconomics.com/czech-republic/labor-force-participation-rate

Best unemployment at 3.2%, but has a labour force participation rate of 60.2%... that means 57% of people work...

which means they are lower than Germany, and also means as they approach [NAIRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIRU) there will be more wage competition...

Also 2012 was the Czech Republic's lowest Labour force participation rate ever.. (at 58.2%) and at that time they had ~7.2% unemployment... meaning 51% of people were employed... since then they have increased the labour force participation rate by 2% and decreased unemployment a lot...

Thats good because it means the Czech Republic is employing people who want a job but for 5 years has not be able to attract more workers relative to the ones leaving by more than 2%... So their relative worker pool is not growing...",True,0,1493725633,,1493726353,0,dh0xi3s,t3_68segf,t3_68segf,1496190753,-22,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,

PotatoPotential,team phx,,"I just don't know how important founding teams and legacies are. When you're talking about hundreds of thousands of spectators, it's hard for me to not be biased and try to guess what it means to the big picture. It definitely has weight though.

The reason I have doubts is the fact eSports is an accelerated scene. A player playing for a team for 2 years feels like a lifetime probably from all points of view. When people post highlights from 2 years ago, I feel very nostalgic like someone reminding me of very fond moments from when I was a young child.

So personally, when comparing to NA's big four founding teams, those staple teams in any league naturally get filled if there is somewhat of a void. Honestly think for NA, it went from TSM, CLG, TL/Curse, Dig to just TSM, CLG and C9. Losing C9 would probably hurt more than losing both Dig and TL at the same time.

Winning obviously has a strong correlation as well not only in perception, but typically these organizations simply work harder. Great teams are typically built and not put together and that takes time. Therefore, you get to grow with certain players for multiple splits wearing the same uniform. Organizations that typically have better funding also market very well. There's a lot of variables to consider.

So yeah. I agree with the other guy. I think while a long (and rich) history has its weight, it's not as important as you may think. Most of the audience is young and have short attention spans. It's drilled into our heads that the past isn't that relevant when it comes to in-game performance and strategies because of meta shifts and that culture extends throughout.

Another big variable is Riot. Riot obviously cares more about NA than EU. EU has worse streaming days and their schedule was cut short this split. NA teams are simply more attractive to sponsors. As far as those 3-4 big names in each region though, I feel they are comparable relative to their region. Sometimes your legacy simply hurts you. For example Dig. Now because they've been a long standing organization even outside of League, maybe Dig fans are way more die-hard than any G2, H2K, or UoL fan, but to the general audience, are probably ranked last. Die-hard fans are a minority though.

BobTurnip,,,"You are correct, we had a unique deal. But I think the UK had lots of concessions and exceptions and vetos in place, because as a nation we never really enthusiastically embraced the EU project. Brexit has not sprung from nowhere, it's been brewing for decades.

Coming from a slightly different historical point after the war, we didn't join the EU until 1970's, when France decided to allow us in, and a referendum was held for membership of a single market. There was no mention of ""ever closer union"" or of a grand centralised political and legal union. That came afterwards, without any democratic input. I think in the collective conscience of many in the UK who voted back then, they felt that they had been cheated into joining something different to what they voted for. I suppose my views are shaped by being ""in between"" generations. I am generation x, so I grew up watching the EU change and affect us.

Immigration probably is the main issue for many. In the UK we haven't taken half as many of the recent refugees compared to other EU countries. But we have seen our population grow by approximately300,000 per year from within the EU over recent years. That number has generally grown year on year. On a relatively small island, that's the equivalent to a small city, each year. Personally, I think immigration is a good thing - it's healthy generally, and we certainly depend on it for our economy and services. I am proud to live in a famously tolerant and multicultural society. But I also believe population needs to be planned for, and we cannot plan if we have no control over numbers. Talking about a healthy economy is useless if we have absolutely no idea what our population will be in 5 years time.

We also have close ties to other countries around the world. We necessarily restrict migration from those other countries, and yet we are prohibited from doing so with European migration. It could even be argued that this results in discriminatory, perhaps even racist policy - people from India or Africa are restricted, but Europeans are free to come in uncontrolled numbers. Personally I would have settled for us to get some kind of flexibility from the EU on the subject of free movement. David Cameron tried but was quickly rejected. Free movement is one of the foundations of the whole project, not for negotiation, so the only way for us to control and plan for housing, schools and hospitals is to leave. 

Historically the UK is a global-looking island, with close ties to many countries, not least our commonwealth partners, but our trade and partnerships with those other countries are restricted by the EU.

In recent years we have been unable to extradite known terrorists because the EU has blocked us from being able to do so. Whilst there are many good things that have come out of the EU, there are  laws and restrictions that feel increasingly undemocratic, over-ruling our elected government.

And I guess there's the main point - those in favour of Brexit don't view themselves as part of the EU, but instead view the EU as an outside force - increasingly power-hungry, relatively undemocratic,  a beauracratic monster of an organisation which tries to have too much influence and control.

We didn't join the Euro - a decision derided across Europe at the time, with forecasts of inevitable economic disaster. We took a risk, and prospered as a result. I view Brexit as similar. It's a dash for increased independence, and a chance to draw our own future, with all the risks that such moves always have.

I have family in France, and I know how we are viewed on mainland Europe. The UK has long been an obstructive, difficult , unenthusiastic member of the EU, and it's probably only fair that we leave the EU to continue its journey towards its destination without us dragging awkwardly along.

GMO means genetically modified organism, which also includes selective breeding, cross breedig/splicing etc.

While in the green fear mongering sense it usually only refers to spooky lab stuff.

However one of the biggest arguments in favor of lab GMO over breeding GMO is the fact that, in the lab we have actual control over what genomes we modify, while with random mutations you get a whole bag of stuff which you don't know the risks off.

When farmers, and breeders select a new plant or animal, that organism has had not just one genome changed, but a bunch, of which the breeders are not aware of, meaning more risk for both ecosystem, and consumers.

While when Scientists change the gene of a plant or animal in the lab they do it precise without any random other genomes affected.

Therefor the modern way of modifying organisms genetically is in principle not just more effective but also safer.

And aside of that, no study has concluded any health risks because of GMO food.

And we have GMO food in Europe as well, so called ""BIO"" (""natural"") products are also more expensive than the regular version of it, and usually reserved for upper middle class consumers, while the lower classes have to get by with the regular version of those foods.

&gt; Viza has infiltrated the global music scene with an explosive sound of international rock. You can hear the blasts and screams from the depths of Eastern Europe to the deserts of the Middle East. Formerly known as Visa, Viza exchanged the audio passport with a carte blanche for invasion.

&gt; 
Viza is a brigade of 9 international musicians from Los Angeles, integrating duduk, percussion and oud with the hard edge of rock. K’noup, the fearless leader and voice of Viza, commands the stage with charisma and stamina. As Visa, the band released two EPs and two full length albums, along with an award winning music video. In the De Facto and Eros albums, the music is pervaded by sonorities taken from Arabic, Armenian and Greek traditions blended with elements of rock and dance. In the newly released album, Made in Chernobyl, Russian and Eastern European styles and themes take center stage. Viza is a passport into a musical endeavor that touches its conspirators, cultural, spiritual, and literal influences, while translating them into a perfect balance of old world nostalgia, modern experimentation and social revival.

&gt; 
Viza is currently managed by Serjical Strike Management headed by Serj Tankian from System of a Down. With sold out shows in the US and Canada, Viza fans are now also tuned in around the world. In August 2010, Viza embarked on a special tour in Europe, opening for Serj Tankian’s “Imperfect Harmonies” tour in the cities of Yerevan, Athens, Hamburg, Cologne, Paris, Zurich and Bologna. Viza captivated their audiences with their edgy performances and experienced raving reviews from fans in every city.

&gt; The row erupted after a detailed account of a dinner between Mrs May and EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker last week was leaked to a German newspaper.

&gt; Tory Eurosceptics say the EU of trying to &amp;#039;bluff&amp;#039; its way out of a weak negotiating position and claim that Mr Juncker is bent on trying to &amp;#039;punish&amp;#039; Britain for voting Leave last year.

&gt; After the Prime Minister raised the prospect of settling a deal on the rights of EU and British citizens living abroad in June, Mr Juncker reportedly said: &amp;#039;I think you are underestimating this, Theresa.

Edit: Okay, so I did some googling. The map is from wikipedia but the article doesn't confirm the statements about ""Nordic"" or ""Germanic"" law in Europe at all. The creator of the map offers two sources. [The first one](http://www.juriglobe.ca/eng/sys-juri/index-alpha.php#GERMANY) doesn't use those terms at all. Just civil, common and mixed law for Europe. [The second one](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Legal_systems_in_Europe.svg) is just another map on wikicommons and it seems to be where the terms are derived from. It offers no sources whatsoever.

I think it might be an error in the translation (the creator of the second source map seems to be Russian). So ""Germanic"" should be ""German"" meaning an specific arrangement of (civil, Roman origin) Private law and Public law.

_Sagacious_,s1 5 team-5 country-eng,Tottenham Hotspur,"&gt; The English game is often described as less smart and less tactically focused than other European leagues for example Italy being a league where tactical awareness is considered much more a part of the game whereas the English is more about high physicality and directness.

Yeah, somewhat.

English football has been and is deeply ingrained in a hyper-macho, working-class culture where technical players are derided as soft and tactics are secondary to going in hard.

This has obviously eased up a lot but can still be seen today in Paul Merson's reaction to Hull hiring Marco Silva. The fetishisation of players wearing black boots and derision towards Paul Pogba's general appearance and attitude.

Nobody knows exactly when it was ready because it was all classified and we can't even be sure what we know now hasn't been doctored or altered. Even if they had it 6 months before the test, it wouldn't have been used in the European theatre anyway, so we don't know the earliest possible date it could've happened. As I said, the date doesn't actually matter because: 

&gt;Also, the Brits were years behind the US in research, so they were never close because it took them 4 more years.

This is completely false. You obviously don't have a clue about the history here. 

Britain didn't have any research of her own after they fully got on board with the Manhattan project because all the key scientists that had been working on the British nuclear programme went to the US to work on that. I don't think you understand that the Manhattan project didn't really get going until an agreement was made between the UK, US, and Canada to pool their military nuclear research projects and resources (The US needed Canadian uranium). 

They wasn't much of a parallel UK competing with the US once the Quebec agreement was made, the UK were giving all their nuclear resources to the US at this stage as it had become pointless to try to compete given how much the US was spending. Britain was spending all its time and resources on fighting a conventional war and was ill positioned to develop such a hi-tech experimental weapon. It took Britain four more years after the war because America didn't share the spoils of the Manhattan project with them as had been agreed by Roosevelt. Britain had to recall her scientists and re-engineer the whole project from an imperfect knowledge of the product they'd helped to build in the US. 

What you don't seem to understand is that it was Britain that started the research first and it was Britain that gave the Americans the impetus to build the bomb in the first place, so while the research in the US in the Manhattan project quickly outstripped what the British had achieved with far more limited resources during war time, prior to this point the British were well ahead of the US in terms of having more and better resources dedicated to actually creating a nuclear weapon. Their contribution both advanced the American project by years and made people realise that a bomb was more than just a pipe dream and that there was a danger that other countries might feasibly build one before the allies.

&gt;America would have still had the bomb if Britain fell, because we already had all the scientists in America.

No you didn't. You didn't get the scientists until the Manhattan project started. If Britain had fallen before this point then it's possible Germany would've got the scientists. You also would've been vastly more behind as the pressure to build a bomb fast wouldn't have existed. From wikipedia:

&gt;In July 1940, Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research,[11] and the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.[12]

Had the British not entered the war, or been swiftly defeated, there would've been no impetus for the project to become as powerful and well funded as it did. It was the realisation that Britain had been ahead on a bomb that made the Americans wake up to the need develop one and justified spending over a billion dollars on development. The bomb would've come much later, and given that without Britain America would've probably stayed out of the war as it originally hoped to there wouldn't be the existential threat driving the project. A war winning, European mainland controlling Germany would've been better placed to build a bomb given how it had already militarised and was hell bent on conquer while in this timeline the US would've probably have had a policy of neutrality and hoped to avoid the war completely. 

I know it might hurt your fragile American patriot ego to hear that if Britain hadn't had stood up against Hitler and allied with the US then America could've been conquered by a nuclear third Reich, but it's certainly a possibly in such an alternative timeline if clearly not a guaranteed outcome. Nobody can know for certain who would've got the bomb first if Britain had stayed out of the war or surrendered early on, and nobody can say when the bomb would've been developed, but there's definitely a chance it would've been Germany.

&gt;During the period 2010-2014, the number of trips for personal purposes remained relatively stable - around 1 040 million trips per year with an average duration of 5.4 nights per trip.

Jag väljer att räkna vad jag tror är lågt, och säger att vi kan dela antalet resor ovan med 10 då det kan vara så att det är samma personer som reser flera gånger.

Med det så har vi 104 miljoner turister inom Europa per år.

Under samma tidsperiod så har ca. 110 personer dött till följd av terroristattacker inom Europa (varav 77 vid samma attentat av Breivik), vilket ger 22 personer per år. Hittar ingenting på nationalitet av de som dött förutom de i Norge.

Om vi väljer att räkna att alla andra dödsoffer var turister (vilket de inte var), har vi 33 turister som har dött i terroristattacker. Nu vill jag varna om att jag suger på matte, men efter att ha räknat lite snabbt så får jag ut siffran 3432000.

Alltså är det 1 på 3432000 turister som dör i terroristattacker per år inom Europa. Och det när jag har tagit i överkant vad gäller de flesta nummer.

Ska dock tilläggas att jag inte har granskat källorna.

PiousHeathen,,,"It always amazes me how much of the Second World War had its foundations in the short shortsightedness of the western powers after WW1 and how racism was the driving factor in events which had very long term ramifications.

It was the US's unwillingness to sign the League of Nation's proposal for the enforcement of racial equality for member states of the League that was part of a group of reasons that caused Japan to withdraw from their western allies after WW1. Japan was one of the members that proposed the bill in the first place. Japan had adhered meticulously to the rules of engagement and the Geneva convention (when interacting with western, primarily German POWs, indigenous peoples of South East Asia and people in China were not so lucky). Japan was a primary signatory at the Treaty of Versailles due to the contributions in the Asian theatre of the war, especially the capture of Tsingtao. Japan had supplied arms, defended ships in the Mediterranean and provided UBoat defence in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. Japan had worked hard to fulfill its international obligations and act as a true partner to ther European allies (there is a valid case to be made about Japan ""feathering their nest"" throughout the war as one British diplomat put it, but that is a topic for another day). Japan and other Asian allies such as China were treaty extremely poorly by their post-war allies.

Panics about the ""Yellow Peril"" of Asian immigrants into the US and Canada caused governments to promote policies of exclusion, to the point that in one case after the war, a ship call the Komagata Maru filled with Punjabi immigrants (and citizens of the British Empire) tried to immigrate to Canada (which was still part of the British Empire.) The Canadian government changed it's laws while preventing the ship from docking in order to use the changed law to force the Indians to return home without landing in Canada. (Many of the Punjab Indians who were on that ship were veterans and officers of the British Army who served in WW1, and when they returned home began the process of fighting for Indian independence. This probably would not have happened if not for Canada's racist response to them wanting to live in BC). Australia also pursued extremely racist policies toward aboriginal populations at this same time, and supported the actions against the Japanese for similarly racially motivated reasons. Japan was until this time a very close ally of England through the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and England's withdrawal from that arrangement was done in part at the behest of Canada and Australia (around concerns of a ""Yellow Wave"" of Japanese, Chinese, and Indians overtaking their shores) and due to the disastrous outcome of the Siberian Intervention after the war.

So yes, ""thank"" the Nazis that it took a second world war after nearly 50 years of intermittent conflict and the deaths of millions for the European powers to recognize that policies of racist exclusion create hostile, unstable, and violent political and social environments, up to and including institutionalized hate like the Third Reich.
