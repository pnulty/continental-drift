And my SNES got a 60Hz switch so the games did run better and uses the whole screen. But when they really used the US roms, then wouldn't the games be in english only? Only the PAL roms had multi language, I think.

These peoples were not one homogeneous group. They constantly warred with and married into each other. Some were exterminated or swallowed up by others. Alliances, rivalries, and adversaries existed. When Europeans made contact, the tribes took advantage of newly introduced goods and techniques to further agricultural, hunting, trade, logistics, and prowess in war - with or against each other.

There were opposing peoples who sided with different European powers in the hopes to gain their enemy's resources, land, and treasures. While they saw Europeans as alien and bizarre, early on the Europeans were only in the periphery of the peoples' strategies and considerations. The tribes had little to no knowledge of a centuries-long global struggle originating thousands of miles across the ocean, partially due to concepts of empires and kingdoms which were foreign to them, and monotheistic religions which they could not comprehend.

Not many tribes sent emissaries to the homelands of the aliens. Even less were successful. Apart from contact with traders, and agreements with local officials, diplomacy was very limited. High level diplomacy was very uncommon. Useful knowledge about the politics that drove the settlement and colonial policies of European kingdoms remained out of reach for most. The ones that held this knowledge became the wealthiest and most powerful, and the most likely to negotiate successfully for their own ends.

Communication with distant tribes was difficult, which the introduction of horses helped alleviate. The land was sparsely populated by agriculture-reliant tribes, and nomadic tribes didn't always come back to the same places when the season changed. To make matters worse, transfer and storage of knowledge mostly came down to word of mouth and memory. Apart from the broken telephone effect, messengers could be already holding obsolete information. To bring tribes together was an achievement, but to unify a large amount of them across a large swath of land would have been almost unthinkable.

The European powers didn't defeat a race. They steadily manipulated and destroyed hundreds of tribes across the Americas who were unaware of each other for most of their existence, unable to communicate with other over long distances, unwilling to engage in diplomatic negotiations even between each other, and thus not competent enough in statecraft to realize the threat that empires posed to their existence.",True,False,0,1498867900,,False,0,djmlirn,t3_6kdhml,t1_djm6v2h,1499806625,3,False,uwaterloo,t5_2rb5s,
,zorba1994,,,"Liberal originally referred to the political philosophy of Liberalism (now generally referred to as ""Classical Liberalism""). This ideology was born out of Enlightenment thought, focusing on the right of the individual to free speech, free commerce, representative democracy etc. This definition is used as self-identification by some European political parties (such as the British Liberal-Democrats). In practical American terms, Liberalism is more or less the ideology of all but the most progressive end of the Democratic Party, and the left-through-center wing of the Republican party (which is on life support these days, but used to actually be a significant political demographic, think Eisenhower).

In American discourse, for reasons I'm not entirely familiar with, ""liberal"" became shorthand for the left-wing, while ""conservative"" filled up the right (despite the fact that many conservatives still draw on liberal ideals). This is the definition you're probably most familiar with, and is used by most Americans.

Meanwhile, groups farther to the left, such as socialists and anarchists, usually use the original sentiment of the word liberal to derisively bemoan pro-capitalist attitudes. In this lens, virtually the entirety of the American political establishment is liberal, with the exception of the far-right, which teeters into religious fundamentalism and out-right fascism, depending on which specific camp you're talking about.


Finally, there's ""neoliberalism"", which refers to a political trend, starting in the 70s, of endorsing laissez-faire capitalism and far more extensive market deregulation than even previous forms of capitalist liberalism. It really hit full steam in the 90s when Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party fully embraced it, moving the party away from the more Keynesian, big-government policies of the New Deal that were historically associated with the Democratic Party . Its supporters see it as a new era of shining economic promise, whereas its detractors view it as a terrifying lurch rightward, freeing up business interests to pursue riskier and less ethical behaviors while paying less taxes and exacerbating economic inequality.

When Americans get married, and especially when they have kids, their whole world turns in on their family. It's like an implosion. Frankly, I'm amazed these people go out at all. Most parents I know just stop having a social life altogether.

In Europe and Israel (where I lived), parents had a life outside of their families. They still went out with their friends—separate from their spouses. I even knew one couple that still went to raves and got drunk and did peyote in the desert, but obviously only when one parent stayed at home with the kid. And they were amazing, wonderful parents with the happiest baby I've ever known. It was eye-opening for me, being American.

Part of me feels like the American thing isn't a lack of desire for a family-separate social life. I honestly think a great deal of it has to do with people's bullshit thinking that it's somehow ""inappropriate"" or ""un-adult"" to have fun the ways they used to once you've had kids. So instead of enjoying themselves (independently), they look down on the people who do as immature and selfish.

,kieslowskifan,qualitycontributor,Top Quality Contributor,"Although the BoB and the Blitz have monopolized public memory of the air assault on Allied countries, air attacks continued throughout the war. Attacks on the UK saw a shift away from pursuing allegedly military objectives to pure retaliation. The Baedeker Raids in the spring of 1942 were explicitly targeting UK sights of cultural and historical significance as retaliation for the RAF's nightbombing of German cities. German air raids continued sporadically after Baedeker and the last massed manned air assaults on the UK were in January to May 1944 with Operation Steinbock. These raids ran into the teeth of an increasingly effective Allied air defense network and aside from *Jabo* attacks by single-seat fighters, most bombers units had difficulty maintaining an acceptable ratio of losses to sorties to remain functioning. These diminishing returns underlay the move to the V-1 and V-2 which although they lacked the accuracy of a manned bomber, could reach their targets. The last manned air attack on London occurred in the night of 29/30 May 1944, and Luftwaffe aircraft after Normandy were restricted to either conducting manned V-1 attacks on the UK or pinprick intruder raids against Allied airfields, like Operation Gisela in 3/4 March 1945 where nightfighters followed home an RAF bomber stream and attacked them in the process of landing on UK airfields. 

The UK of course was not the only Allied country. There were also Luftwaffe attacks on the Low Countries as Allied forces liberated them as well as attacks on Red Army forces in Poland.  Luftwaffe aircraft did bomb Warsaw during the 1944 rising and the level of destruction did hearken back to an earlier period where Germany held air superiority. V-2 raids continued on Antwerp until March 1945 and Operation Bodenplatte on 1 January 1945 saw a massed German air attack on Belgian and French airfields.

The Luftwaffe did maintain reconnaissance and isolated intruder flights over Western Europe and to a lesser extent, Eastern and Southern Europe through the war's end. But by mid-1944, the Luftwaffe was a broken reed that could not accomplish much. Its manned bomber missions could not be conducted during daylight hours and fuel shortages meant the planes could not take to the skies in adequate numbers. This meant that after Steinbock, the German air raids were pinpricks dwarfed by the truly massive Allied aerial armadas. None of these manned raids met with a degree of success and only the Warsaw bombing accomplished much in the way of destruction- and here the Luftwaffe had the benefit of the Red Army running at the limits of its supply lines as well as Stalin's political refusal to help the Home Army. Even if the objectives of Luftwaffe bombing shifted from military ones to simply extracting a cost in Allied civilian lives the manned force as incapable of meeting that goal.

And yeah the youth is more diverse, especially in France. Take out the immigrants and their kids and suddenly the majority of actual French kids are lining up with the rest of the study. 

And yeah the study is pretty damning. Over half of Europeans according to the study want the equivalent of a TOTAL ban on the muslim world. The doesn't mean 45% like it or are even not against. Just that they aren't for a total ban.

This, to me, indicates Europeans are overwhelmingly negative toward Islam and muslims. Which, tbh, reflects the general vibe I have here in France (that said, I live on the border of a muslim neighborhood so the problems in that community are very pronounced around me).

Anyway, mate, I don't think we're ever going to see eye to eye. I don't like Islam or a strong muslim presence in my country, maybe you do. You do you. But please do not try to make it look like we're happy with it. Most of us aren't.

I was at a bus stop with one of my friends at around 7PM. I notice movement behind me and I turn around (you can never be too careful after dark). I see a strange guy, just sliding his fingers (he had long, pointed fingernails) up and down the bricks of the bus shelter (like how little kids in school slide their fingers around like they have rollerblades on their fingers.) 

This drew my attention partly because it seemed such a weird place to do such things. I glanced around without drawing too much attention, he seemed like a homeless guy but no, he had really expensive clothes on, like Prada and shit like that. 

Unfortunately I was probably too obvious - he noticed me and walked over, standing right between me and my friend. 

This is the disturbing part. He looked RIGHT into my eyes - I could feel them burning into my skull, and I was somewhat compelled to look back. And at this instant I just had a sense of knowing - the name 'Jimmy C' just popped into my head and I knew that was his name. Strange, I've never known anyone called Jimmy C. 

I couldn't help but keep looking into his face - those grey pinpoint eyes just stared into me. I noticed his teeth, unusually sharp and probably deliberately filed, and his constant lip-licking, his mouth full of saliva like a dog's. He just didn't seem quite human. 

This is the worst part. He looked even deeper and spoke in a language that appeared nonhuman. It was some kind of half-growl, in an accusing tone that sent shivers down my spine.

I said 'I don't understand.'

He made a grunting noise and finally spoke, in a sort of heavy European accent, 'John. We've been watching you.
This is your last chance. 
You know what you've done and you know our kind will not tolerate this.'

Confused, I barely managed to squeak out a 'What?'

He ignored me. 'You know who I am. You see my car?' - points to a new Volkswagen Beetle. 'Next time I come you will know by my black Mercedes. But by then its too late for you.' he fucking hissed at me.

He was about to continue but my bus arrived and I thankfully got on. The thing was, he left immediately. Seemed like he was there just to talk to me, not to wait for a bus. He frickin knew I was there. How?

I still don't understand. I haven't been involved in anything dodgy so I don't understand much of what he said. The bit about ' our kind' freaks me out and I still have nightmares about this guy. Especially about being followed on the highway by a black Mercedes.

They studied the haplotypes and haplogroups of 26 ancient human specimens from the Krasnoyarsk area in Siberia dated from between the middle of the 2nd millennium BC and the 4th century AD (Scythian and Sarmatian timeframe). Nearly all subjects belong to haplogroup R-M17 (European haplogroup). The authors suggest that their data shows that between Bronze and Iron Ages the constellation of populations known variously as Scythians, Andronovians, etc. **were blue- (or green-) eyed, fair-skinned and light-haired people** who might have played a role in the early development of the Tarim Basin civilization. Moreover, this study found that they were genetically more closely related to modern populations of eastern Europe than those of central and southern Asia.[53] The ubiquity and utter dominance of R1a Y-DNA lineage contrasts markedly with the diversity seen in the mtDNA profiles.

,Dhosti,,,"Vi que você editou o tópico, saber sua idade já ajuda bastante, mas eu precisava de mais informações. Sabendo sua idade posso te apresentar as seguintes possibilidades:


1. Você não precisa esperar até os 18 anos pra começar a trabalhar, com 16 anos você já pode conseguir uma sentença de emancipação (fazer com que você tenha maioridade legal sem ter 18 anos). Isso possibilitará que você trabalhasse sem autorização da sua mãe e, consequentemente, conseguisse dinheiro pra mudar de situação. Pra conseguir uma sentença de emancipação você precisa ir na defensoria pública da sua cidade ou num centro de atendimento jurídico de uma faculdade da região (todas as capitais costumam ter). Existem 4 situações que a lei estabelece pra conceder a emancipação: a) casamento; b) exercício de emprego público efetivo c) coloção de grau em curso superior; d) existência de estabelecimento civil ou empresarial que permita ao menor ter economia própria. Como vc viu, vc não se enquadra em nenhuma das hipóteses, então você precisa fazer o defensor Público ajuizar a ação mostrando que sua mãe recebe apenas um salário mínimo de benefício do governo e que, caso você seja emancipado, você conseguiria receber um valor equivalente. Se decidir fazer isso, você precisa levar uma cópia da sua identidade, copia de um comprovante de residência (conta de luz por exemplo) e cópia do comprovante da renda da sua mãe, além disso, levar qualquer prova que você tenha de que ela não deixa você trabalhar (conversa de whatsapp, gravação, por exemplo). Lá você vai precisar convencer o advogado a ajuizar a ação.


2. Você também pode tentar ingressar numa escola militar. São três escolas: o colégio naval, que aceita quem completou o ensino fundamental, a EPCAr (aeronáutica), que também aceita quem completou o ensino fundamental, e a EsPECx (exército), que aceita quem vai começar a cursar o último ano do ensino médio. São provas muito acirrada, por isso acho que você teria dificuldade em passar sem ter um ambiente propício para o estudo. Mas você tem isenção pela faixa de renda e, além disso, se você passar você iria se mudar imediatamente visto que eles pagam tudo para os alunos (moradia, alimentos, roupas, etc).

,_Discordian,,,"Edit: tl;dr: Obaur (pronounced oh-bar), kind of means the same thing as Batholomew in a roundabout way.

I'm always conflicted about names. I consider them to be one of the least important things about a character in terms of concept, but at the same time they can add a lot to an initial impression and general flair.

So here's my exploration process for creating neat names with a given input:

From the Aramaic, Bartholomew means ""Son of Tolmai"", or ""Tolmai's Son"" in the correct order of the roots.

The root ""son"" from Aramaic can mean ""to create"" in Hebrew, which makes a certain sense. Also ""to cut down"", but that's less inspirational.

Now, ""Tolmai"" in the Aramaic is apparently from ""Ptolemy"", the Greek name, and maybe some Biblical figure(s) as well (Tolmai might also mean something like ridge or furrow, but how boring is that?). Ptolemy comes from an Ancient Greek root and essentially means war or battle.

Googling tells me that lazy click-baiting name-meaning sites stop exploring the name Bartholomew at ""Son of Tolmai"", but a more correct rendition might be along the lines of ""Son of Battle"", or in the correct order of the roots, ""Battle-Son"".

So, given that the name Bartholomew is ultimately from an Afroasiatic language, with Greek (Indo-European) influence, let's convert those roots into something else entirely.

Basque is a language with no apparent relationship to any other known language. Sounds like a plan.

In Basque the words for ""war"" and ""battle"" both appear to be influenced by Spanish, so I went with the Basque for ""fight"", ""borroka"". ""Son"" is ""samea"", while child is ""haur"". Per Google the direct translation of ""fight-child"" is ""borroka-umea"".

So we've got some potential names, ""borroka samea"", ""borroka haur"", and ""borroka-umea"". We're talking about an Elven name, right, so get rid of those harsh consonants:

Boa samea

Boa aur

Boa umea


Then freely rearrange and anagram them so they don't sound like garbage, my first thought being ""boa"" = ""oba"". Ultimately, through a lot of rearranging, here's my suggestion:

Obaur (derived from the middle option, pronounced oh-bar)

In a certain sense it has the same meaning as ""Bartholomew"", and even has a vaguely similar sound to it.

***
&gt;WASHINGTON—A longtime Republican activist who led an operation hoping to obtain Hillary Clinton emails from hackers listed senior members of the Trump campaign, including some who now serve as top aides in the White House, in a recruitment document for his effort.

&gt;The activist, Peter W. Smith, named the officials in a section of the document marked “Trump Campaign.” The document was dated Sept. 7, 2016. That was around the time Mr. Smith said he started his search for 33,000 emails Mrs. Clinton deleted from the private server she used for official business while secretary of state. She said the deleted emails concerned personal matters. She turned over tens of thousands of other emails to the State Department.

&gt;As reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Smith and people he recruited to his effort theorized the deleted emails might have been stolen by hackers and might contain matters that were politically damaging. He and his associates said they were in touch with several groups of hackers, including two from Russia they suspected were tied to the Moscow government, in a bid to find any stolen emails and potentially hurt Mrs. Clinton’s prospects.

&gt;Mr. Smith’s purpose in listing the officials isn’t clear. There is no indication in the document that he sought or received any coordination from the campaign officials or the campaign in general.

&gt;Mr. Smith died in mid-May at age 81, about 10 days after he spoke to the Journal. He said he operated independently of the Trump campaign.

&gt;**Officials identified in the document include Steve Bannon, now chief strategist for President Donald Trump; Kellyanne Conway, former campaign manager and now White House counselor;** Sam Clovis, a policy adviser to the Trump campaign and now a senior adviser at the Agriculture Department; and retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, who was a campaign adviser and briefly was national security adviser in the Trump administration.

&gt;Mr. Bannon said he never met with Mr. Smith or anyone affiliated with a limited-liability company, KLS Research LLC, that the document said had been established for its mission. “Never heard of KLS Research or Peter Smith,” Mr. Bannon said.

&gt;Ms. Conway said she knew Mr. Smith from Republican politics but hadn’t spoken to him in years. “I never met with him” during the campaign, Ms. Conway said. “There were no calls, no meetings, no nothing.”

&gt;The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did the Agriculture Department, Mr. Clovis’s employer.

&gt;Mr. Flynn, his consulting firm Flynn Intel Group and his son Michael G. Flynn, who was chief of staff at Flynn Intel, were cited more extensively as Mr. Smith sought to recruit researchers, as well as in documents related to the effort that have been described to the Journal. Neither Mr. Flynn nor his son responded to requests for comment.

&gt;The names of the other campaign officials haven’t surfaced in connection with Mr. Smith’s work except in the document, which the Journal reviewed on Friday.

&gt;**The document section that lists campaign officials is followed by the words, “in coordination to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure.”—a possible reference to campaign strictures imposed by campaign finance and disclosure laws.**

&gt;The document was included in a package of opposition research Mr. Smith shared through an encrypted email with Matt Tait, a cybersecurity expert who once worked for British intelligence. Mr. Tait said he was approached last summer by Mr. Smith, who wanted him to help verify whether emails offered to the group by hackers came from Mrs. Clinton’s private serve.

&gt;After discussing his project by phone and in emails Mr. Smith gave him a document called the “KLS research packet,” which contained articles Mr. Smith planned to use for opposition research, Mr. Tait said. The packet cover sheet is the document that listed the Trump campaign officials. Mr. Smith’s name and phone number are typed at the bottom of it.

&gt;Mr. Smith asked Mr. Tait to sign a nondisclosure agreement. Mr. Tait said he declined and ceased communications with Mr. Smith, never reviewing any purported Clinton emails.

&gt;The document Mr. Smith presented to Mr. Tait, which he kept, is titled, “A Demonstrative Pedagogical Summary to be Developed and Released Prior to November 8, 2016,” which was Election Day.

&gt;It cites as the “preferred vehicle” for the effort a limited-liability company established in Delaware. Mr. Smith established KLS Research as that vehicle on Sept. 2, according to incorporation documents.

&gt;The House Intelligence Committee and its counterpart in the Senate are investigating Russian election meddling and whether there was coordination with the Trump campaign. So is Special Counsel Robert Mueller. President Trump has denied any collusion. The Russian government has denied it tried to interfere.

&gt;U.S. investigators have examined reports from intelligence agencies that tell of Russian hackers discussing how to get emails from Mrs. Clinton’s server and transmit them to Mr. Flynn via an intermediary, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence. It isn’t clear who the intermediary might have been or whether Mr. Smith’s operation was the one allegedly under discussion by the Russian hackers.

&gt;Mr. Smith said in the May interview he had assembled a group of technology experts, lawyers and a Russian-speaking investigator based in Europe to acquire emails his group theorized might have been stolen from Mrs. Clinton’s private server.

&gt;He said that after vetting batches of emails offered to him by hacker groups last fall, he couldn’t be sure enough of their authenticity to leak them himself and told the hackers to give them to WikiLeaks.

&gt;WikiLeaks has never published such emails or claimed to have them. In a statement to the Journal, it said, “WikiLeaks has never revealed a source and never will.”

,Sepahani,,,"With questions such as these (e.g. there are many similar questions regarding homosexual sex with children in ancient Greece), you have to understand some things before approaching the topic:

In antiquity, marriage was not about love, but primarly about wealth, offspring and power.
What we today consider incestuous marriages actually were practiced to various degrees in almost all Indo-European societies (e.g. Romans, Greeks, Iranians, etc.) and some non-Indo European societies (e.g. Jews, Babylonians, etc.). It was by no means an exclusively Iranian / Zoroastrian phenomenon. If you study ancient civilisations and tribes, you will find many customs which we today would not comprehend.
In 95% of the cases, incestuous marriages were reserved for the ruling elite (aristocracy) and perhaps the clergy, as they had the greatest need to keep their wealth in their dynasty. Therefore, you will find cases of incest in several acient kings’ and emperors’ families across cultures, while the average peasant most probably did not perform this kind of marriage (bear in mind that e.g. in ancient Persia, these types of marriage were prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of people).
As for xwedodah (the Zoroastrian case) in particular, it is unclear what the precise meaning / context of the term in the Avesta was. Later documents (written by priests) are more elaborate, but may be later interpretations that suited the needs of the ruling elites. In later times, xwedodah was understood as marriage between cousins — again, the meaning had changed.
While there may have been incestuous marriages, most forms of xwedodah were probably symbolic (e.g. marrying your dead father) and served as a means to keep the wealth in the family.
In general, bear in mind that TODAY’S taboos are the result of social construction over centuries. In ancient Greece, homosexuality (and paedophilia, for that matter) was not only okay, but encouraged. Later, homosexuality was considered a sin. The same applies for incest in various cultures and many other social norms.
Thus, to answer your question of WHY Zoroastrianism allows incest marriages, it can be said that incest marriages were primarily later codified by priests (Zarathustra and the Avesta do not mention incest, but later priestly epistles discuss the topic), and that they served a social function (allocation of wealth for the elites) and were probably not common outside the top few percent of the society.

From a psychological point of view, I even doub’t that cases of close incest were common in any layer of society anywhere in the world, except if e.g. siblings were separated at birth. There is an evident psychological barrier to engage in sexual activity with people who you grew up with as children (research findings based on Israeli Kibutzim clearly showed this).",True,False,0,1498876585,,False,0,djmri0e,t3_6kjcv5,t1_djmqv6z,1499809600,7,False,iran,t5_2qhzq,

The payouts from ESEA per month are the same all the way down to 8th. You make $50 more finishing 9th 4-weeks in a row now, and $100 more for finishing 10th 4-weeks in a row, but other than that the payouts are identical. There are some increases in AU/BR but that still doesn't add up. How does that extra $300 each month in NA/EU combined, and $600 in BR/AU combined add up to over a $100+K difference in winnings over a years time? From what I can tell ESEA only upped the yearly winnings by $10,800 for all regions combined. Pretty simple math, $900 * 12 Months = $10,800.

Not to knock the change, I'm just confused here. I think the changes overall are great, the weekly system will make more pros play, it won't reward people with no other obligations just grinding for an entire month, and it's overall a good change. IMHO any increase is great and $10,800 is still an increase. I just want someone to clarify if I'm actually missing anything. 

Edit: There are 13x 4 Week blocks in a year, not 12, so $11,700. Getting closer I guess.

I don't think accents are *hugely* important. None of the places in game directly correspond to real-world places or languages so it's kind of hard to tell what accent they'd have. I appreciate offer of help, but unfortunately I don't think British really fits for the setting.

&gt;Guys who roleplay women well play them for their personalities and relationships to everyone else and not their sex. 

Yeah one of my personal crusades with this particular campaign (along with ""not all fantasy has to be generic Medieval/Early Renaissance Europe"") has been putting in lots of cool female characters who go beyond standard ""woman in fantasy setting"" without going too hard on the ""oh wow look how I just subverted this trope so *unusual* so *subversive* are you guys impressed?"" thing. I'm not too worried that I don't know how to put believable women in my game, and more that it'll be hard to keep immersion when lines from certain characters the players already have some defined mental image of are suddenly being delivered by my (very recognizable) voice.

One learns from the best.  If the fans and lobbyists are going to slobber all over them, then perhaps we need an equally childish response.  I’ve seen little reason to repay SpaceX and their fan’s arrogance and cultism with civility.  So when I see someone slobbering on a billionaire's knob, I'm inclined to point and laugh at them.



•SLS is an expensive boondoggle that should never have been forced upon NASA. As a method of getting humans into space, it's overpriced, will launch far too rarely, has no funded payloads, and throws away most of its hardware. Largely it's a jobs program to keep money flowing to certain Congressional districts. 'Under no circumstances'? Why not? You remind me of someone called Billgamesh, who was adamant that SLS was the only true rocket, all others were hobby vehicles, and only the government should ever have any control over spaceflight.


Not embracing reusability is one thing that will keep SLS at a modest flight rate (2 per year.  Which incidentally is how many Soyuz per year the USSR flew for a while).  Boondoggle is relative but thats the narrative that you all are pushing.  SLS has 2 EM missions, 2 probes and 1 cargo mission funded.  With further unfunded plans for 6 EM missions, that is not “no missions” unless we start seriously moving the goal posts.  “Under no circumstances” is because its *not in the government’s interest to pay for and maintain a Mars colony.*  Work on reading comprehension.  Who cares if its a jobs program?  Are those jobs not “real” because they come from the government?



•Commercial Space Act of 1998


Tell me, what vehicle exists right now today?  (BFR doesn’t count, and there will be news about changes to that soon.)  SLS is being built now, and when BFR and New Armstrong or whatever are well-flown, that will be the perfect time to transition out of SLS with minimal disruption.  Do you expect congress to hold NASA down and force them to kill SLS in order to comply with the letter of the law?  The senate committees chaired by people with interests there?  Thats how the sausage is made honey, and of all the things these politicians do that is deplorable, “defending the livelihood of their constituents” is pretty much their job description.

•And even if it were canceled - that's no reason to keep centers open just because they already exist. We don't use that mindset with the military, why should we for any other government branch? Not to mention that shutting down SLS is not a guarantee that various NASA facilities would close as it is. And - you're the only person who's called them redundant.


I didn't call them redundant, I said SpaceX fans were treating them as if they were, again reading comprehension.  Any attempt to shut down SLS seriously would in fact involve closing several centers, and laying off most everyone near or in them.  Otherwise they will have nothing to do and cost money to maintain (which SpaceX fans will use against them), since the next step is that people will wield the CSA 1998 to indicate that NASA should build nothing at all in fact.  (already being advocated)



•What makes it ridiculous? Why is it a mockery of space science? Why should the government have exclusive control? Why should we ignore Mars simply because the rest of the world wants to go to the Moon? There's room in the USA and in space for various public/private entities to do both - we have the resources and the talent, if not the political will.

Its ridiculous because you don’t start by building a flipping hotel (with no regard to even the most minimal planetary protection) for super-rich tourists BEFORE scientists get a chance to examine the planet in any detail up close.  Why do we need to sacrifice programs to do Mars NOW?  Whats the burning national need?  We have Japan, Europe and Russia knocking on our door to work on the Moon, so we should prudently use that as a jumping off point for BEO spaceflight.

•Really? Beyond everyone's conceptualization? Are you that small-minded? SpaceX is hardly the first to propose systems capable of supporting more than a small handful of humans in space. As for why they aren't openly supporting NASA's efforts with the DSG or DSH, why should they? Has NASA asked? And your idea of NASA-SpaceX collaboration re: Mars is factually wrong. NASA will be getting techincal data from SpaceX if and when the latter is able to use supersonic retropropulsion to land on Mars, because NASA itself is very interested in said data.

I mean conceptualization as in nobody has attempted to build such a device before.  DSG is built around making it possible to understand how to do so, and its very difficult to keep ECLSS working on that scale.  Its not *impossible*, but it is very difficult and would be light years beyond anything fielded or seriously designed yet.  Talk to some ISS ECLSS engineers to find out the fun details of how hard it is to keep going, even if they had tons more money.  With the Red Dragon retropropulsion, keep your ears open, I think there may be some changes coming with that.  As for should they or shouldn't they, they can do whatever they damn well please, but they shouldn't pretend that their blind drive to Mars is ""helping everyone""


My idea of NASA-SpaceX collaboration *does* include that.  My idea is not “NASA does exactly SpaceX’s plan and then releases a colony to Musk.”  And if you think the US Government will happily allow them to build a libertopia, free of any jurisdiction uh well, perhaps *thats* a factually wrong concept.",True,False,0,1498878800,,False,0,djmszbz,t3_6jqdpp,t1_djltrkp,1499810318,3,False,EnoughMuskSpam,t5_3blr7,

This came from a researcher in Europe in the 1940's and '50's, who asked various zoos to send him wolves. He then penned them up together and watched how they reacted. This tells you a lot about what happens if you confine a bunch of randomly chosen unrelated wolves in a small area, but of course it tells you absolutely nothing at all about wolf packs in the wild.   

In reality it turns out male and female wolves ""mate for life"", or at least for years, and wolf pups typically stay with their parents for two or three years. So what people think are ""wolf packs"" are really just a wolf family - father and mother and their latest two or three years of litters. And the ""alpha wolf"" is simply the father.    

The ""alpha wolf"" misconception is particularly irritating because it's often used as justification for a domination style of dog training where the human has to prove he's the ""alpha dog"".

Enjoy the themes of black empowerment, social issues, self reflection and sort of looking over the rap game. What's so great is the conciseness of the album, 10 tracks with no weak links or lacklustre bars/production/anything. 4:44 is definitely the track I'm enjoying the most, you can feel how raw and emotional it is through the pain in his voice - ordinarily I don't ever feel emotional listening to music and I've never really grasped how people can start crying over songs but I did feel pretty emotional during that track tbh, especially after the last verse, which is one of the best on the album, about worries concerning when his kids will find out. 

Lyrics are great, laced with the double entendres that typifies Jay. Stuff like ""I said, ""Perhaps I Freudian slipped in European whips/ God sent me to break the chain"" or ""I still mourn this death, I apologize for all the stillborn /Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it"".

I'm finding it hard to say something negative about the album lol, obviously it being longer would be nice however that might take away from what's so good about the album.

Let's ignore the 10 million dead Congolese people in the Free Congo State, or about half the population at the time.  Let's ignore the genocides in German Africa.  Let's ignore the genocides in Algeria.   Let's ignore the apartheid states, which may I remind you last into the fucking 1990's.  Let's ignore the Rhodesian Bush War, the Congo Crisis, Angola War, the Algerian War (all in the 60's by the way).  Let's ignore the inherent destruction of vast swaths of human capital, institutional knowledge, and the extractive nature of colonisation in Africa.  Let's ignore the genocides that are directly linked to colonialism.  Let's ignore the very nature of colonialism was strongly resisted *at the time*, with Joseph Conrad's scathing criticism of his experiences in the Congo in *Heart of Darkness* where Kurtz was based on the very real monster Léon Rom, and the lobbying by Congo Reform Association and E. D. Morel.  Let's ignore the extractive institutions that exist now that are robbing Africa blind of their natural wealth.  

Let's look at the numbers, and see what they tell us.  



&gt;[These sets of institutions were very detrimental to investment
and economic progress. Which colonization strategy was adopted was, at least
in part, determined by the feasibility of European settlement. In places where Europeans
faced very high mortality rates, they could not go and settle, and they were more likely
29
to set up extractive states. Finally, we argue that these early institutions persisted to the
present. Determinants of whether Europeans could go and settle in the colonies, therefore,
have an important effect on institutions today. We exploit these differences as a source
of exogenous variation to estimate the influence of institutions on economic performance.](http://www.nber.org/papers/w7771.pdf)

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;[This paper has shown that there is a correlation between historically recorded conflict
in Africa between 1400 and 1700 and the more recent experience of civil conflict \(and
political violence\). This relationship is robust to exploiting between-country and
within-country variation as well as to including a wide variety of controls. Country
level attitudes also appear to have been influenced by conflict. We have also found
evidence that the regional pattern of development within countries is correlated with
the pattern of historical conflict. Hence the findings are consistent with the view that
historical conflict has both a political and economic legacy.](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/57125/1/Besley_Legacy%20of%20historical%20conflict_2016.pdf)

This is not a rebuttal or a justification for the current world order. 

&gt; percent of people in extreme poverty has dropped from 44%

Citation, please.

&gt;Poverty is dropping at the highest rate in human history.

Slaves in the 18th century were much more better off than their 16th century counterparts. That is not a justification for sweatshop exploitation and imposed miseries because of such a system. 

&gt;Yet you still believe that capitalism is holding people down. It is the only thing pulling people up

The human race is on the cusp of extinction level events because of capitalism's marriage to fossil fuel and animal agriculture industries destroying the environment through pollution, thereby endangering viability for human life on the planet. This relationship dependent on Capital's impetus for more will drag everyone and everything down. 

&gt;This is because of foreign investment and innovation in the poorest countries, not through government control. 

Capitalism is necessary to industrialize and modernize countries; no one here denies this. The other method to modernize and industrialize states is also to engage in central economic planning to quickly do so.

Furthermore, what will happen when those poor countries - exploited in the past through European-American imperialism - become wealthy enough to sustain a demand fairer wages, living standards, and access to their own resources? Usually what happens here in the US. 

The companies leave the country to go produce and exploit labor and resources in another impoverished state. Capitalism is dependent on desperate surplus labor and poverty to suppress costs and increase capital accumulation; Capitalism will never solve poverty or hunger because it is necessary for capitalism to function.

&gt;Micro finance investing in entrepreneurs in third world countries who offer services &amp; products to their communities spurring economic growth.

Never mind the [actual human costs and miseries imposed on those developing states](http://www.thedailybeast.com/lawsuit-your-candy-bar-was-made-by-child-slaves), nor the notion that those states will hardly be allowed to use their own resources at fairer costs and demands because [Western powers will inhibit such trends.](http://africasacountry.com/2013/03/who-killed-thomas-sankara/)

,Kellosian,,Research Scientist,"Once you play a few games you start to get a feel for what happens and you can start to anticipate it. The AI rarely goes to war without a focus, meaning that you can predict certain wars ahead of time. Here's a short list...

1. Italian War against Ethiopia. The game starts with this and Italy wins (unless Ethiopia is played by a player).  
2. Spanish Civil War. The Fascists fight the Communists and the Fascists usually win. If you're Communist or Fascist though, you can send volunteers if you have over 30 divisions (this war is early on though, so it's just Germany, Italy, and maybe Japan for Fascist and USSR for Communist). When you're playing as the USSR it's a good idea to try and win as it can give you a Communist friend on the far side of Europe.  
3. Japanese-Chinese War. Japanese AI is super shit at this war, so it can drag on for a long, long time. However they refuse to get help from the Axis until super late, if at all. This will keep Japan occupied... unless China gets a bad case of the stupids and loses quickly. On the other hand, if China wins then Japan is neutered and just camps on the home islands.  
4. German-Polish War. If Poland has formed their own faction this isn't a big deal; Germany swallows Poland and that's that. If Poland hasn't though, Poland might join the Allies and at this point WWII starts.  
5. German-French War. If Poland made their own faction *this* starts WWII.  
6. German-Dutch/Belgian/Luxembourgian War. This is Germany's ""Around Maginot"" focus. The Maginot Line is a giant-ass line of forts along the German-French border and it's a bitch to go through without losing millions of people... so Hitler just marched through the Benelux. This brings the Benelux into the Allies (although sometimes Luxembourg can fall so fast they don't join the Allies).  
7. German-Danish/Swedish/Norwegian War. Noticing a pattern yet? Germany usually goes to war with Scandinavia, which brings them into the Allies.  
8. German-Soviet War. This is the one that got you; both the USSR and Germany have focuses to go to war with each other so be on your toes about that. It's kind of a big deal because if Germany wins then they can basically steamrolls everything but the USSR isn't easy to conquer.  
9. Japanese-Soviet/Dutch War. This one is a choice; Japan has focuses to go to war with either, but not both. However it's ends up being both because Japan then joins the Axis, which drags them into war with the other.  
10. Japanese-American War. This brings the US into the war and they join the Allies, if they haven't already.

So as a general rule of thumb, don't help Germany unless you're in the Axis. From the Diplomacy screen you can also see who that country has war goals against - if it's you then *definitely* don't help. You major mistake was not attacking Germany while they were distracted; when they had troops in France you should have stabbed them in their ass.

Do you realize how stupid that sounds?  Do you even know when the smallpox vaccine was discovered? (spoiler alert, almost 300 years later).

&gt;While they may not have had our understanding of germ theory they certainly attempted to infect natives with smallpox

How? They didnt even know how it worked, let alone how to ""infect"" people. FFS, most devout people at the time thought it was the work of the devil. Are we still talking about 1500s Spain with the early Inquisition?

The smallpox killed everyone back then, and the spanish had no idea what it was, how it worked and how to cure it, so your foundations for the ""genocide"" using smallpox as a biological weapon are so ridiculous that even someone like your Alex Jones would think is too retarded.

In Central America and South America there were no ethnic cleanse and you showed no proof or any document that supports the contrary. The spanish mixed with the natives, and mestizos had very important roles in just a couple of generations ... try to explain that with your ethnic cleanse perpective of CentralAmerica and South America.

Your only base to say genocide is because 80% of pre-columbian population died in the first century of colonialism, then you call it a genocide without taking into account that it was the biological clash that killed them without the europeans wanting it.

That massive amount of deaths would have happened anyway. If Columbus hadnt been the first to land in America, those deaths would have happened 50 years later, 100 years later of whatever it took the next european to land in America. The biological clash was bound to happen and NOBODY at the time had the knowledge to understand it, let alone to prevent it.

&gt; regardless of how a single Queen over a 300 year history of colonial domination felt.

She didnt feel, she passed a law saying that the natives under spanish rule could not be enslaved.

&gt; Just because another colonial power or empire was ""more brutal"" that does not absolve Spain of it's large role in the destruction of the Amerindian peoples.

In any point I said that people didnt suffer in that era. If it that is what you understood then read again because I said that NOWHERE. What I said is that to blame spanish colonialism in CA and SA for a genocide is completely ridiculous.

They are mature people (probably more mature and sane than us when it comes to foreign policy). They can certainly work things out and probably do it more civilized without us involved.  

We did have a memorandum with Ukraine, but there were no specific responses outlined in it and no timetable.

The document stipulated we refer to the UN in case of disagreements, not go to war like our first action seems to always be. Also not to mention that we violated the Memorandum as well when we interfered and overthrew the Ukrainian government.  

You think its naive to not want to go to war in a country thousands of miles away. I think you are naive to think we can keep continuing with these ill advised and expensive conflicts around the globe that don't benefit us while our country and its people continue to get poorer and drown in debt.

A company also makes everything easier like buying land, properties...

,Diabetesh,,,"Here is a rundown of some of the larger ammunition names in the world that you may see on your shelf. Smaller specialty type companies like G2 research and Buffalo Bore will not be brought up in the bulk of this.

Fair warning, any company can have problems but most of these have been known to have relatively few problems in their history.

The world of new manufactured ammo on the American side you have only a few main companies. Federal, Remington, and Winchester. These guys are kind of the main force of American ammo production and have been around for a long time. They've also been suppliers of the US Armed Forces as well as most law enforcement within the US. Remington and Winchester are standalone brands and don't have any subsidiaries to work with while Federal has themselves, American Eagle, CCI, Blazer, Speer, Blazer brass, Fusion, Estate, and Lake City. One brand within the federal subsidiaries is Independence which is typically an Israeli made ammo. Each of those brands you can confidently say are good, new brass made (with the exception of Blazer), and that you will have relatively zero problems with whichever one you use. Hornady is also an incredibly good ammo company when it comes to hunting, match,  and defensive choices but they don't really have a solid grasp on target plinking ammo. Sig Sauer in recent years has started making ammunition and all signs point to good as of now but I don't want to jump the gun as they haven't been around as long. 

In Central and South America there are only two companies worth mentioning, Aguila and  Magtech. Aguila is a Mexican Ammunition plant that makes fairly affordable new brass case ammo in most of the major calibers. They are most known for their 22 ammo which has a pretty large variety of styles and bullet weights that uses the Eley priming system. Magtech is a Brazilian company that is likely the largest ammunition maker in the world next to Federal/Lake City. One really cool thing about Magtech​ ammo production is they have a very nice supply of cowboy action loads as well as low production cartridges like 32 S&amp;W, 32 S&amp;W long, 38 S&amp;W, and 4440 to name a few.  

In Europe some of the more notable companies for ammo production are Sellier and Bellot (czech), Geco/Ruag (german, hungarian, austrian, swiss), fiocchi/perfecta (eyetalian), PPU (Prvi Partizan - serbian), and Tula/Wolf/Bear Companies (Russian steel case ammo). While each of these companies supplies in their local/surrounding markets much of their production will cater toward the United States as we are a huge client. They will also typically make products that are more common for the European market but still makes its way here and ends up supplying the smaller percentages of gun owners who have these odds and ends rifles and handguns. PPU for example makes a lot of the European military cartridges like 303 British, 765 Argentine, 8mm Mauser, 65 Carcano, Etc in both soft point and FMJ brass case. The only downside of some of these companies is the brass is not necessarily the best reloading brass. Fair amount of people say the primer Pockets only reload a couple times before they are too loose to hold the primers.  

On the Asian continents the only company notable is PMC which is made in Korea. Most of their ammunition is similar to the American-made stuff in calibers likely due to America's alliance with Korea.  

This should give you a pretty good list of good ammo companies that make new manufactured brass cased ammo. Realistically there aren't a lot of bad choices out there in new manufacturing. About the only companies that I don't recommend to anyone whether a customer or someone on reddit are the steel case manufacturers (wolf, tula, bears) and the remanufacture companies AKA reloads. Steel case can be okay but typically I would recommend grabbing a box or two and trying it before you buy a whole case of it. Usually your gun either likes it or doesn't like it and you can't really do much to make it like it. The reason why I don't recommend remanufacturer and a decent amount of people Reddit don't recommend it is these companies tend to have higher rates of quality control issues than new manufactured only companies. What that means is you'll see periodic posts about companies such as Freedom Munitions and how a squib or an over-pressured round blew up someone's gun with comments saying well of course and others comments saying well I've never had a problem out of the 50 kajillion rounds that I've shot of it. More or less if you're going to buy reloads just don't buy it from the guy at the gun show who selling it in a ziplock bag because when shit hits the fan he's not going to have any sort of liability insurance to cover you if you get hurt. Freedom has had a pretty decent history of covering people when their guns are broken but they have a consistent enough history of it occurring that is why people don't recommend them as much anymore. On the topic of Freedom they also have a new manufactured ammo line which is still not recommended because the only difference between that line and the reloaded line is new brass and used brass. It is the same people making it, which means same QC.  

That all being said you just have to experiment with what brands you like, what your guns like, and what you're willing to pay and not willing to pay. You can be confident that most of the choices on this list will be good and safe regardless of what someone else thinks. In the end the most important thing is that the ammo works safely and reliably. You can have the most deadly or accurate projectile in the world but if it doesn't work in your gun reliably it won't matter.  

Hope this helps and sorry that it is long.  

Edit: I want to add some additional points. With steel case ammo the reason why it is not recommended by some is steel expansion properties at different than brass and sometimes will cause the case to stick in your chamber which holds up things and kind of ruins the moment/day.  

When it comes to FMJ ammo, which is your plinking ammo, FMJ is FMJ regardless of who is making it for the most part.  

When it comes to match ammo the few names of that list to make note of our federal, Hornady, and PPU.  

When it comes to defensive ammo most of them are close enough within each other it doesn't matter who you get but it is important that you get something that is reliable. For example, Remington golden saber can have a more open hollow point which in some handguns can have trouble feeding especially when they are on the smaller concealed carry size. Hornady critical defense ammo has a more narrow hollow point and a rubber or plastic tip which makes it feel more like an FMJ. When it comes to their differences in stopping power from 3 feet to 15 yards it's going to be so little difference for the average criminal that the most important factor is reliability.

,Swimmer117,,,"Putin is former KGB/FGB. He is a product of the Russian Secret Police system stretching back to the 19th century. Okhrana, Cheka, NKVD, KGB, FGB. All the same, just different names and new management. As my professor in college put it, the Russian secret police was the tail that wagged the dog of the Russian state. 
My guess? Putin is using his training in espionage and subversion to undermine the enemies of the Russian state and operate in ways that benefit himself. He started with successfully putting down the Chechens in the 2000s. Then worked his way to undermining Kiev and tying the economies of Central Asia to Russia (creating buffers between Russia and Europe/EU/NATO in the former). Support for Assad is most likely a ploy to ensure stability and offset American interests in the region (as well as put pressure on Erdogan). The Kiev Revolution of 2013 was to oust his man in power there. When that happened and Western Ukraine made overtures to the EU, Russia needed two things: a buffer and a home port for the Black Seas fleet. Enter the plebiscite of Crimea, the autonomous region made up of ethnic Russians (and a historic bone of contention between Kiev and Moscow since the 1950s and was originally resolved in the 90s when Ukraine left. Basically, Ukraine had to respect the autonomy of Crimea.)  To go even further, the eastern half of Ukraine is more aligned with Moscow than Kiev and they see themselves as more ethnically Russian than Ukrainian. The factional infighting in Kiev plus the inaction of the West to aid the revolutionaries helped Putin greatly. He was able to use it as a reason to not rely upon the EU for help.  
My guess as to this? Putin took a page out of our book. Subvert a democratic system by backing someone favorable to you. Use whatever means are available to keep the flunky in line. If he gets uppity, you throw him to the wolves with cut shins. 
Putin is probably out to bring Russia out of the wilderness back back on top as a great power and world mover. The efforts of the West to stifle this and keep them down (especially here where it's not New Russia but Soviet Union 2.0) have played into his hand. He can use it as a reason to keep himself in power because he wants what's best for the country. Our best chance to have undercut Putin was thrown away when we didn't embrace New Russia. 
As for the sanctions, don't make me laugh. Russia sits on a number of the worlds largest deposits of natural resources. Plus why would Russia need the West when it has China on its border. Anything they can't make, they'll get from there. Plus the sanctions play into Putin's hand, again. 

Again, this is speculation. I may be right, though I'm probably not. I've never met the man nor have I talked with him or read any private files on him or from the KGB archives. If I wanted to, I'd need a time machine. My best source is my major professor who did get the chance to go to those archives before they were closed off for the vast majority of people. All I can do is guess based on historical evidence, precedent, and ""quid bono?"" as my first question.

I wrote a reply to you the other day explaining some of the details, but you dont seem to have caught it. So I'm going to repost it here with the quotes from a previous post of yours.



&gt;I mean that the area of Narure 2000 was established because of the birds.

Yes but only partially.
There are two natura 2000 sites covering BPF. One protects birds (a product of the EU birds directive). And one protects habitats and species (a product of the habitats directive). Consequently, Natura 2000 sites protect all different types of biodiversity within BPF.

&gt;trees that were planted artificially by humans. 

Its a common misconception that the area outside of the reserves and national park is planted - people seem to assume this simply because its a 'managed forest' - and its a point that LP don't tend to correct as it suits their narrative. In fact, only 50% of it is planted. The rest is either old growth or secondary growth - far more natural that most people are aware of. Here is a quote from a publication:

In fact,  'According to the last inventory, stands 100 years and older (i.e., stands that had not been planted) covered some 20% of managed forest in the Polish section in 2001 (Fig. 2). Additionally more than 30% of the area is covered by secondary 70- to 90-year-old stands that regenerated spontaneously from old clear cuts. The rest has been transformed into secondary planted stands'

Source (a 2005 paper - it may seem a bit old but not much has changed since). Its behind a paywall but you could access it via scihub: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00265.x/full

&gt;but then it's not really that unique and irreplecable as the actual primeval forest.

So in light of the above, the reality is actually far more complex. Much of the 'managed area' is either primeval, or quite primeval - and it is all within the most recent logging plans.

&gt;I was trying.

Here is a map of the different zones. As you can see, the UNESCO management plan excludes the vast majority of the forest from use (i.e. logging is categorically not allowed).

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NVdqjsRqSe4/U6ku5o2FT1I/AAAAAAAAIMM/P-iEurkN7PI/s1600/unesco_strefy_och2+(1).jpg

&gt;but the question here was if INESCO really can or is restricting logging in that area and if so then why was it foinf on since... always?

The whole forest has only been on the UNESCO list since 2014 and up till recently there hasn't been any reason to complain. The UNESCO management plan mutually agreed with the Polish government was in place, much restricting logging across the whole forest. Now this management plan is being ignored, they have started to complain. In any case i dont think Poland has any legal obligations deriving from this - just negative press if it BPF is labelled as a 'heritage site in danger' next month.

&gt;Same goes for the objections of EC, why now?

Now here it get quite interesting. The EC has consistently voiced concerns, ever since Poland joined the EU. Thus a compromise was reached (so that the locals have some jobs and wood etc) in 2012 where the logging quota was cut to a third of its previous levels, and various areas of the forest were excluded from management. This includes all old growth (primeval) stands in BPF, including in the so-called managed forest. Some correspondence in the following link:

http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/commissions/peti/communication/2012/402615/PETI_CM(2012)402615_EN.pdf

After this agreement was reached, LP went and proceeded to consume the entirety of this 10 year quota within 3 years. And now the Environment ministry has, without consulting the EC, given permission for the quota to be trebled. 

In any case Natura 2000 obligations are legally binding, and so the EC is now likely to send Poland to the ECJ for violating these obligations.

So yeah, the situation's quite complicated. The main take home point is that much of what LP and the current environment ministry call the 'managed' part of the forest is in fact primeval or partially primeval (natural secondary growth) and excluded from forestry management according to the UNESCO and Natura 2000 plans.

,pseudea,,,"&gt;Segundo o Centro de Controle e Prevenção de Doenças dos Estados Unidos, com estatísticas do FBI, houve mais mortes por quedas de bicicleta no país (800 mortes) num único ano, 2010, do que por tiroteios em massa (418 mortes) ao longo de 13 anos (2000-2013).  

e a pesquisa é sobre crime violento, não tiroteios em massa. o mesmo autor fala sobre tiroteios em massa [aqui](https://law.stanford.edu/2015/10/12/professor-john-donohue-facts-do-not-support-claim-that-guns-make-us-safer/).

&gt;Há um número estimado de 515.000 atendimentos anuais de urgência devido a acidentes de bicicleta na terra do Tio Sam - e ele é sete vezes maior que as emergências não-fatais registradas de pessoas baleadas.

por que não conta emergências fatais? mesmo se contasse não duvido que tenha mais acidente com bike do que com armas.

&gt; Também em 2010, houve 26.009 mortes por quedas nos Estados Unidos (quedas de escadas, balcões, telhados, montanhas, etc) e 3.536 afogamentos fatais não intencionais (desconsiderando acidentes com barcos), o que dá uma média de dez pessoas morrendo afogadas em piscinas todos os dias (número quase 120 vezes maior que o de mortes por tiroteios em massa).

mais uma vez tiroteios em massa. não entendi a fixação com quedas e ainda não sei o que tem a ver. quer que eu pergunte se devem proibir piscinas e escadas?

&gt; No mesmo ano, houve 32.999 mortes por acidentes de carro e 11.078 homicídios. Comparado com 1993, houve uma queda de 49% de homicídios com armas de fogo nos Estados Unidos e de 75% de crimes violentos com armas de fogo (como assaltos, roubos e crimes sexuais). Isso quer dizer que durante esse tempo o número de armas de fogo disponíveis para a população diminuiu, certo? Errado. Aumentou em 56%. Os americanos nunca estiveram armados como hoje. Também nunca foram tão seguros.

isso tá a um passo de dizer que estão mais seguros porque estão mais armados, tem muitos outros fatores e é por isso que fazem pesquisas complicadas, olhar pros números e apontar correlação não é o melhor método.

[também](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/05/guns-in-the-united-states-one-for-every-man-woman-and-child-and-then-some/?utm_term=.f062da081055): ""*It's important to note that even as the number of guns has increased since the early-to-mid-90s, the per-capita gun homicide rate has fallen by nearly half over the same time period. On the other hand, it's also true that when you make comparisons between states and countries, you see that places with more guns have more gun homicides, as research from the [Harvard School of Public Health](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/) shows.*

*These two seemingly unreconcilable facts form the factual basis for much of the contemporary gun policy debate. Defenders of gun rights can point to falling homicide rates and rising gun numbers and argue that the solution to gun violence is more guns. Gun control advocates, meanwhile, can point out the correlations between gun ownership and gun crime and push for tighter restrictions on gun ownership""*

&gt;O que dizer disso tudo? Que não há qualquer correlação que implique que o aumento de armas disponíveis para uma população gere aumento do número de vítimas de armas de fogo no país, como é tão alardeado a respeito dos Estados Unidos. Tampouco que criar barreiras para o uso de bicicletas e de piscinas seja preciso para conter tantas vidas perdidas.

1: essa não é a conclusão correta, tem outros fatores.

2: acredito que existem barreiras para o uso de bicicletas e piscinas que salvam vidas mas mesmo assim é diferente. as pessoas usam bicicletas para se locomover, sabendo dos riscos. já armas são usadas para se defender ou ter a sensação de segurança, e o autor da pesquisa argumenta que as pessoas não pensam nos riscos: ""*For most Americans, said Donohue, carrying a gun to avoid a criminal attack is similar to thinking that having a weekly brain scan will save your life, without considering the potential hazardous effects.*

*“If we gave 300 million people a brain scan, we would save a certain number of lives,” Donohue said. “But you wouldn’t want to advocate that treatment without considering how many lives would be lost by exposing so many to radiation damage.  One needs to consider both the costs and benefits of any treatment or policy.  If the net effect of more gun carrying is that violent crime is elevated, then RTC laws seem much less appealing. This paper may have an impact in making people think differently about these issues.”*

&gt;Levantar esses pontos, no entanto, não é lutar por uma sociedade armada até os dentes, com todo mundo atirando por aí, armas de fogo disponíveis em qualquer boteco e um clima constante de olho por olho e dente por dente - como julga o esteriótipo raso que compõe a luta contra o direito à legítima defesa.

que bom.

&gt; Vai um pouco além. Serve para mostrar como a desinformação colabora para construir um exército de milhões de pessoas reféns de um constante sensacionalismo desarmamentista barato da imprensa.

I've ordered drug from ebay before, and yes it also not allowed to buy drugs from ebay here (europe), but the price difference was just crazy, so I thought to myself, fuck it. The drugs arrive safely no question asked. 

when I asked the seller, they've sent quite a huge amount of drugs this way and have so little problems, I guess the seller know how to wrap the drugs, write the description etc so it won't get into trouble. but to be fair, according to some forums here, you could got into trouble and end up paying fines.

btw, I'm talking about the applied drugs, as opposed to the oral one. the oral one probably harder to buy from abroad (and I'm not keen on eating drugs bought from ebay). I'm off oral drugs anyway, too scared of the side effects. quick question, are you taking oral too?

This is a common argument that is fundamentally flawed. If you want to know what a religion actually is you have to look at the source (for example the Bible or Quran), not the people.

The Bible/Quran are ancient texts that describe everything about the religion: what you need to do, how to live your life, how to get to heaven/paradise, etc. There are many good bits about loving your neighbor and stuff like that. There are also many horrendous and inhumane things, like how to treat your slaves (or sex slaves in Quran) when you should stone someone to death, etc. You cannot disagree with any of this because it's in the texts. Read them. 

1000 years ago people were able to follow all these rules because civilization was brutal. It was probably normal to stone people to death. In Europe the guillotine regularly chopped people's heads off in public. These people were Christians/Catholics following the Bible, and Muslims following the Quran. Back then people were able to follow the rules of their religion more closely.

Now, people must ignore those horrible parts of the Bible/Quran because we live in an increasingly secular and modern society. No more slaves, no more witch trials, no more stoning people (except in some cases in the Middle East). Guess who is not ignoring those parts of the texts. ISIS. The tragedies they commit come directly from that book. Their whole life is dictated by that book (Not just ISIS but many Muslims).

Therefore, you cannot say ""the majority of Muslims don't blow themselves up so that means ISIS are not really Muslims."" They all follow the same book, but these two groups of people are taking different actions.

,PLArealtalk,,,"Okay, first of all you should probably look at some European frigates and destroyers because their tonnage to VLS tube ratio is significantly higher than anyone else. Or even look at the Hobart class, which has a similar displacement to the 052D yet which has a lower VLS count.

Secondly, the reason for some warships having ""less"" VLS per ton, is because a warship is a function of many things beyond merely armament. Sensors, power generation, combat management, large size for growth potential, and even enhanced crew facilities which helps increase the effective endurance of a ship, all add tonnage to a ship without increasing the VLS. For example, look at how the Burke class has evolved from Flight I to Flight III -- their VLS load has remained effectively static despite the tonnage increasing with each flight. That's because each flight adds new non-armament improvements to the ship class which in turn adds tonnage. Putting it simply, seeking a low tonnage to VLS ratio is not the end all and be all for a ship, and it is incorrect and overly simplistic to assume that surface combatants should abide to some linear tonnage to VLS count ratio. Otherwise, you should expect a (for example) 2,000 ton ship to have something like 27 VLS (2,000 tons divided by 73.8) and any ship which doesn't would be considered underarmed. Hell you could even say the Flight III Burke, which displaces 10,000 tons (400 more than the Tico!) should have 135 VLS, but in reality it will only have 96 VLS which is the same number as Flight IIA Burke, therefore Flight III Burke is also technically underarmed using your logic. Of course this misses the fact that Flight III Burke will offer a multitude of other advantages over the legacy Tico class which was built with different requirements and technologies in mind.

Lastly, the Chinese Navy's universal VLS on 052D and 055 is significantly larger than that of the Mk-41 VLS. The CN VLS each has a diameter of 0.85m which is greater than even that of the Mk-57 VLS let alone that of the Mk-41, allowing each VLS to carry a larger equivalent missile. That does play a likely role in why an equivalent sized Chinese Navy vessel may carry VLS than an equivalent sized foreign vessel which carries Mk-41 VLS.

These are all relevant points to your question, but given the nature of your question I think the second point is most pertinent, which I will repeat, is that the tonnage to VLS tube ratio is not a linear one that can be applied to all warships of differing sizes, and also that any ship's tonnage to VLS ratio is a reflection of the role that each ship is meant to play in the navy that designed them and the era of doctrine they were designed for.

Going back to the 052D, frankly I'm surprised that you think it's underarmed considering it is a 7,000 ton ship (wikipedia's estimate of 052D's full displacement is almost certainly an overestimate) with 64 VLS, whereas there are similar sized ships like Hobart and Saschen class with less VLS or even bigger ships like Type 45 with less VLS. That isn't to say those ships are underarmed of course, it just means they emphasize different balance of use of tonnage compared to 052D.

And as for 055, again, a 112-128 VLS count for a ship displacing nearly 13,000 tons full might seem low compared to Tico or Sejong which displace 3000 tons less and 2000 tons less respectively and which have a similar or slightly greater number of VLS, but then you need to think about what 055 is using those extra 3000 tons or 2000 tons for. It doesn't take much imagination to consider they're probably allocated to for things like sensors, power generation, combat management command/control, or automation, crew facilities, growth potential, so on and so forth. 

Finally, let's use another example, like the Atago class destroyer which has a similar VLS count to a Flight IIA Burke and a similar configuration. However, Atago displaces 10,000 tons full while Flight IIA Burke displaces 9,200 tons full. Both of these ships are of the same effective generation, with similar armament, similar sensors, similar configuration, yet Atago displaces a whole 800 tons more. Where do you think that extra tonnage has gone to? Is it being wasted? Of course not. It's because the JMSDF designed the Atago class with certain other capabilities and facilities which Flight IIA Burke doesn't have due to the JMSDF's own requirements. Now, considering those two similar ships with such similar armament (in both type and number), similar sensor fit, similar configuration, and similar generation can have a different displacement like this, should it really be surprising to think that the 052D and 055 which are both ships from another navy with a vastly different set of armament (in both number and type), different sensor fit, different configuration, and in the 055's case being a different generation of design and doctrine, may have a significantly different allocation of tonnage? It really shouldn't be a stretch of the imagination, and if anything such a difference should be expected and be considered entirely normal.

###Introduction
***

&amp;nbsp;

The Deloitte Football Money League profiles the highest earning clubs in the world’s most popular sport and is the most contemporary and reliable analysis of the clubs’ relative financial performance. There are a number of metrics, both financial and non-financial, that can be used to compare clubs, including attendance, worldwide fan base, broadcast audience and on-pitch success. In the Money League we focus on clubs’ ability to generate revenue from matchday (including ticket and corporate hospitality sales), broadcast rights (including distributions from participation in domestic leagues, cups and European club competitions) and commercial sources (including sponsorship,merchandising, stadium tours and other commercial operations), and rank them on that basis.

Read the [**full report**](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Consumer-Business/gx-consumer-business-sport-football-money-league-2017.pdf) in PDF here. There are some nice infographics for each of the top 20 clubs.

I'm an international relations/political science major. I don't recall seeing any grad programs that were in English and less than 2 years anywhere in Germany.
&gt; 

Maybe I should elaborate:

The best german universities are the public ones where you get your education for free. And in terms of public universities one can't really go wrong with whatever school one chooses. There are some schools that are known to be among the best in Germany (RWTH Aachen for engineering, TU Munich, LMU, TU Dresden, Free University and Humboldt Unversity in Berlin, University of Cologne for Business etc.pp.) but there's not really any public schools that one should avoid because their education is bad.

In contrast, most private universities are shit, there are a few exceptions though. I know that the private university in Vallendar is one of the best for Management and Business for example.

Now if the one that you chose is good or bad, you should probably know better than me if you did your research. ;)

On the terms of your requirements (english program, one year) I can obviously not comment as I don't know the programs around Germany. In physics basically all masters programs are fully in english, might be different for political science/international relations though (the humanities are much less international than the sciences after all).",True,False,0,1498909058,,False,0,djn5vtz,t3_6klkfn,t1_djn5mvr,1499816658,7,False,germany,t5_2qi4z,

Perfugas is a 2 day raiding guild on silvermoon that has reformed from our previous guild, The Lore. We still retain many of our members from the previous guild, but in a more condensed, focused way. This means we can welcome new members while also retaining our core older members, some who have vanilla experience.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Currently we are recruiting people to push Mythic progression within Tomb of Sargeras. There, we will try to push as high as we can for a two day a week raiding guild. Mainly for Achievements, and personal goals.  
Mainly we are in need of exceptional ranged DPS and 1 Healer preferably a Holy Priest or Holy Paladin.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Raiding times  
We raid on thursdays and mondays from 19.45 to 23.00. However, for initial progression into Tomb of Sargeras we're planning to add a supplementary day for the first 2-4 weeks on wednesdays (depending on success), to speed up our appraoch to mythic.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
What we want from raiders.  
* We expect a regular attendance to raids (we understand real life can and should take priority, but try your best, and plan ahead).   
* Research/simming of your class to optimise your stats/talents.   
* Aquire knowledge/tactics for bosses PRIOR to raid times.   
* and ofcourse to have fun!   
  &amp;nbsp;  
What you can expect from us.  
* Professionality in raids and on what we do.  
* A fair loot distribution (RCLootCouncil).  
* A fairly decent progression within current and upcomming raids.  
* To administer certain events to help out in gearing alts or doing high end mythic+.

,strangemister,ES-VC,Valencian Community (Spain),"Okay, not madness, relax, there are different kinds of people in this world. He might just like to defend the Independence of Catalonia, and that is fine, but he has violated the rules of this subreddit with his behavior in regard to obsesive posting and commenting as I've explained before.

I've just browsed through his user account again, he doesn't call anyone fascist or traitor apparently, so please, restrain yourself from doing those comments.

I'm also tired of _Independència!!!!_ 

My biggest problem with the movement (apart from the use of Spain as a scaprgoat) is that they want to become an independent country, okay, that is fair, but they need to explain how that state is going to be and what are the consequences of creating such a state, such as the potential refusal by Spain to allow them into the EU (I would be against that, on a personal note) and how they would need to react or other things. It's just a disaster for them and a for Spain (but to a lesser extent).

And also, everyone with a rational mind knows that 95% of the population in the case of Catalan Independence wouldn't give up their Spanish Citizenship, the 3rd best passport in the world for travelling, doing business and such (Spain internationally speaking is not a hated country) in favor of some ""catalan passport"" which wouldn't even allow an individual to work in Italy. That is why I feel like the independence movement is fake, it's just about emotions.

,Sir_Derpysquidz,,,"""Europe has the bill of cleaning up""

Lol. We've been cleaning up ever since you shit the bed in the 30's-40's. The only reason the West is as capable as it is today is due to reconstruction and the threat of the US (more specifically nukes) keeping the red army at bay after they destroyed/refused to recognize every government that wasn't a puppet east of Berlin.

Following that we went to Vietnam after the French just left their colonial state out to dry after WWII with no real infrastructure. Surprise! The country fell to civil war. It's sad that the Democratic government was as terrible as it was versus the government of ho chi min since in accordance with domino theory we (that includes Western Europe) were terrified of anything with the name communist and backed the wrong horse.

Following that we've had to fund Israel. A state the British randomly created without much thought (a common theme in the disolving of the colonial empires btw) following the war to try to feel good about themselves after the Holocaust. We have had the largest hand in keeping it alive and from immediately falling apart. This has now created an indefinite race/religious war in that small area of the middle East as post WWII and revealing the Holocaust an entirely different nationality of people moved into the area and partially displaced the local population.

Another fun thing was that the CIA funded and provided aid to groups in Afghanistan to prevent/slow the Soviet **invasion** of Afghanistan. Sadly, after finally driving the Soviets out, those same groups (primarily the mujhadeen) took power and later went on to form some of the basis for the Taliban and Al Queida. 

Eventually this act **to keep nations independent from foreign invasion** bit us in the ass as we became the targets of the same groups we helped fight for their freedom in the beginning. This lead to the beginning of what we now call radical Islamic terror in the middle East and abroad with the most notable event being the September 11th attacks on the US.

In 2001 we invaded Afghanistan to remove the Taliban from power and destroy the power base of the terrorists we were seeing globally. This has taken a long time (still going on) because we helped them fight a large power before and taught them /supplied them with effective means (huge fucking tunnel complexes in the mountains and guerilla warfare) of fighting a superior force.

We invaded Iraq (spell their name right please) in 2003 to try to debase further powers that were (debatably) funding the insurgents in Afghanistan with added pretexts of removing a terrible and oppressive dictator who had the potential to have WMDs. While only partly right we did set up a Democratic government and began helping the Iraqi people integrate multiple ethnic and religious groups into the government instead of just the minority Shia group that Hussein had in power. 

The issue was, that due to political turmoil and pressure back home we pulled out the majority of our support and advisors too early which lead to a power vacuum in the region as the new Iraqi government couldn't fill the shoes of regional power that it's predecessor could and then even began to discriminate within it's own government again. This lead to the foundation of an area in which ISIS could flourish and become what it did/is today.

But no, it's all the US's fault and we don't try to do anything besides hate and violence and knock shit over. It totally wasn't Europeans who started both world wars. The US didn't push for a less harsh treaty of Versailles (the root cause of the Nazis rise to power and by extension, WWII). We didn't step up and put your sorry assess back together afterwards. We haven't tried to clean up all the messes that European imperialism brought upon the world. This global US-centric hegemony isn't the most peaceful era in human history.

I wasn't really assigning blame, just pointing out that cuts weren't an option, they were a necessity.

That's not to say Labour were blameless. The treasury under Darling calculated the UK had been running a structural deficit of 7% of GDP before the recession. But that's not the point I was making. The fact that we had to cut massively is independent of the argument about why our deficit was so high (the second highest in the EU in real terms, behind only Greece (Ireland's deficit was higher, but included the Irish bank bailout, the UK figures exclude the bank bailout)).

&gt;Government since has cut spending too deeply and too quickly, and we're now seeing the result of that

The UK has been close to the top for growth, deficit reduction and growth in employment. We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the EU. Since 2010 the UK has undoubtedly been amongst the best performing economies in the EU.

We have certainly suffered as far as wage growth is concerned, but with the massive influx of workers from the EU, that's hardly unexpected.

He has a terminal illness,  infantile onset encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, causes severe muscle weakness, affect his ability to breath and also affects his brain. He can't move his limbs or breathe unaided. He can't keep his eyelids open. He is deaf and has epilepsy. 

There is no cure for his condition, however his parents have taken his case to the UK High Court, the Supreme Court, the court of appeal and the European Court of Human Rights in legal battles costing tens of thousands of pounds.

Why? Because they want to take him to America for experimental treatment that has no proven results. Everyone involved in his case has agreed that further treatment is futile. 

I don't know what his life expectancy might be but with the effects of his condition it might be short, and he'd need constant care and machinery to keep him alive. I can't imagine what his quality of life would be like. I don't know why anyone would want to force a person in his condition to continue to live, but people say ""a mum will try anything"". 

I doubt that those who make statements about a mothers love have considered the pressure his care places on the NHS, the cost of the legal battles to our health care services or the burden Charlie would be should he outlive his parents.

**Part 1**

&gt;If Roger Federer is seen by many as a secular saint, then his recent resurgence feels like a miracle. He is a 35-year-old male, playing the world’s most universal individual sport, and redefining it. The whole phenomenon is so improbable that it is unlikely to be repeated.

&gt;But why is Federer such an outlier? Perhaps because he represents the Platonic ideal of a tennis player. In other words, if you set out to build the perfect winning machine, you would come up with a 6ft 2in optimist with a single-handed backhand and a taste for bold experimentation.

**Physical**

&gt;Let’s think about assembling that tennis superman. Your first temptation might be to stretch him to John Isner dimensions, close to 7ft tall. That way, he could hold his serve for fun.

&gt;But there is a downside here. Stilt-legged players tend to have mobility issues. And silky movement is the No. 1 asset for a professional player: the base from which everything else flows.

&gt;The “Big Four” men, who range between 6ft 1in to 6ft 3in tall, have been consistently the best movers on tour for a decade now. And Federer is the finest of all.

&gt;The footwork specialist David Bailey has **identified 15 different movement patterns in tennis.** The average journeyman pro has mastered around half of these, Bailey says, **whereas Federer owns the full set.** In all probability, he can walk on water too. 

&gt;Speaking to the New York Times in 2009, **Bailey attributed Federer's versatility to his varied sporting background, which included football, ski-ing and basketball as well as tennis.**

&gt;**“Some tennis players are one-leg dominant,” explained the NYT reporter Greg Bishop, “which makes certain shots and portions of the court uncomfortable [but] that’s not the case as often with European players, who … move well with either leg, often from scurrying around soccer fields.”**

&gt;Yes, Federer has natural athleticism and co-ordination. But this is not just innate genius. As his physical trainer Pierre Paganini has pointed out, ballet “looks beautiful, harmonious, graceful … easy, but do we think ballerinas don’t work?” The rumour goes that Federer has asked Paganini not to publish any of their secret drills in a training manual until his career is over.

&gt;**“Roger just moves so much more smoothly than anyone else,” says the former British No. 1 Jo Durie. “You never see him take a jerky or inelegant step. And that’s why he has such incredible longevity. He was 34 years old before he had his first operation.”**

Cont'd.

The situation in ukraine is much more complex than you and most people think it is. To go to war there also has nothing to do with being the world police or even defending ukraine. What would we even be defending? Ukraine isn't even ukraine right now, they're in the middle of a civil war after a coup which suddenly put nato-leaning leaders in power. 

This was never about crimea. If russia wanted crimea they would have taken it a long time ago. What actually happened is that ukraine was effectively being annexed into the EU in 2013. But their leader pulled out of the EU agreement. Then a huge movement comes in suddenly and chases him out of the country, involving tons of people including mostly non ukrainians (and CIA were on the ground at the time too, not surprising). Then a civil war starts over this, with the EU backed people fighting the autonomous ukrainians and russian favorers. Russia steps in to stabilize things because there's a freaking civil war in their neighboring country and crimea (which were treated poorly as ukrainians and are like 90% russian) vote to join russia.

But what do we hear about this in the US and europe? We hear, ""RUSSIA INVADED UKRAINE THEY'RE EVIL WE HAVE TO SANCTION THEM"". It's ridiculous. Ukraine was pretty much a puppet state to russia, they had no reason to invade or annex anything. The US and EU were the aggressors here after we didn't get what we wanted (getting ukraine to sign the EUA agreement) and sent in fake protesters and militants under disguise to initiate a coup. 

Want evidence for this? Notice how the west refuses to acknowledge the crimean vote to join russia because they say that russia was occupying and forcing the vote. But they DO recognize the signing of the agreement to dismantling of the previous ukrainian government during the coup where they basically had no choice and were forced by the ""protesters"" and EU into regime change. The EU were there to recognize and participate in the signing but russia's official refused to sign.

So yeah. It's really not just a matter of russia wanting ukraine and taking it. There is much more going on here and the US and EU refuse to acknowledge their involvement. Russia wanted to keep their secret control of ukraine and the EU tried to steal secret control of ukraine. Now the EU/US controls the government and north/west of ukraine but the south and east still side with russia.

Muhammad Ahmad bin Abd Allah (Arabic: محمد أحمد ابن عبد الله; August 12, 1844 – June 22, 1885) was a religious leader of the Samaniyya order in Sudan who, on June 29, 1881, proclaimed himself the Mahdi, the messianic redeemer of the Islamic faith. His proclamation came during a period of widespread resentment among the Sudanese population towards the oppressive policies of the Turco-Egyptian rulers, and capitalized on the messianic beliefs popular among the various Sudanese religious sects of the time. More broadly, the Mahdiyya, as Muhammad Ahmad's movement was called, was influenced by earlier Mahdist movements in West Africa and other forms of Islamic revivalism that developed in reaction to the growing military and economic dominance of the European powers throughout the 19th century.

From his announcement of the Mahdiyya in June 1881 until the fall of Khartoum in January 1885, Muhammad Ahmad led a successful military campaign against the Turco-Egyptian government of the Sudan (known as the Turkiyah).

They had a coup in late 1970's. The rapid increase in crime coupled with restrictive gun laws led to a lot of people feeling they should not face jail if they use a gun defensively.

Democrats instead doubled down on gun control, thinking it could work. ~~And completely discredited themselves~~

Each time gun control was rolled back, pundits and media predicted blood in the streets, nothing of the sort happened. Crime continued falling, though to my knowledge no one ever established a clear cause-and-effect relationship between increase in civilians with guns and decreased crime. Thus, the argument that gun control is required fell apart, and now in the US practically no one supports the positions favored by elites in EU: no handguns allowed, CCW only for police, etc. 

This was repeated state after state. 

Meanwhile, the goal of gun control advocates was to make all handguns either illegal and make armed self-defense illegal too, like it used to be in Chicago or Washington D.C. 

So, what happened in the end was that self-defense won, and carrying guns and shooting them is on the rise. ",True,False,0,1498914860,,1498983465,0,djn8bxk,t3_6klt0b,t1_djn6l1a,1499817846,24,False,slatestarcodex,t5_30m6u,

,6apbisnom,,,"Heya, 

I ordered about 25 or 50 AL-LAD, think they were 150ug then, from Lysergi about two years ago to Western EU. Shipping time took roughly two weeks, maybe even one IIRC; I think that's what it says on the [site](https://lysergi.com/index.php/shipping), [Important part](http://imgur.com/a/93KZ6). I ordered 4-ho-met before too and something else but all good quality, same as SI's products, tabs had same print.

Only shit thing now though is that for Europe anyway sometime last year Lysergi started requiring signatures on delivery which  kinda sucks. That's why I used [gr8researchchemicals-eu](https://www.gr8researchchemicals-eu.com) for AL-LAD most recently cause foche.ch was on holidays. SI price thier lysergamides a lil high. I'm not sure if this would work in your country but in Ireland, say, if you're not at home when the delivery man comes, they leave a letter saying you missed your delivery and you go pick it up later at the main post office. I've done this with weed before. Might be different if it'sa courier though which it may be. Sorry that's an aside.

The quality is really good for the lysergamides anyway. I got the lysergamide starter pack that had 5 ea of AL-Lad(150ug), ETH-LAD(150ug) and 1P-LSD(100ug). It was all good quality. 1P-LSD is exactly the same as LSD. ETH-LAD shorter acting than LSD, tinny bit less headspace, more colours. AL-LAD same duration as ETH-LAD, almost no noticeable headspace, verrry colorful, most fun and my favourite by far. They have good sales on now and again and have really increased their stock; They even have 5-MeO-MiPT(Moxy) at 50 bean for 50 bang. i got a gram of moxy one time from chemical story and it feels like its never gonna run out.

No shipping to UK now but you I guess they wouldn't have sent yours otherwise lol.

If ya spend less than €170 they through in two free 1P-LSD(100ug) to make up for the high shipping cost. They were down for a while and haven't used them in ages but the signature puts me off too much.

1. The passage of Andrew Lansley's healthcare bill (*Health and Social Care Act, 2012*). Utter trainwreck passed just for the sake of passing it. Wasteful, poorly thought out reform in an age of austerity. Really hammered home the importance of consultation and parliamentary scrutiny.

2. I come from a highly religious family who are otherwise economically left wing. Classic Blue Labour demographic if they knew what that concept meant. Consequently the passage of the *Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013* brought my hardcore social liberalism into conflict with theirs. Raised the contradictions of the Labour coalition for me, in a way I've not really resolved.

2. The treatment of Greece during the eurozone crisis. Perfect example of duplicitious behaviour by supposed pragmatists, who refused to see that the system they operated in was fundamentally toxic. Feeds into my general perspective that the Eurozone is a political monstrosity, and one of the key things that UK foreign policy must seek to balance.

3. The second leadership contest following the EU referendum. Though it was part of a longer arc, it really forced me to think about what being an ideological 'moderate' actually meant. Its often treated as a compromise position, but I think its more than that and desirable in its own right.

I've yet to experiment with ALD52 and 4ACO, but have tried 1P before from a German vendor. Was disappointed actually, very sober-like, non-trippy and very chemical.

They may not (yet) be the majority of german muslims, but change has to start somewhere, doesn't it?

They were muslim reformers for a very long time, and trusting that they will change things had failed so far.

&gt;Actually, yes, there was one incident where this happened

1 huge incident that come out, where many people from police, and government were involved.

&gt;but curiously, the numbers in general speak another language. Usually, migrants will be treated worse, getting beat up more often by the police, beeing prosecuted more often and beeing sentenced more often, it's called institutional racism and while the government denies this exists... it's quite obvious to everyone.[[1]]((http://www.dw.com/en/berlin-denies-institutional-racism-among-german-police/a-18571585))

Nonsense, it is the other way around, they avoid prosecuting muslims to prevent being accused of being racist.

""The German police, meanwhile, failed to catch the murderers in part because they consistently dismissed the possibility that they were far-right motivated, and instead sought non-existent links between the victims' relatives and Turkish organized crime.""

lol, because police is never wrong when they investigate death of a white person.

&gt;Those people weren't critizising immigration, they were inciting violence, they were calling out to kill people and burn down homes. This has always been punishable by law in germany since WWII and is nothing new.

Prove? https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/germany-springs-to-action-over-hate-speech-against-migrants/2016/01/06/6031218e-b315-11e5-8abc-d09392edc612_story.html?utm_term=.e200d0c34fba

""In September, the home of a 26-year-old Berlin man was raided by police, who confiscated his computer and phones after he had posted the tragic image of the dead 3-year-old Syrian boy whose body on a Turkish beach became a symbol of the refugee crisis. Along with the photo, he had posted: “We are not mourning, we are celebrating!”""

I don't see any threat here.

&gt;Volksverhetzung, in English ""incitement of the masses"", ""instigation of the people"" (the official English translation of the German Criminal Code uses ""incitement to hatred""), is a concept in German criminal law that refers to incitement to hatred against segments of the population and refers to calls for violent or arbitrary measures against them, including assaults against the human dignity of others by insulting, maliciously maligning, or defaming segments of the population.

In other words any criticism can be a hate speech.

&gt;I hope this explains a little, why none of the arguments you brought up can shatter my optimism when it comes to germany finding a way to draw red lines we will not allow to be crossed by conservative muslims and also red lines we will not allow to be crossed by the right.

With current ignorant population, and politicians you will become Islamic theocracy. You had created Nazist ideology, and now you help to spread Islamic ideology, your methods had changed, but the problems that you cause are the same.

&gt;But in the end there will be a level-headed compromise between a majority that wants to preserve its way of life but struggles with the new and different of the foreigner on one side.

To save me outlining much the same again, I've copied from a previous reply:

We cannot have SM membership and respect the result of the referendum at the same time. That vote represented regaining control over our laws and our own immigration. To be in the Single Market as members (members of the EEA) we have to agree to accept freedom of movement and imposition of EU law.
We can have tariff free access to the market and customs union by way of trade agreements theoretically without having to accept The EU Court of Justice or full FoM. This is the line Corbyn is taking so as to respect the wishes of the 52% but deliver as near as we have now as possible in terms of benefits of the EU. It is still classed as a soft brexit.

The hard brexit would be crashing out with no EU agreements in place, no tariff-free access to the market and no agreements on customs duties. Effectively crashing out on WTO rules that still have to be put forward to the EU anyway.

What Umunna was tabling by retaining membership would have meant not leaving the EU at all because the EU have already told us that as it is the decision of all member states to allow EEA membership without EU membership (they agreed this with Norway) and they won't allow us to. If we want SM membership it has to come with full EU membership.

The sixth-generation console is the successor to the Nintendo 64 and competed with Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox.

The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage medium. The discs are similar to the miniDVD format; as a result of their smaller size and the console's small disc compartment, the system was not designed to play standard DVDs or audio CDs.

I'd argue that it's actually the formerly communist countries who make the bulk of the lower cost labor today, I.e. Poland, China, Russia etc. Latin America for livestock.

Also in general this world view is based on *extreme* simplification and wishful thinking. Westerners want to believe they somehow hold a magical button that can halt China while discounting Eastern industrial power.

In reality there are many diffrent factors to trade, cost of production etc. I remeber reading that the American factory worker could expect to earn 1$ for every 0.89$ a Chinese worker did. Account for diffrent cost of living and you start to see why America has more homeless than China. 

Another point that is often overlooked is that almost all Eastern goods go back to their country of origin. Places like China have 50% world manufacturing capability not because they are being ""exploited"" by ""western"" firms, but because first world level populations are an incredible resource and goods sink and China is around 20% world population.

Something like 19% of Chinese GDP is from export, and that's to the whole world and not only the west. Majority of this is stuff that China itself has no use for like extra steel. The worldview that someone in the west somehow can push a button and stop China is naive and wishful thinking.

,Muskwatch,northamerica,Indigenous Languages of North America | Religious Culture,"Linguist here who works with several different First Nations communities. The conventions for translating or not translating names into English really have no rules beyond convenience and going with what goes.  As far as convenience is concerned, here's a few trends.

-- Nations with long polysynthetic meaningful names generally get their names translated.  The means that almost all Cree, Ojibwa, and Sioux names seem to get translated. Think Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake - Sitting Bull.

BUT! this doesn't seem to hold true since back in the earliest days of at least American history, many names from nations very closely related to these same nations **didn't** get translated. Powhatan, Pocahontas, etc. Possible (likely) differences include the fact that in the earlier times, Tribes like the Narraganset and such were considered valuable trading partners and also equally human, despite the serious differences, while during the later period of western expansion, there was a lot less respect and willingness to accommodate non-English names.

Jumping further to the Pacific Northwest, while many names *are* easily analyzable and translatable, there is a longstanding local tradition of generally *not* translating names as they are passed back and forth between language groups. Many people I know have names that are clearly from neighbouring or even more distant nations, and while they might change pronunciation, they aren't translated.  This is reflected in English usage where we refer to Chief Pootlass, Chief Maquinna, and so on.

The ""MEANINGFUL"" part is important as well - In Cree for example (and I think in Lakota/Dakota as well) all names are meaningful, meaning that they use the same morphemes as the rest of the language. So any name can be translated, and in fact it's fairly natural to translate when speaking, given that people don't draw strong distinctions between ""name language"" and ""normal language"".  In the language I'm working with now, Nuxalk, the Nuxalk root word dictionary includes several hundred names as separate entries, and it's very clear that many or most names are not immediately translatable, furthermore because of the suffixes available for creating names, multiple names exist with basically the same meaning, but pronounced different to distinguish people, so you can't simply translate all their names or you end up with a lot of confusion.

Another impact in this later period is the prevalence of residential type schools, and how common it was to give people ""Christian"" names, so often when people wanted to use an easy to say name, they'd go with ""John"" or ""Herb"" and so on.

This same trend played out on the prairies of Canada, where many First Nations had some European bloodlines in them, and if people needed to they could fall back on a European name to make things go smoother, and were often known by both. Many in my family had both Cree names and English names, but when one of them signed treaty six, he signed with his Cree name.

Another obvious factor is pronunciation.  Some languages have tones, pops, nasals, and sound just really difficult to an English ear.  So more likely to be changed.

Last factor I'll mention is the presence of trade languages or the medium of communication.  In the prairies, a LOT of First Nations had access to English or French speakers from hundreds of years of trading.  New people come, you can always explain your name.  Other areas used pidgins like Chinook Wawa or Mobilian Jargon, and nicknames were a common part of the playfulness that tended to result from using these languages. Names like Skookum John and such that sound mixed were often Pidgin nicknames.

So in conclusion, there are a lot of different reasons: linguistic reasons, political reasons, power reasons, or simply going to the preferences of whoever first wrote the name down or how the first meeting went.",True,False,0,1498921546,,False,0,djnc8vd,t3_6km3wi,t3_6km3wi,1499819764,1668,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,

The objective of the puzzle is to form a specific shape (given only an outline or silhouette) using all seven pieces, which may not overlap. It is reputed to have been invented in China during the Song Dynasty, and then carried over to Europe by trading ships in the early 19th century. It became very popular in Europe for a time then, and then again during World War I. It is one of the most popular dissection puzzles in the world.

I've checked out a couple of photos from Scotland and it looks very European indeed with the narrow streets and everything. You could create free parking lots and spaces and stuff like that so that the cars have more room to park. Maybe give the people that park on the lanes large fines or whatever to further stop the people from parking there. When that's done the cyclist will have more room and they'd feel safer which, again, means more people will use it (especially when you need to search for a parking spot every time you want to park your car). Would take years I suppose, but after a while the bikers become more of a thing and the cars will look out for them. 

I'm not an expert but it seems like your streets are indeed difficult if you want to add seperate bike lanes so I don't see that getting a place over there. I don't think Scotland will ever reach the same biking culture unfortunately, but there are a lot of things a government can do to increase its popularity like creating laws that project the cyclists (if a car hits a biker over here, the car is responsible 99% of the time) and the stuff that I mentioned earlier.",True,False,0,1498923006,,False,0,djnd96x,t3_6khbd3,t1_djn6emu,1499820252,1,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,

You made up claims without numbers and sources.

&gt; All you can point to is distasteful portions of American politics.

That is why I gave you links with actual data. Which is more than you ever did.

&gt;  Meanwhile, much of Europe lags in LGBT rights

Europe is not a country, and it is funny that you bring this up right after you complained about me allegedly only being able to point to distasteful portions of American politics. But here is a link for you:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_Europe

&gt; Currently 28 of the 50 countries and 8 of the 9[nb 1] dependent territories in Europe[nb 2] recognize some type of same-sex unions, among them most members of the European Union, 22 out of 28.

&gt; As of March 2017, thirteen European countries legally recognize and perform same-sex marriage, namely Belgium, Denmark,[nb 1] Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,[nb 3] Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.[nb 4]

And if you look at the dates when those countries started to allow gay marriage you will see that most of them allowed it **before** the USA.

Lastly, shall I bring up your prison system now or what? Or the fact that your president is in favor of torture and that Guantanamo is still not closed? What about the great travel ban that your president keeps pushing? What about healthcare? Massively growing inequality? Institutional racism? The state of your educational system which is now in the hands of a Christian nutter?  Etc etc.

&gt; (the supposed leader of the free world ROFL) 

That phrase was basically American bullshit propaganda that has now stopped serving you. Given that you guys had stuff like segregation and later then things like the patriot act and the biggest prison population on this planet it was always ridiculous to apply it to America.

&gt; and Germany just passed fascist free speech laws. 

They passed trashy laws against large media companies that are already curating their content, but just not in accordance to German laws. Meanwhile your country is becoming ever less free while *already* being less free than Germany to begin with:

Not to mention your issues with freedom of the press.

&gt;It isn’t just Africa or the Americas, Israel or Palestine, neither the colonial past nor a remnant of it in the post-colonial present. What is at stake here, as Spivak explains invoking Fanon and Djebar, is the colonial fantasy. It persists, “whether the imagined contact between races or peoples involves a perilous siege or easy pleasure”, as Woodhull says concurring with Spivak and Djebar’s analysis. And persist it does. Consider 6 October, 2015. During the Conservative Conference in Manchester, the UK Home Secretary, Theresa May, informed her audience that “too much or too fast immigration made a cohesive society impossible,” a statement confirmed on the same day by Prime Minister David Cameron. Next day, during his speech, Cameron condemned racial discrimination in the name of a commendable, British, multi-cultural society as “the best in the world.” One day, imagined contact between peoples is deemed perilous. Next day, as easy pleasure. The bodies and souls of feminized others, once the site of colonial warfare, have now become the “hearts and minds” to be weighed and won over, conquered, penetrated, in the war against terror, for security and the compromise between classes of the post-colonial Twenty-first century.


This has put into words something I've thought about a lot about. The way that the UK (and extensions thereof like Canada) and France regard the colonized people of their former empires is glaringly contradictory and supremely paternalistic. They're not individual people, they're recipients of the grand privilege of being allowed to come and try to make a living in the place that sucked the wealth out of their homeland, they're others to assimilated into Western European post-Christian liberal culture which is evidently supreme to their own, they're problems to be dealt with in various ways, but they're not individual people, they're a blob of others.",True,False,0,1498925492,,False,0,djnf0ud,t3_6km410,t3_6km410,1499821122,4,False,CriticalTheory,t5_2tmcb,
,tejmuk,,Critical pro-indy dissident. /r/ScotRef,"*Now the EU cannot weaken its Brexit opponent by driving a wedge between England and Scotland*

There is unlikely to be much of a legacy from Theresa May’s premiership, which could yet be truncated a short way into its second year. Yet one very good thing looks like coming out of it: the strengthening of the United Kingdom. The Union suddenly looks in better health than it has done for several years. Nicola Sturgeon did not quite scotch her dream of a second independence referendum this week, but in delaying the required legislation until the autumn of 2018 at the earliest she has bowed to the inevitable. She has been sent, as the Scottish national anthem says, homeward tae think again.

Meanwhile, the importance of Northern Ireland in Westminster has been enhanced. The deal between No. 10 and the DUP certainly looks like a grubby case of cash for votes, but it is also more explicit and honest than the kind of pork-barrel spending that is now routine in Westminster to soften up marginal constituencies. Many of those most critical of the deal with the DUP have spent the past few years denouncing ‘austerity’ and decrying the lack of investment in the provinces. The SNP seemed quite happy to lap up extra money offered to Scotland during the independence referendum.

The DUP’s leader in Westminster, Nigel Dodds, pointed out in the Commons this week that much of the opposition to the agreement is sheer hypocrisy. He even threatened to publish the correspondence between the DUP and Labour in 2010 and 2015, when the two parties discussed their own arrangements in the event of a hung parliament. Others, such as Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Greens, have championed the idea of parties working together — except, that is, when the parties in question fail to conform to her idea of a ‘progressive alliance’. Surely it is a good thing that for the first time in recent history we have a government which has representation in all four nations of the United Kingdom. The Union needs to be strong to help our Brexit negotiations. No longer will the EU be able to weaken its opponent by driving a wedge between England and Scotland, as Nicola Sturgeon had hoped. There will be no halfway house for one part of the United Kingdom. The deal which emerges will have to work in all parts of the country. The DUP has already made one useful contribution by ensuring a higher priority for keeping open the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.

The stronger the United Kingdom, the greater our leverage in Brexit negotiations and the stronger our position in the world afterwards. Part of the case for leaving was that the UK, as the world’s fifth largest economy, was big enough to demand its own bespoke deal with the EU on more favourable terms than those achieved by Norway and Switzerland. Moreover, the size of our economy serves to attract attention from nations outside Europe who want to forge alliances and bilateral trade deals with us. The threat of Scottish independence would weaken that advantage.

Two years ago, it seemed as if unionists had won the battle only to face the prospect of losing the war. The SNP’s near clean sweep of Scotland’s Westminster seats promoted a sense of inevitability about independence. Yet this political monoculture was short-lived, killed off before it could become established by the unexpected early election. No one can now present the Conservative and Unionist Party, to give it its full name, as an English party that is ruling Scotland from abroad. Indeed, were it not for the surge of support in Scottish Conservatism, Mrs May might not be Prime Minister at all.

With 13 Scottish seats in the Commons, the Scottish Conservatives cannot be ignored by Theresa May. Under Ruth Davidson’s inspiring leadership they have become a brand in themselves — at present a more successful one than the English version. One of Michael Gove’s first acts as Environment Secretary was to visit fishermen in his native Aberdeenshire and discuss their concerns about Brexit. His example ought to be followed: the Conservatives need to show in their everyday visits and consultations that the voice of Scots is being heard as loudly as the voice of Ulster.

The Prime Minister and her colleagues have no need to be apologetic about the deal with the DUP. On the contrary, they should make the most out of their poor election result by using it as an opportunity to command much broader national support — something the Conservatives allowed to slip away from the 1980s onwards.
Theresa May did not, of course, aim to put herself in this position. For her, the outcome of the election was a disaster that she, personally, inflicted. She will not be forgiven, by her party or country, for this misjudgment. Yet the unintended consequence, and something no one could have foreseen, is that the survival of the United Kingdom is looking more certain than it was a few weeks ago.

&gt; Last year, Francis confirmed there was a 2,000-case backlog, and he set about naming new officials in the congregation&amp;#039;s discipline section to process the overload. M&amp;uuml;ller&amp;#039;s handling of the abuse portfolio came under fire from Marie Collins, an Irish survivor of abuse.

&gt; The greater clash between M&amp;uuml;ller and the pope concerned Francis&amp;#039; divisive 2016 document on family life &amp;quot;The Joy of Love,&amp;quot; in which he used strategically placed footnotes to offer a cautious opening to letting divorced and civilly remarried Catholics receive communion.

&gt; Four conservative cardinals have led the charge attacking the pope&amp;#039;s document as vague and confusing and publicly requesting Francis clarify it.

When the US State Department listed the KLA as a terrorist organization in 1998, it noted its links to the heroin trade,[28] and a briefing paper for the US Congress stated: ""We would be remiss to dismiss allegations that between 30 and 50 percent of the KLA's money comes from drugs.""[29] By 1999, Western intelligence agencies estimated that over $250m of narcotics money had found its way into KLA coffers.[30] After the NATO bombing of 1999, KLA-linked heroin traffickers again began using Kosovo as a major supply route; in 2000, an estimated 80% of Europe's heroin supply was controlled by Kosovar Albanians.[31]

For the first scenario, western countries do not have the cohesion to act as one. EU just stopped Macron's plans to shut out China and the AIIB fiasco for the US shows how loyal their European allies are. 

The ""Gordon Chang"" clique is just one part of the China ""experts"", there are some who think it will fall every second year and there are some who think China is the greatest thing since sliced bread. The important part is that China is growing fast. 

Creating a color revolution isn't a special ability granted to the west. Color revolutions arise when confidence in govt is low and the people is unsatisfied. None of this is true for China, in fact the people are quite nationalist. 

In fact it is the west with it's divisive ""white nationalists"", ""zionists"" and ""black power"" groups who is susceptible to Chinese or Russian manipulation (which might have happened already).

For the second scenario Asia maintains advanced medicine and it's hard to just smuggle in biological weapons and being found out = death sentence for the instigating nation. They'd be shunned by other nations and may be counterattacked by the victim nation. 

There is no proof any western country has an advanced biological weapons program which can threaten eastern nations. Even if they possessed it, the nature of such a weapon (indiscriminate killing) means that it invites nuclear counter strike if enough civilians die. 

With how deep China is in the US intelligence, they would probably be aware of any attempt to create biological weapons and raise hell about it to turn the US into a pariah nation which is what they want.

but even i, who sat in the forefront of this racial issue that most would consider 'normal' wouldn't have the audacity to put all the blame to the eeevil white europeans.

that's on us gooks, unfortunately. we're the one who are so deluded by our own past, that we think too highly of those white europeans.

and then comes all these bullshit about cultural appropriation. what the fuck.

the kardashians and the jenners are talentless hack, that is obvious. why are they rich? apparently because the matriarch married a rich lawyer and the protegé married a rich rapper. why are they famous? it's called this ""famous for being famous"" effect, as described by j boorstin in his 1961 book.

Jim Crow laws were state and local laws enforcing racial segregation in the Southern United States. Enacted after the Reconstruction period, these laws continued in force until 1965.

Moon derives from the Proto-Indo-European word that also gives us Month, referring to the month-ish cycle of its phases.  Luna and Selene, the Latin and Greek variants respectively, derive from PIE terms for light or illumination.

Although there is some variance, a large portion of human cultures associated the moon with a goddess or at least a feminine aspect due to the similarities between the lunar cycle and the menstrual cycle - the root word that gave us Moon can be spotted in ""menstrual"" as well.

Macron on the burkini:

&gt; “The burkini is not cultic. It is cultural, ideological, and political,” said Macron, who remains balanced on the issue. While **he believes that the burkini ban was justified in certain areas**, “so as to maintain public order”, and that the garment “is against civil beliefs of gender equality”, he was vehemently against the incident which saw French policeman order a woman to remove her burkini on a beach in Nice, following the terrorist attack. “To defend secularism in such a backwards manner runs the risk of alienating whole communities,” said Macron. **""It is vital to defend people’s individual freedom to wear what they like""**.

The bolded parts are *directly* in conflict with each other. You *cannot* ban women from wearing certain types of clothing *and* believe it is vital for women to wear whatever clothing they want. They are literal opposites.

Macron on bureacracy:

&gt; For Macron, the main obstacles in French society are the corporations, intermediary bodies and the political system, whose roles and functions all need to be re-investigated. “Having said that, **I am not the enemy of intermediary bodies.** They are necessary in structuring society”, he said. “Criticising them is what got me accused of populism like Marine Le Pen. **But if speaking to the people or saying that the intermediary bodies are no longer doing their jobs, if that makes me a populist, then so be it – I’ll be a populist!”**

So is he their enemy or not? Again, it's a direct contradiction: he says he is not the enemy of the intermediary bodies, and then immediately criticizes them.

Macron on the EU:

&gt; While Macron has said he is **neither Eurosceptic nor pro-Europe**...

I worked for a company which hired plenty of physicians in Zagreb and the salaries were way less than half of what a physician would get in the UK.

,Gongille,,,"Before heading to Strasbourg in the north of France for a business trip, I decided to spend a weekend in Paris. Whilst strolling along rue Tiquetonne, a street renowned for it's small boutiques, I stumbled across a watch store by the name of Chez Maman. 

They carried a variety of entry to mid range European brands such as Junghans, Junkers and Lip to name a few. The shop assistant, Violet, was very friendly and was more than happy to assist me in trying on a few Lip [pieces](http://imgur.com/Z7FApDN) that had caught my eye. 

I had read about the Mach 2000 on [Worn &amp; Wound](http://wornandwound.com/art-time-roger-tallon-lip-mach-2000-chronograph/) as well as [aBlogtoWatch](http://www.ablogtowatch.com/lip-mach-2000-dark-master-chronograph-x-watch-review-seventies-design-era-revival-fit-to-be-worn/), but I had yet to see it [in person](http://imgur.com/J1dpRxz), reissue or original. 

I was intrigued by the design and history behind the watch, but being a quartz reissue, it didn't ""talk to me"" enough to justify the 449 Euro price tag, so on I went with my day of touristy mumbo jumbo.

A few hours later, while passing by a quaint little neighbourhood adjacent to Luxembourg Garden, I did a double take when I noticed in the corner of my eye: a watch that looked like a Rolex, fully [submerged in a fish tank!](http://imgur.com/RNoDzGm)

Curiosity got the better of me; I was greeted as I entered by a polite young man who looked to be in his early twenties. I continued to look around, and just as I was having a gander at the Rolex cabinet, a sharply dressed, middle aged man asked me if I was looking for anything in particular. After he introduced himself as Antoine, the owner of the shop, we began talking, in particular about the [recent discovery](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-paul-newmans-legendary-rolex-cosmograph-daytona-was-foundand-where-its-going-now-1496322396) of *the* Paul Newman Daytona, which somehow led to me telling him about how I had seen the Lip Mach 2000 reissue for the first time just a few hours prior. Suddenly, I hear in a thick French accent, ""Please, one moment."" as Antoine disappeared behind a door, hidden by a row of watchmakers.

Not 2 minutes had passed, when he re-emerged with none other than an original 1975 [Lip Mach 2000 Chrono Ref. 43756](http://imgur.com/cLT1OQP) powered by a manual wound Valjoux 7734. As it turns out, he had purchased the piece from a customer a while ago, but hadn't had the time or shop space to put it on display.

As I tried it on, he commented on my Omega Speedmaster. We soon discovered we had a shared love for the original moon watch, and before you could say ""dot over ninety"", I was [trying on](http://imgur.com/oIKLDmG) his personal ""Base 1000"" Ed White!

One hour ago I was sitting in a little French corner cafe, pondering about my afternoon plans. Now, I had a watch on my wrist that I never imagined I'd handle. To put things into perspective, the bezel on that watch alone sold for [north of $16,000](http://speedmaster101.com/blog/base1000-bezel-sold-for-16200/), and that's in the rare event that one presents itself for sale. As a whole package, it would be rather difficult to price due to the rarity. There is no doubt that this piece would be the creme de la creme of even the most serious watch connoisseur's collection. I must have died and gone to the moon.

The next hour or so flew by, with Antoine reminiscing about his first *nice* watch, an Omega Speedmaster which he found in a sorry state, and repaired himself while he was an apprentice watchmaker. He then showed me [a few more](http://imgur.com/mn4m4tA) interesting pieces from his safe: [two more](http://imgur.com/7baz3X1) pre-moon Speedmasters, a 1950's [Blancpain Fifty Fathoms](http://imgur.com/PSDDSOy) and a [Ressence Type 3](http://imgur.com/Dujra9R). 

After our little geek out session, I tried the Mach 2000 on again, and felt a smile creep across my face. This outspoken little watch was full of personality, and embodied the playful spirit of Paris. After discussing the asking price Antoine was looking for, I decided to sleep on it.

To me, the most special watches are those which have a story behind them. The afternoon spent discussing my hobby with a man who was just as, if not by far more passionate that I about watches, and trying on multiple grails of mine was without a doubt one of the highlights of my time spent in Paris. Taking home an iconic piece of French watchmaking would bring my trip to a romantic, memorable end. 

Needless to say, I returned the next day with an offer, which Antoine accepted. We said our goodbyes, and wished each other all the best in our horological endeavours.

,JoaoLomar,,,"Boas pessoal,
Eu já venho ao reddit há muito tempo(cerca de 3 anos) mas nunca comentei nada por aqui se não estou em erro. Só criei conta há pouco tempo porque nunca senti a necessidade. Vinha aqui nas aulas para me atualizar e rir um pouco.
Mas indo ao que interessa, 
Eu já participei na Academia Olá em Braga dois anos seguidos. 2015 e 2016
O meu primeiro ano foi top. Não fiz quase nada, ganhei 600€ e trabalhei 1 mês. São 6 dias por semana e 5 horas por dia que da 30 horas semanais.
Eu passava a tarde sempre no telemóvel é esperava que as pessoas aparecessem.
Ganhava sempre 15 € por cada dia que ía e que podiam chegar a 25 € com os objetivos. Para ganhar os 25€ por dia só precisava de vender mais de 20 gelados o que era fácil.
No 2° ano foi diferente. Elevaram muito os objetivos. Existiam 3 objetivos. Minino(800€), Medio(1125) e Máximo(1485)
Mesmo que vendas pouco eles dar-te sempre o mínimo.
No inicio estava difícil para atingir o mínimo mas com umas vigarices e a chamar as pessoas consegui atingir o objetivo médio. A minha irmã atingiu o máximo.
Mas isso depende da zona onde estás.
Em Braga há muita gente mas há muitos cafés e as vezes era difícil.
Mas para quem não quer trabalhar muito aquilo é ideal e não conheço nada que pague melhor para o pouco que fazes.
Espero ter ajudado.

So lets say that there is a massive shock to the cheese-making industry in europe. Their ability to make cheese is suffering a major setback because of whatever. The issue is hitting enough EU member states that its a political issue, and the legislation surrounding cheesemaking and the economic structures to support it need to be reworked, to support changes needed on the ground in the cheesemaking industry. Its hardly going to collapse the entire economy, but those changes to legislation and supporting infrastructure are going to disrupt things. By being able to delay or not make these changes to our infrastructure, our cheese making industry is unnaffected, and we are able to sell cheese in europe in the interrim while things are being retooled. Even if we need to make the same changes as whatever becomes more serious there is a degree of delay available so that we don't have to take the entire industry down at once, and can cover shortfall.

Say its not a local issue but its also not immediate- legislation surrounding cheese making has become out of date in a way that prohibits, say engineered bacteria from being used. We can stress test new legislation without running the risk of disrupting the entire EU cheese-making industry by adopting legislation ahead of time and paying attention to how it works, helping mitigate the risks of moving the entire EU onto these standards.

Its about limiting the spread of issues so that an entire industry in that field isn't immediately affected accross all of europe.

,Jozef_Bem,,,"&gt;So, who's pushing them out of Turkey... Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, 


Terrible conditions and deprivation. I'm in Turkey right now, I volunteer with refugees. There over 3m of them here, Poles complain about a few thousand, the British complain about 20k and the Germans call themselves overstretched after taking about 1m (although I won't complain about them, as they're the only European country aside from Sweden that stepped up), there is legitimately a dearth of resources here and the Turks have an absolute right to want others to share in this burden.


&gt;Hungary and Austria? 


Hungary's government is as abusive and bigoted as PiS, and Austria has taken plenty of refugees like Germany.


&gt;Not to mention France, Italy etc.


*Not to mention what*, Oskar? France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Greece and Hungary are in the European Union, like Poland — that means that Poland has an obligation to share in the same burdens as the aforementioned countries, and there should be consequences otherwise.


&gt; I'm afraid that there're very few people left that would really take this argument seriously and these emotionally loaded comparisons are just a moral blackmail.

I'm glad that you feel it's moral blackmail, it means you're not a sociopath — unfortunately people are content with letting people die until they literally have to have a photo of a dead baby shoved in their face to remind them that their inaction makes them culpable.

However, since you think that moral obligations should somehow be a non-factor in policymaking in «[Wielka Polska Katolicka](http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/10/13/pope-francis-you-cant-defend-christianity-by-being-against-refugees-and-other-religions/)» let's talk about Poland's political obligations. The European Union is a voluntary association, there are benefits that no Pole wants to give up, but with those benefits are obligations. The wonderful thing is that the obligations aren't strenuous *at all*, welcoming a small number of people into the country is a no-harm-done situation.


&gt;The ""big deal"" is that there's no solution to the inflow of illegall immigrants, not even political will to enforce the law and there're too many lunatics in the European governments that actually wants more immigrants but then they wants also to share them like bags of potatoes. 


The solution is end the war in Syria, everyone has been dragging their feet on that one. You're right there's no will to enforce the law, which is why Poland is violating the laws it agreed to with regards to refugees.



How does wanting to offer human beings an opportunity to be safe from war and little cost make one a lunatic? How does wanting all European Union states to actually fulfill their obligations make one a lunatic? How do refugees hurt you?


&gt;It's just the beginning and this relocants quotas will change nothing and is used cynically the same by Merkle as by Kaczyński but for different reasons. 


It is just beginning. Centuries of imperialism, followed by persistent war against the Islamic world for the last two-three decades, and the environmental affects of the mass industrialization which (along with empire) made parts of Europe and the United States so rich is having tangible affects. We are in an age of migration. It's scary that people are suffering, but when you stop thinking in terms of Pole and not Pole and start thinking of us all creations of God, different yet equal, and remember that all children should be safe, it's not really that scary.


I don't like Angela Merkel, *at all* but it's not her who is wrong in this situation. The treatment of refugees and Muslim citizens in Germany under her government is a different story, but Poland has no moral high ground in that respect and that's beyond the scope of this conversation.


&gt;P.S. Personally I have nothing in partucular against controlled immigration or even moderate Muslims but I do not tolerate criminals that force their way through the borders.


The obstinate lack of cooperation and ""keep out"" mentality is what keeps a sense of organization and control from developing. Furthermore, your tone where you make it as if you're some sort of hero because you do thousands of your fellow citizens and a third of our world *the grand favor* of not hating our guts is pretty ridiculous. The term ""moderate Muslim"" is also ridiculous, the vast majority of pious Muslims are non-violent and as decent as anyone else, because that's what our religion teaches, the idea of the ""moderate Muslim"" is so loaded because it creates this really odious paradigm where Muslims are only acceptable if they're completely supine to a particular set of ideals originating in the European enlightenment, as if people who aren't European and Christian are intrinsically culturally and ethically lesser.


As for criminality, refugees aren't criminals, the law is incredibly clear on that point. You don't like the law so you pretend it doesn't exist.

,UnexcitedAmpersand,,,"Not really. The naval race did increase tensions, but even with them, there was no guarantee of war between the powers. The alliance Britain had with France was comically weak; so weak that we almost sat out of the war. There is no reason as to why the war of 1914 couldn't turn out like the war of 1870. Britain has never really enjoyed good relations with Russia, except out of convenience in the World Wars, nor have we been willing to upset the post-Napoleonic order. The thing which pushed us into the war was the march through Belgium. Belgium was our creature, who's position in Europe was brought about by the 1839 Treaty of London. Its neutrality was guaranteed by London and the other major powers and a key part of our European strategy. Like in 1939, with a lot events making a war more likely, it was the violation of a British guarantee and ultimatum which pushed us to war. It is important to recognise tensions and events which made a war thinkable/ possible, but its also important not to allow those events to overshadow the events that actually caused the war.

A similar thing can be said about the pacific conflict of WW2. A large number of negative events between Japan and America caused a great deal of tension. These pushed the two powers closer towards war. But it was the attack on Pearl Harbour which caused the war. The other Japanese actions, of taking the Dutch each indies or attacking Britains holdings, possibly would of caused a war, but it was far from guaranteed and American war plans from the late 1930s  suggest a far more limited type of conflict than what happened post Pearl Harbour. An even more stark example would be the American war with Germany in 1942. The American support for Britain caused a great deal of tension (as did the U-Boat campaign), along with American destroyers escorting American vessels (and even sinking a few U-Boats), but these events only made war more possible and probable.

,Richard_MF_Nixon,loners,Loner,"So STALKER isn't a Triple A release. It's got some weird spots as it was made in Eastern Europe with a small budget 10 years ago. Adjust your expectations. Mods like the *Zone Reclamation* Project can help with that. I did my first run Vanilla without any real issues, but you might have them.

STALKER is also not an RPG in the Fallout sense, in fact Fallout is a pretty bad comparison point IMO. The characters aren't the focus here, and they're fairly basic. There isn't an incredibly developed story, in fact the only time it gets super interesting is in the secret ending. Deep characters and an epic world saving quest aren't the point of the game. You're a scrappy trespasser trying to find out why you need to kill a guy in an incredibly hostile environment. The Zone itself is the star of the show here.

When people on here tell stories about Stalker, they don't talk about how they used their Charisma stat to turn an enemy into an ally. They talk about that time they were held up under a bridge, surrounded by Mercenaries with nothing but a couple grenades and an AK that jammed every third shot and somehow managed to survive it.

That said, treat it more like a survival game. You're trying to get from A to B with whatever supplies you have without getting murdered or over-expending your resources. Again, this is not an RPG. Treat it like that and you'll have a bad time. 

Also ignore all the difficulties but Master, the highest one. I'm not saying that because I think you need to ""git gud"" but because it's the intended mode. It makes both enemies and you go down in a few shots, and greatly improves the combat. It is still difficult however, and the game has been given the title of ""The Dark Souls of FPS"" by a good number of people.

Anyway, to sum it up

* This isn't Fallout or a Classic RPG. It's a single player Survival and Exploration game about being alone in a Ukrainian hellscape with a story tying it together. 

* The Zone and the world it creates is the focus

* Stalker can be buggy, use the ZRP mod to help with this. Also, save often. F5(6?) is your friend.

* Play it on Master difficulty

* The first few guns are pretty trash. The Viper 5 SMG is the first decent gun you get, but the double barrel is great for unarmored bandits and mutants at very close range.",True,False,0,1498935635,,False,0,djnmff2,t3_6knd41,t3_6knd41,1499824763,12,False,stalker,t5_2r74m,

,CrossMountain,,,"Well, I have to admit that I’m kinda obsessed with the idea to finish a World Conquest run in 1939. After this run I came to the conclusion that it’s not actually possible though, at least with my skillset. What hinders me the most is Justification time. I could take plenty more countries in the same amount of time, but justifying on them takes just so goddamn long.
 
The current run you see in the screenshot is kinda over, since I made a few mistakes that made the run longer then necessary. For example, I didn’t attack China before Japan was conquered and therefore allowing them to break up the Alliance with Communist China (meaning two Justifications instead of just one). I also didn’t take Dutch East Indies while I was at war with the Netherlands and I once had to cancel a justification in favor of another one. That’s about 50 to 100 days that I could’ve saved up until this point, so I’ll do it all over again (and with pleasure, I love this).
 
A quick summary of the current run:
 
Classic cheese with UK and France first (justified on both before I even started with any Foci). After that, I took Poland and attacked The Onion as soon as The Great Purge Focus was finished. While I was at war with Russia, I took Italy (and Yugoslavia), because why not. After The Onion was peeled, I took the US and started the very long war with Brazil. During the war with the US and Brazil, I went for some minor countries, like Australia, Canada, Mexico, Czechoslovakia, Philippines, British Raj, New Zealand and prepared for Japan. As soon as my troops were in position, I took Japan as well and started the war with China right after. While at war with China, I cleaned up Europe. And that's about it! If you've got any questions or ideas on how to do this even quicker, I'm more than happy to answer and/or read your suggestions!

edit: Forgot to mention that I made some rules for myself: No alliances, no puppets and just one Field General to accumulate all the experience.

Two reasons:
1. They do not have any rights to what they currently claim. Russia conquered Crimea and surroundings from the Tatars, it was not the ""ukrainians"" who lost it or took it.
2. When you have literal pogroms lynching opposing sides based on ethnicity, fueled by fake nationalism. The time for words and co-existance has ended.

Yanukovich was democratically elected, if the hohols couldn't get ""one of theirs"" into office through democracy, I'd say they do not have legitimacy to claim Ukraine as a sovereign nation.
It doesn't help that the kikes of america and europe were behind the coup either.

There is no evidence we had the ability to use that block against China prior to brexit. If the EU was that united I don't believe we would have left.

True but only fractionally

&gt;remains at risk of fracturing into smaller countries

All the independence movements are very weak at the moment, May's only success has been to put sturgeon in retreat. I suspect that there will be one more referendum that the nats will lose because all of the arguments used last time are even stronger this time.

&gt;What military power the UK still has (which does remain formidable) could give China a serious bloody nose. 

We are not formidable in this sense, we are (and have been for years) military welfare queens beholden to the US, like the rest of Europe. If we wanted to be military independent we would have to double defence spending to get in line with the us proportion spent on defence and then double it again to make up for the fact we are a smaller nation. Essentially we would become a modern Sparta. There are severe doubts as to whether we actually have the power to fire our nukes without American clearance. Our conventional military would be flattened by China, our only hope of a bloody nose would be in terroristic campaigns by the SAS which remains world class. Absent the US, we are military irrelevance.

&gt;China knows how the game of international politics is played. They know that a treaty only matters if you can do something to enforce it , which doesn't have to be a military response - even giving someone a worse deal in the future if they break a treaty can be an enforcement, but the UK can't even do that. Future deals? We're going to go cap in hand to the rest of the world begging for deals over the next few years.

Whilst I agree with your analysis here (aside from your perception of the EU trading block as a weapon we ever had serious influence over) I would urge you not to view trade deals in this way. It is not a 'begging bowl' we are attempting to create deals that rise above petty nationalist concerns. The EU's inability to get free trade deals signed was always its greatest weakness. Brexit is something I have very mixed feelings about but if we do gain the ability to sign our own trade deals we have to seize it. If we view trade in this win/lose lens, Brexit will be an unmitigated catastrophe. We can soften the affects of leaving with more free trade deals but they will never happen if the public views trade as a shameful activity that represents dependence

&gt;China can write the UK off as something to worry about. They didn't have to lift a finger; we did all this to ourselves. So sorry, people of Hong Kong. China will do whatever it likes and we can't do a thing about it.

Britain was always going to decline in importance from the high point of controlling 1/3 of  the world. Leaving the EU will probably cause a marginal increase in the rate of this decline but it is not as disastrous as you may to think because the EU did not give us that much geopolitical power in the first place. We did not do this to ourselves it is pretty unavoidable that a nation of 60 odd million will falter behind the colossus of 1 billion that is China. The fate of Hong Kong is tragic but unless we were willing to fight a war with american backing in the 90s it was somewhat inevitable. The most productive thing the west can do for Hong Kong is to pack our cultural exports with pro-democracy messages. Particularly our films are a weapon that we ought to use better against the despots of the developing world.",True,False,0,1498937352,,1498989440,0,djnnno5,t3_6klj8x,t1_djn4x88,1499825356,3,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,

Ah, não te preocupa com preconceito, metade da minha turma é de fora do estado. O pessoal vai debochar do teu sotaque, isso é certo, mas nenhum preconceito de verdade, nada sério.
&gt;Apesar de eu achar muito interessante linguagens de baixo nível, eu prefiro bem mais trabalhar com linguagens de alto nível, não havia considerado esse fator na decisão de ECP x CIC, obrigado por aponta-lo. Tô vendo que vou terminar fazendo CIC, desse jeito hauahua

É, ainda não tenho certeza porque ainda tô no primeiro semestre, mas pelo que eu vi em ECP a gente fica mais no baixo nível mesmo. Tem que ter bastante paciência. Ontem mesmo tive que fazer um código de 150 linhas numa linguagem semelhante ao Assembly, mas mais baixo nível ainda, pra fazer o mesmo que o comando pow(x, y) faria no C.
&gt;Uma das coisas que mais me deixou desmotivado quando fui aprender na internet sobre coisas de nível mais baixo foi a falta de material que eu conseguisse entender alguma coisa, a maioria do material era artigos, então a linguagem era excessivamente rebuscada.

Pois é, linguagens de baixo nível são bem mais difíceis de aprender, então isso afeta também a dificuldade de produzir material acessível e de fácil compreensão. Fica mais complicado aprender por conta própria. 

&gt;Agora uma coisa que eu senti falta na UFRGS e que vi muito em grades curriculares da ECP e CIC de universidades como UFSCAR e UFMG é o empreendedorismo: tem várias matérias de empreendedorismo nessas duas últimas que eu não vi na grade curricular da UFRGS. Como é isso ai, vocês não vêem isso na universidade?

Olha, não sei dizer ainda. Tem cadeiras de empreendedorismo e administração mais pra frente, mas são eletivas/adicionais.

The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (German: Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus) is a book written by Max Weber, a German sociologist, economist, and politician. Begun as a series of essays, the original German text was composed in 1904 and 1905, and was translated into English for the first time by American sociologist Talcott Parsons in 1930. It is considered a founding text in economic sociology and sociology in general.

In the book, Weber wrote that capitalism in Northern Europe evolved when the Protestant (particularly Calvinist) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment.

“**Sex, birth, and rebirth**” are pagan?  The first two items (sex &amp; birth) are not “pagan”, unless you’re asserting that every living organism engaging in sexual reproduction is “pagan”.  In regard to “rebirth”, that’s a common theme in just about every religion—from the buddhist “reincarnation” to the Christian evangelical “born again” dogma.  Some of the soundtrack’s lyrics were tailored to the plot, but that still doesn’t make any of your examples “pagan”.  Check Wikipedia’s entry on the film’s soundtrack.  Most of the soundtrack (featuring the band Magnet) uses British/Scottish/Irish traditional folk music.  

The “Maypole” is the closest thing to a uniquely pagan artifact, but the modern Christmas tree (not mentioned once in the Christian bible) is a direct descendant of the Maypole and European tree worship. So even the Maypole was adopted by Christianity.

At present EU law has force in the UK by virtue of the European Communities Act 1973. British courts are bound to apply EU law and to follow the rulings of the CJEU. If a new question of European law comes up, they have to refer the question to the CJEU and follow what the CJEU says. 

When we leave the EU, EU citizens' rights can be secured in a number of ways. The British position is that provision will be made in domestic law and enforced in UK domestic courts. At the international level, there will need to be a forum to interpret and enforce the provisions of the bilateral agreement between the UK and the EU. Naturally this has to be an independent forum and not one connected to one or other of the parties. So the CJEU shouldn't come in at all

The CJEU comes in only IF the UK domestic law is framed by reference to citizens' rights under existing EU law. This could be done in several ways:

1) As at present, UK courts are obliged to refer questions to the CJEU for decision and follow the rulings. This is clearly unacceptable to the UK. 

2) UK courts are not obliged to refer questions to the CJEU but are required to follow / have regard to CJEU case law on citizen's rights. 

3) UK courts are not obliged to follow existing CJEU case law (but will look at existing CJEU case law in any case because there is no other way to determine what existing EU law on citizens' rights is). 

If UK domestic law is not framed by reference to existing EU law on citizens' rights, but the bilateral agreement is, then instead of UK courts having to refer to the case law of the CJEU, it would be whatever international forum is chosen that would have to refer to CJEU case law as above.

However, relative to the US the clubs in Europe are much more autonomous and the league has less power. For example, the NBA and NFL negotiate one kit manufacturer for the whole league and distribute the revenue from it evenly among the teams. If this were not the case, teams like the Cowboys and the Packers would have huge contracts while no one would want to sponsor the Browns or the Jaguars.

,stefan_evm,,,"Hi EthWarrior,
agree with your statements. In the fiat world, especially considering uncovered short sales, this is something common that happens. The „classical“ financial world made some very hard lessons learnt when it comes to these things. Many aspects around all financial crises are related to those mechanisms.
The result: rigid regulation and very restricted access to these kind of products. Uncovered short sales and unlimited asset lending is something that is restricted and closely monitored by regulators, e.g. asset backed securities. If I, a simple guy, would want to do this in the classical financial world…well I would fail, because I just can’t, I am not allowed to. And even if I would do it, I would break law.
Now, with blockchains arising, which is still an unregulated field, where these ideas, concepts and mechanisms come up again. But: this does not make them much better than in den „old“ financial world, just because the technology is much better.
Please don’t get me wrong. I am a huge blockchain and Ethereum fan. And I am looking forward to EthLend going live, and I will most likely invest in it.  But I am risk-sensitive …My background is the German and European financial world (I am working as a consultant in the finance world, mainly IT stuff, mostly in regards to regulatory stuff).
I see a risk that history repeats, because the people that would exploit these blockchain products are the same that fucked up the „old“ financial world.

In a nutshell, there are two major risks from my perspective:
1) Regulatory risk: financial products on the Blockchain are illegal, as long as there are not offered from a registered, regulated financial company etc.
…but let’s for a moment forget about that risk. 
2) Even more I see the risk that financially strong players exploit the „system“, and damnify all the nice guys. We have to avoid this…because I think „we „ (the blockchain enthusiast) can be better then the old financial world.

To your last question: well, it is not really endless, I think, e.g. because of: 1) the debt to collateral ratio and 2) costs and provisions , 3) spreads etc.
But it does not need to be endless to be exploited. The question is: what are the mechanisms to prevent those exploits?",True,False,0,1498939373,,False,0,djnp2zo,t3_6kf4x6,t1_djniudv,1499826066,1,False,ETHLend,t5_3m8bp,

&gt;[They] laid down the dear king, the ring bestower, in the bosom of the ship, the renowned one beside the mast. There were many treasures from distant parts, precious things that were brought; I have not heard of a ship more beautifully adorned with war-weapons and battle-attire, swords and mail coats, a multitude of treasures lay upon his breast, that with him should go far into the power of the sea.

Ok so for once, I'm actually using my own translation so there are definitely some slight grammar mistakes but they shouldn't affect the meaning. These are lines 34-42 of *Beowulf* and give the details of Scyld's ship funeral. So how does that compare to what we find in the Sutton Hoo gravesite?

&gt;The ship at Sutton Hoo...contained a collection of precious objects intended to be of use to the dead person in the next life. These included a sword, a helmet, a mail-coat, a gold buckle, a purse with gold coins, a lyre, drinking-vessels, and a silver bowl; and they had come from a variety of sources, among them eastern Europe or the Near East.    (Beowulf, 29)

This quote leaves out a few other items such as textiles, a handful of spears, shoulder clasps, spoons, etc. All of these items were piled around and on where the body should have been (no human remains were actually found within the grave). In addition, the burial chamber on the ship was located in the center where the mast would be (there was no mast found with the Sutton Hoo ship). So as you can see, the *Beowulf* quote does seem to match the Sutton Hoo find pretty well. That's not really that difficult though since the *Beowulf* quote is frankly a pretty generic description.

It is easy to link Sutton Hoo and this passage since they are both Anglo-Saxon in origin but you have to keep in mind that the description in the poem matches pretty much every single ship burial we have found, along with the descriptions of ship burials/funerals in other works (at least as far as I've seen in my studies. Someone correct me if I'm misguided). Perhaps the mention of ""treasures from distant parts"" would allow us to narrow the field down a bit but I don't know. It makes sense to tie *Beowulf* to Sutton Hoo but the description is so generic to my eyes that it really doesn't sit well with me when people say definitively that the *Beowulf* passage was inspired by the Sutton Hoo burial.

- Learning to read/write Korean is very easy. They use an ""alphabet"" called Hangeul and they have ""letters"", eg. ㅎ = h, ㅏ= a, ㄴ = n. The main difference between our alphabet and Hangeul is that we go letters -&gt; words -&gt; sentences, while Hangeul goes letters -&gt; syllables -&gt; words -&gt; sentences.

Using the h a n from above, we just string them together like han. In Korean they make a syllable, 한. You put these syllables together to make words, eg 한글 (Hangeul). (ㄱ = g, ㅡ = eu*,  ㄹ = r/l.)     *not a diphthong, just a Korean vowel sound that's hard to explain using the alphabet

You can easily learn this system in a relatively short time frame, even though you won't understand a word you're reading/writing. It's really all about memorizing which symbols mean what.

,goonsack,centi,MAGA,"My supposition over what would happen if I tried to bring invaders into Israel is not me talking out of my ass, I'm basing this on real precedent. Israel protects its country from anything it perceives as a threat with lethal force. Example is the [raid on the Gaza flotilla from Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid). The boats were in international waters when Israeli commandos boarded and attacked. They shot nine civilians to death and a tenth later died in hospital. 

&gt;Most Israelis however are right of center and we had a center-right government for about a decade now. To suggest that somehow most Israelis support that, and that this is some kind of an evil plan of ours (and our government's) to destabilize Europe or whatever is fucking nuts.

Many Jews and Israelis have a complete double standard about refugees and migrants when it comes to their own ethnostate versus the homelands of European peoples and other traditionally European-derived Western nations like the USA. I know that the right wing in Israel is in power and protects its own demographics doggedly. But they do not consistently apply this logic to countries that aren't theirs. 

You seem to be suggesting here  that there are only two factions of Jews: those who are against mass immigration and multiculturalism in both the West and Israel, and those who are for it in both the West and Israel. This is simply not true. There is in fact a sizeable third faction that is against it when it comes to Israel but for it when it comes to the West.

In fact, the view of America as a multicultural/multiethnic collective (an idea that did not exist when America was founded) was very much shaped by people from the third faction. 

Two of the most oft-cited refrains to justify this multicultural/multiethnic utopian vision -- the ""[melting pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Melting_Pot_(play))"" of America and the ""[give me your tired, your poor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus)"" -- were inventions of Zionist Jews ([Israel Zangwill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Zangwill) and [Emma Lazarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Lazarus)). They both (hypocritically) promoted the view of America as an open doors nation (supplanting its traditional status as a nation of Western European stock) while simultaneously advocating for an ethnically pure homeland for their own people as leading Zionists.

&gt;Israel (edit - and Jewish communities worldwide) definitely have far left fringes who are pushing suicidal policies for Israel and I wouldn't be surprised if they take part in the pro rapefugee stuff as well. 

It's not just a fringe though. Let's take the refugee controversy in America and American rabbis as an example. 

Refugee contractor HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) claims scriptural justification of ""welcoming the stranger"" for refugee importation.

https://www.hias.org/2000rabbis

They also got 2000 American rabbis (a majority of them) to sign onto their pro-refugee letter.

So it's not just secular American Jews that want open borders, in fact it seems that [2001](https://www.hias.org/2000rabbis) out of [3209](http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/RABBI.asp) rabbis in America (62.4%) want to continue importing refugees into the USA through the resettlement program. And about 300,000 (32.7%) of all refugees imported since 9/11 have actually been Muslim (source is Wrapsnet http://ireports.wrapsnet.org/) despite Muslims only making up 24% of the world population at large.

Meanwhile only [36% of Americans at large](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/08/16/poll-most-americans-oppose-syrian-refugee-resettlement-in-u-s/) support resettling Syrian migrants in the US (The Syrians resettled in the US are about 97% Sunni Muslim).

Of course there are Jews opposed to mass immigration, we're obviously not talking about a monolithic group, but the level of support for open borders among leaders of the Jewish faith/community is really quite striking. 

The mass importation of third worlders into America is apparently one of the few issues that various Jewish sects can agree upon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbLfb1EvSxw

,newPhoenixz,,,"That doesn't sound like a reasonable explanation, but then why does this sort of stuff happen continuously in the US and hardly ever in Europe? 

In North west Europe there too are high speed and low speed chases but there it hardly happens that police officers best up suspects (note that they are not convicted criminals at arrest, as far as that would make a difference because even convicted criminals are still humans with rights) 

I think it also has a lot to do with hiring practices, training, and how the job is perceived by all.. In north west Europe afaik they search for people with psychological profiles that are intelligent and calm, and I've read on occasion (yes, that's not really evidence) that in the US a profile like that is likely to get you rejected for a job as police officer. Add to that that, again, in Europe they are trained for years on end while (from what I've read on Reddit) in the US the training lasts only something like 6 months. 

Then finally, in Europe police is there to protect and serve, while in the US they are much more authoritive. I can pick 10 random police videos from the US and you'll almost guaranteed have a good amount of them showing police officers not directly being abusive, but they very much have this half-dickish attitude like ""I'm the boss and either you cooperate with me, or I will fuck you up"". I regularly watch police video footage from Holland and the difference in attitude I'd striking. Sure, they still are police, and sometimes there are situations with suspects where they indeed need to show that attitude, but most of the time their attitude is much more ""hi good day, I'm a human being doing his job. I might have to give you a ticket but that is because you broke this and this rule. Have a great day!"" 

All this also makes a big difference with how police officers are perceived by the general public. In Holland, police officers are just people with a job and their friends aren't limited to other police officers. Off duty police officers are mostly not acting as if they are on the job (I'm remembering one case now, and she was fired, and jailed for acting so anyway) and it makes for a lot less problems in general..

The club can facilitate offering new contracts to Alexis and Özil by cutting deadwood and fringe players however it's unlucky that the club will cut players to accommodate those who don't wish to stay. 

A team's wage bill cannot increase by more than £7 million per season unless it's covered by increased revenue such as ticket sales, transfers, European football, and commercial deals. Our revenue is unlikely to increase enough because we've dropped out of the Champions League and we'd struggle to generate it from transfers which means we'd have to focus on cutting the wage bill.

It's possible that selling Alexis and therefore cutting around £7 million wages may allow the club to offer players such as Özil, Ramsey, and the Ox better contracts and it could allow the likes of Szczesny to return to the first team. As well as making it easier to recruit new players.  

It's a pretty shitty situation but the club is left with either accomodating an expensive player who doesn't want to stay at the club then lose him on a free or get around £50-60 mil and bring in (or keep) those who want to play for Arsenal.

Race&amp; ethnicity became reified in the last 300 years but migration continued after that. 'Whiteness' didn't pre-exist slavery and is a brutal form of supremacy &amp; privilege and is NOT an ethnicity. Whiteness exists in opposition, even in the 20th century, Irish, Italian, Greek, Jew &amp; Russian were often excluded. 

That said, time to knock 'white people' as described in this picture, down a few pegs.

Ancient Rome: Multi-ethnic, pagan, royal intermixture with North Africans, Phoenecians, Central Asians, Turkic peoples. Rome was a cosmopolitan center.  Late Roman antiquity acknowledge the Jews as free partners, but oppressed Christians.

Ancient Greeks: Strains credulity to call them 'white' as, again, Egypt, Phoenecia, Turkish planes, southern Europe all vastly intermixed. Alexander the Great's empire extended to and included hecking Pakistan for hecks sake. 

I can't see all the people, but I think they are Shakespeare, Darwin, Tesla, Aristotle, da Vinci &amp; someone I can't see.

Aristotle: From the era of Greece I mentioned above. Died in Macedonia.  *Literally only preserved because Islamic philosophers kept the ancient Greek tradition alive while Christian Europe banned them*

Also, for the record:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhism#Philosophical_influences

Da Vinci, Darwin &amp; Shakespeare are indisputably white, no doubt there, but Tesla is Serbian who, if are white traditionally conceived, are definitely not nor ever have been considered equals in Europe. Furthermore, Tesla renowned for his genius has, nonetheless, not left us many inventions as a legacy, mostly theoretical ideas.  

But, as some nuance, Da Vinci &amp; Shakespeare were raised Catholic (and Tesla Orthodox). 

Darwin was raised unitarian, a free thinker and from a family of know abolitionists.  Darwin himself was an abolitionist his whole life, was against the exploitation of the working class and was tutored by a freed slave.  He held shitty white man's burden views and his theory is in many ways the political economy of Smith &amp; Malthus applied to nature (which he himself acknowledges) and, furthermore, was incomplete until the Neo-Darwinian synthesis, to the point where the original evolutionists from Darwin, Lamarck, Wallace up to Mendel, Haeckel, etc are basically indistinguishable. 

There are doubts (some confirmed) about Shakespeare's authorship.   

Da Vinci left us a legacy of some great art, though his scientific achievements weren't much, in reality.

That said, for each of these geniuses, whatever their contribution are innumerable contributions of non-white folks.

Ibn Khaldun, Al-Farabi, Avicenna, Averreos &amp; Al Ghazali are examples. Not only do Maimonidies, Anselm etc directly credit them for their ideas, but they also preserved Plato, Artistotle, the Pre-Socratics, Christian &amp; Jewish philosophy, innovated in science, math, engineering &amp; so on.  

Ibn Khaldun intimated both the theory of political economy, evolution by selection, the philosophy of history &amp; social theory by 400 years. None other than Arthur Laffer (Reagonomics lol!) credits him with ideas.

Avicenna influenced epistemology, logic, ethics, philosophy of science, geology, physics, psychology, astronomy &amp; chemistry in ways which lingered on through Aquinas, Maimonidies, Ockham &amp; nearly all Enlightenment philosophers. 

Averreos invented secularism &amp; separation of church &amp; state, as well as faith &amp; reason as we know it today. He is responsible for Plato &amp; Aristotle's legacy. He influenced physics, medicine, psychology, astronomy, jurisprudence &amp; law. 

For the record, Dante thought both Averreos &amp; Avicenna were so wise that they would go to the land of enlightened Pagans with Plato &amp; Aristotle etc--i.e. they were so worthy they became effective Christians by proxy. 

Leo Strauss credits Al-Farabi with substantial innovation, influencing political philosophy, metaphysics, ehtics, logic, science, cosmology, math &amp; music. He basically smuggled in secularism &amp; skepticism into the main tradition, figuring out a way that radical philosophers could continue unmolested by political &amp; religious figures. Without that idea, imagine the Reformation happening!

Al-Ghazali was more mystical, but had a historigraphical influence over the long term.  Ibn Tufail influenced empiricism credit by Locke, Leibniz, Voltaire, Berkeley, Hume, Hobbes, Newton &amp; Kant. Al-Biruni had some legacy in geography, astronomy, the history of religion &amp; of india &amp; pharmacology. 

There are also substantial traditions in India, China etc, with obvious names like Confucius, Lao-Tsu, Mencius, Nagarjuna, Buddha and so on.  That there are extensive literary &amp; art traditions in India &amp; China is indisputable. 

Epic poems of comparable quality to Homer, for example, exist indisputably in the Middle East, India, China &amp; so on.  While these traditions had less of a pictographic art tradition, they nonetheless had considerable traditions. As we all know, China beat the west to seafaring, gunpowder, paper, mass organized currency &amp; bureaucracy, meritocracy, large scale free trade zones &amp; standard measurement taxation &amp; protection. 

Suffice it to say, Ancient Greek &amp; Roman ideas, literature, philosophy &amp; so on intermixed as far as with nascent Hindu &amp; Buddhist ideas.  Later on Jewish, Muslim, Christian &amp; Latin ideas continued to intermix, with some Eastern nexus as well.

Genghis Khan &amp; the Mongol empire extended across the 'known' world, integrated trade, ideas, religion, art, philosophy, music, politics &amp; literal DNA from China &amp; Korea, to India, to Central Asia, to the Arabian Peninsula, to Russia, to Eastern Europe &amp; Turkey.  


Mongol, Mughal, Chinese, Ottoman &amp; Arabian empires all extended as far as Western ones and were as Cosmopolitan.

I do not see conquering as a plus, given how brutal they are, but suffice it to say, extended European empire was not original, nor was it as cosmopolitan &amp; integrated over long distances.  

Polymaths like Da Vinci, Tesla &amp; Darwin, as I stated above, definitely and openly existed in the Muslim world (for 1000 years while Europe stagnated) and somewhat comparable in India &amp; China.  Playwrights &amp; literature also definitely existed on equal scale to Shakespeare in each of these places. 

Countries being under European control isn't an argument for, but against white people.  Given how brutal these were.  

The last are the collider, the space program, the fighter jet &amp; the Declaration of Independence.

The collider is a specifically international project, with scientists from literally everywhere in the world participating, notably India, China, Japan etc.  

The space program is such bs--we got the man on the moon, but the Soviet Union got EVERY other milestone.  The USSR was famously multi-racial, multi-ethnic--15% Muslim, 20% Orthodox, 5% Jewish with over 20 different major ethnicities, 'Russians' themselves a construct who were basically a majority-minority in the USSR.

Therefore neither the collider &amp; the space program can be credited to 'white' people (or even European people even if Jews are included, which many Nazis don't do).

The plane I can't speak to, though I don't see military achievements as that great.  That said, Soviet military aviation was always as good as, if not better than the US.  Commercial the US was better, but that's because the USSR didn't have 'commerce', per se. Suffice it to say, innovations in aviation have occurred everywhere in the world from Japan to China to India etc.  And, let's not forget that India managed to reproduce our aviation, space travel &amp; so on more effectively and pennies on the dollar--the Indian space program cost less than the movie 'Gravity.'  Even where Elon Musk works on commercial flight to space, Russia beat him to it a long time ago.

While Russia &amp; Jews are white by privilege, they are often excluded from Nazi accounts, that said, both groups have large degrees of ethnic intermixture and are part of larger cosmopolitan conglomerates.  With that in mind, in addition to the above, think about how many innovations in philosophy, science, literature etc were made by Jews, from the Torah, Talmud, up through Maimonidies &amp; Kaballah up to Spinoza, Ricardo, Marx, Freud, Einstein, Trotsky, Buber, Husserl, Arendt, Strauss, Bohr, Feynmann, von Neumann, Szilard, Salk, Sagan, Oppenheimer, Pannekoek, Pauli, Bergson, Bellow &amp; Beshevis-Singer. And, IRONICALLY, how many famous right wingers &amp; neoliberals? Ludwig von Mises, Murray Rothbard, Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman &amp; Walter Block, Kirzner &amp; Hazlitt to Gary Becker, Paul Samuelson, Kenneth Arrow, Akerlof, Bernanke, Greenspan &amp; Yellen to radicals, keynesians &amp; lefties like Luxemburg, Sraffa, Stiglitz, Simon, Polanyi, Marglin, Leontief, Kantorovich, Krugman, Hilferding.

They can't have it both ways, either Jews are white, in which case the Crusades, Holocaust etc were self-defeating 'democides' or they aren't &amp; they don't get the credit.

Finally, the Declaration--written &amp; signed by white people, for white people, though in the context of slavery &amp; desire for its abolition, influenced by the Native American federation, copying the Magna Carta &amp; riffing off Paine who was a true radical.  But, fine, let 'white people' have the document which was so hypocritical half of its signers were embarrassed to call for independence as women, people of color &amp; indigenous folks were subjugated. 


tldr: race &amp; ethnicity is a social construct, whiteness is privilege &amp; not ethnicity BUT, for the record, no achievement attributed to 'white people' can be consistently &amp; unproblematically be claimed. 

If you're gonna be a racist supremacist piece of shit, at least get your history right (oh, wait, that's impossible).

£350million extra to the NHS.  Remember that?

&gt; And what vested interests? Sounds a bit too much like a conspiracy theory to me.

Murdoch's media empire.  He's got an open door to 10 Downing Street, but cannot bend the ear of the EU and hates that.  Russia wants a weak EU and NATO to facilitate Putin's long-term goal of re-establishing a 21st century equivalent of the old Soviet Union.

&gt; Being outside of the EU will (in theory) allow us to negotiate free trade agreements with countries outside Europe, such as India, China, and many African countries too.

We've already got trade agreements with all those countries, via the increased bargaining power of the EU.  How will our lone voice carry more influence than a combined bloc of 500+ million citizens?

&gt; It means we can have more control over who comes into the country. 

Germany already kicks out undesirable immigrants under existing EU laws.  The UK has the same right but has failed to use them.  Why not?

&gt; It means that power is devolved away from the European Parliament and more power returned to our own. 

Depending on how you count, the EU has made nowhere near even half of UK laws.  Estimates range from 13% upwards.  We already have self-determination and sovereignty over our own laws.

&gt; If you're for more devolution of power to Wales, Scotland etc then it's the same principle.
&gt; Personally I don't think that the solutions to these problems are unattainable. Hope, not despair (if you're into that kinda thing) ;)

It's like you're defending Trump against talking points that I'm not even making. I'm not the ""liberal media,"" a ""coastal elite,"" or a member of the ""deep state."" I'm just another concerned citizen of the US. Please reply to what I actually say instead of what you perceive the opposition party is saying.

&gt; Obama was caught on a hot mic saying that he'll presumably help Russia as soon as he gets re-elected but apparently that's just A-OK and not worthy of attention?

Oh are you referring to an election 5 years ago? It's worthy of attention but the obvious implication was that he didn't want to turn foreign policy with Russia into a domestic campaign issue. It's an unfortunate reality that a new policy will turn into a political issue regardless of its legitimacy if it's implemented during an election season. Surely you don't actually believe Obama (of all people jfc) was a Putin puppet, right?

&gt; Or the Clintons getting millions from dozens of countries, that deserves relatively not attention compared to Trump?

Does Trump not have properties literally straddling the globe? I'd prefer a candidate without foreign financial ties but unfortunately neither Clinton nor Trump was close to immune from those.

&gt; Do you honestly believe that Clinton would collude less with Russia compared to Trump?

Obviously yes. Russia's relationship with the West is more strained now than at any point since the Cold War, probably even into the 70s or 60s. The existing Democratic administration was taking a pretty hardline approach, meanwhile Trump's White House has been making calls in Congress to water down their sanctions bill, which only exists because even Republicans are afraid Trump will cave to Russian demands of removing sanctions unilaterally. 

Yes, Clinton would've continued the Obama era policy of sanctions and opposition to Russia's aggression. You do realize Trump flirted with pulling out of NATO right? It's not hard to be more anti-Russia when your opponent is calling for a breakup of America's military alliance against Russia lol.

&gt; What exactly do you need to prove Trump is not Putin's puppet? Start WW3?

Again defending claims I haven't made. It would be nice for Trump to at least treat Russia like any other issue. He shits on basically any policy, country, international body, etc. except for the fucking mafia state running Russia. He could at least acknowledge what our intelligence agencies and those of our allies have already acknowledged months ago. He could at least avoid *literally* asking for Russian hacks of his (American) political opponents at campaign events. He could at least tell his staff to stop withholding disclosures of meetings with Russian officials until someone else finds out about them and then shifting the narrative to ""I don't recall that meeting last month with Kislyak or that other one last summer or the other one last April."" He could at least come out in support of some kind of sanctions or other policies designed to punch back after Putin has openly begun fucking with Western democracies around the world instead of seeking to erode the existing sanctions put in place after Putin's land grab and ground war in Eastern Europe.

My brother went deep into thought for two minutes, then his argument came through that it is different, because Putin is a crook, it’s an authoritarian government etc. True or not true, it is hypocrisy.

And since we can't ""pick and chose"", this means a hard brexit.

&gt; We can have tariff free access...customs union...without having to accept The EU Court of Justice or full FoM.

The EU would never allow that!

Customs union without ECJ?  Turkey is in the customs union and has to abide by the ECJ.

That's not even close to what most people are using 'hard brexit' to mean!

The only way you could be against this refugee relocation system is if you were racist or have a limited understanding on the subject. The first is usually a result of the latter, though.

&gt;And for the record, I said it was PO that signed Poland up to such a shitty deal, not PiS. That is a fact.

You know saying that just implies ""because we have a different government now, it doesn't apply anymore"". Because it does.

Yet they've never managed to compete with the top U.K. teams at LAN compared to what their online performances have shown. Online is flukey but it gives a good image of how we should rank teams. Very few teams become significantly worse from online to LAN and vice versa with the best example being eLv during stage 2 of Black Ops 3. 

Being someone that is from Europe, playing against the French is significantly different compared to Spaniards, Germans and the odd Italians. Any Brit will tell you that there's a difference. Can't be telling me that the best team in Europe for Stage 1 in BO3 managed to win **once** against Vitality and say that it's flukey when they were somehow getting shit on by the worst team in the league. Top U.K. teams rarely ever lose to low tier UK teams and the 2Ks is a good indicator for this. 

And ""nobodies"" chatting shit doesn't mean that their point isn't valid. If Supremacy consistently beat Splyce online and always won the 2K and went to LAN and didn't make T12, anyone can give them shit because they clearly can't replicate their online performances on LAN.
