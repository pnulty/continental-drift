First you need to ask a question.

Why is Africa so far behind other continents with regards to their economic development and infrastructure?

To answer this, you have to start with Europe. A lot of people don't realize this, but Paris is on roughly the same parallel as Boston. If you've ever been to both cities in winter, you would notice a significant difference in the climate. Western Europe is extremely temperate due to it's relative location to the equator and favorable air currents that keep out a lot of the Arctic chill that invades North America every year. It has very fertile soil and pretty much every condition you could ask for to achieve rapid population growth.

Population growth spurs innovation. The more people you have, the more problems that need solving. One of these problems is land. Europe does not have a lot of it relative to their population. Thus, the need for European nations to colonize. Colonialism is a nice way of saying ""go into a place and steal its resources"". The evangelical aspect of Christianity was also a factor, but more of an excuse IMO.

Now to Africa. First off, Africa is separated by north and south. There's a big ass desert in between and the people, culture and languages on each side are completely different from each other. There are multiple cultures that existed in Africa at the same time as the Greeks and the Persians that were as advanced. The Egyptians, Nubians and Ethiopians were very advanced societies in their day. Sub-Saharan Africa? Not so much. Plenty of culture, but not a lot of tech. Why? Isolation. Much like Native Americans and Aboriginal peoples, there was little reason to develop advanced technology without the threat of conflict or invasion by foreigners.

Unfortunately, this made them sitting ducks for the colonial powers once they decided they owned the world. So Europeans came in, implemented their way of life, stole a bunch of natural resources and then left. Even today, a lot of the natural wealth Africa has is controlled by Western or Chinese companies. These companies pay directly to the government for these rights. The governments are usually corrupt and money doesn't really trickle down the way Paul Ryan thinks it does.

There's so much more, but you could argue that African nations got off better than some other colonies. Native Americans and Aborigines only have reservations carved out of whole continents that used to be theirs. Africans still have most of their territory. The other HUGE advantage Africans have is common ancestry with the descendants of slaves.

Over the last 500 years or so, people of African descent have integrated into Western society and culture. Some of the most powerful of these people have begun investing in developing stronger societies in African countries. It may seem like a small thing today, but I think you're going to see a number of countries in Africa become the number one hotbed for new investment the way China was about 20 years ago.

When Americans get married, and especially when they have kids, their whole world turns in on their family. It's like an implosion. Frankly, I'm amazed these people go out at all. Most parents I know just stop having a social life altogether.

In Europe and Israel (where I lived), parents had a life outside of their families. They still went out with their friends—separate from their spouses. I even knew one couple that still went to raves and got drunk and did peyote in the desert, but obviously only when one parent stayed at home with the kid. And they were amazing, wonderful parents with the happiest baby I've ever known. It was eye-opening for me, being American.

Part of me feels like the American thing isn't a lack of desire for a family-separate social life. I honestly think a great deal of it has to do with people's bullshit thinking that it's somehow ""inappropriate"" or ""un-adult"" to have fun the ways they used to once you've had kids. So instead of enjoying themselves (independently), they look down on the people who do as immature and selfish.

,kieslowskifan,qualitycontributor,Top Quality Contributor,"Although the BoB and the Blitz have monopolized public memory of the air assault on Allied countries, air attacks continued throughout the war. Attacks on the UK saw a shift away from pursuing allegedly military objectives to pure retaliation. The Baedeker Raids in the spring of 1942 were explicitly targeting UK sights of cultural and historical significance as retaliation for the RAF's nightbombing of German cities. German air raids continued sporadically after Baedeker and the last massed manned air assaults on the UK were in January to May 1944 with Operation Steinbock. These raids ran into the teeth of an increasingly effective Allied air defense network and aside from *Jabo* attacks by single-seat fighters, most bombers units had difficulty maintaining an acceptable ratio of losses to sorties to remain functioning. These diminishing returns underlay the move to the V-1 and V-2 which although they lacked the accuracy of a manned bomber, could reach their targets. The last manned air attack on London occurred in the night of 29/30 May 1944, and Luftwaffe aircraft after Normandy were restricted to either conducting manned V-1 attacks on the UK or pinprick intruder raids against Allied airfields, like Operation Gisela in 3/4 March 1945 where nightfighters followed home an RAF bomber stream and attacked them in the process of landing on UK airfields. 

The UK of course was not the only Allied country. There were also Luftwaffe attacks on the Low Countries as Allied forces liberated them as well as attacks on Red Army forces in Poland.  Luftwaffe aircraft did bomb Warsaw during the 1944 rising and the level of destruction did hearken back to an earlier period where Germany held air superiority. V-2 raids continued on Antwerp until March 1945 and Operation Bodenplatte on 1 January 1945 saw a massed German air attack on Belgian and French airfields.

The Luftwaffe did maintain reconnaissance and isolated intruder flights over Western Europe and to a lesser extent, Eastern and Southern Europe through the war's end. But by mid-1944, the Luftwaffe was a broken reed that could not accomplish much. Its manned bomber missions could not be conducted during daylight hours and fuel shortages meant the planes could not take to the skies in adequate numbers. This meant that after Steinbock, the German air raids were pinpricks dwarfed by the truly massive Allied aerial armadas. None of these manned raids met with a degree of success and only the Warsaw bombing accomplished much in the way of destruction- and here the Luftwaffe had the benefit of the Red Army running at the limits of its supply lines as well as Stalin's political refusal to help the Home Army. Even if the objectives of Luftwaffe bombing shifted from military ones to simply extracting a cost in Allied civilian lives the manned force as incapable of meeting that goal.

Also allied commanders erroneously believed in not using it in Europe were Germans were considered more capable of reverse engineering the technologically. Anyway that's what my history teacher told me so if I'm wrong do chime in and correct me. Cheers.

This, to me, indicates Europeans are overwhelmingly negative toward Islam and muslims. Which, tbh, reflects the general vibe I have here in France (that said, I live on the border of a muslim neighborhood so the problems in that community are very pronounced around me).

Anyway, mate, I don't think we're ever going to see eye to eye. I don't like Islam or a strong muslim presence in my country, maybe you do. You do you. But please do not try to make it look like we're happy with it. Most of us aren't.

-What do you mean ""economical power""? Also, there was a world market in Victoria II's era that only got stronger.
-Low world prices mean lower regional prices because of imports, there should be some variation but don't just get rid of World prices
-laissez faire actually counters capitalists stupidity pretty well with its massive boost to factory output, also, having the right AI for capitalists is really hard to do
-the transition to trench warfare only really happened when there were massive concentrations of troops on both sides. One could try simulating that by having a ""trench warfare"" modifier if troops in a region or province are above a certain dynamic limit.
-what's wrong with Victoria II's naval invasions? For me, the U.K. has been an outstanding ally or difficult enemy. They usually build enough transports to transport vast amounts of mobilized men to the front on the continent (they didn't walk through the strait). The problem is the AI never upgraded their ships so when I engage Britain for the first time in 1910, my cruisers just walk over their frigates. 
-What's HPM's dynamic coring system? Isn't it the same as PDM's? 

Now, some comments of my own
-Have a tension meter before you can declare war. For example, you can only declare an acquire state war when the tension rises above fifty (tension rises when you justify and when you have a cb). The AI mobilizes when there is, say, 25 tension (it's only between you and another country). That way, the AI can mobilize before a war starts. 
-have a simulation of irregular warfare, which means you need to tie down troops which suffer attrition when you fight irregulars
-Dynamic cap on factory limits
-make soldier pops part of an overall pool or make it so you can recruit regiments per region, not province 
-Make planned economy less of a hassle (for example, have bureaucrats take over the capitalists role, factory profits all go to the government but you need to put in money into a fund which the bureaucrats use to build and upgrade factories.)
-Less but more serious (and dynamic) crises
-Somehow slow down Russia and other less developed nations industrialization and infrastructure(especially infrastructure, in my games, Russia by 1914 has max railroads in its populated European areas.$
-Make elections more fair and informative
-Remove information that's accurate

-please, for the love of God, buff Jan Mayen.",True,False,0,1498871763,,False,0,djmo5b2,t3_6ki8np,t1_djmasnz,1499807935,9,False,paradoxplaza,t5_2su3h,

Neither interesting nor particularly relevant his point is that Republicans are immoral and I am simply pointing out that it is preposterous to accuse politicians of being immoral for doing what they were elected to do. Any other party would be lauded for doing what they were voted upon to do why are Republicans different. His issue is that Republicans disagree with his politics which is not a moral issue, but a political one. As I began he lacks an objective moral standard to judge them.

*Just because something is/was legal, doesn't make it morally right as every history book would show you.*

And just because you personally distaste something doesn't make it morally wrong. Where do you draw your moral righteousness from and if it's from yourself why do I care.

*it's seen as rational for gay people to be given more rights than guns.*

And this is purely disingenuous as no one is denying the LGBTQ community any rights. Indeed I would argue marriage is not in fact a right protected under the Constitution nor does it fall within the purview of the government to protect unlike guns. You are simply being intellectually dishonest by sarcastically implying that I don't hold the view gay people deserve rights as people. Rather I believe marriage is not a governmental issue and for homosexuals who often lobby for Republicans to stay out of their bedroom I'm tickled by the irony of them begging Democrats to hop in.

*I'm not American and don't know Republicans personally but if they ran my country, I'd be ashamed*

This is literally a pointless aside, no one cares about your levels of shame. Personally I think Europeans are pathetic for bending over for Eurocrats, but my personal opinions are irrelevant much like yours or for this matter the OP's. 

*They're possibly the most anti-intellectual, heartless, elitist and bigoted main party in the Western world*

The irony of perfectly describing the Democratic party is precious, you left out corruption though.

*Also if your reasoning for dismissing evidence about climate change is some scandals, than you must believe Donald Trump is a fictional character.*

This is known as a false equivalency between scandals whereupon Climate Change zealots were caught lying about temperature data and Donald Trump being accused of collaborating with Russia. Donald Trump is a self evident person who is regularly seen in public and television and has mountains of visual and written evidence. Beyond the articles of faith I ascribe as almost biblical in nature Climate Change is pathetically underwhelming.

Have you considered an interview with a London architect to get the technical parts of your investigation right? [Gensler](https://www.gensler.com/offices) or [Foster+Parters](
http://www.fosterandpartners.com/contact/) are two of the biggest names in the world, both with London and NYC offices, and they will be extremely well versed in global fire code requirements for MCM panels. You'll get other good information by talking to a large contractor, local code officials, and people at FPA/NFPA. This can all help you understand MCM panels and the construction process.

Google tells me the architect on the project is Studio E Architects in London. Can we ask them who approved or specified Reynobond PE? Was this the original product in the specification, or was there a substitution? Did they put responsibility for specification and approval in the hands of a junior employee or intern who didn't know what they were doing? What person specifically at that company put their name on the approval of the panels submitted by the general contractor? Were the original panels value engineered out of the job? Who was involved in the value engineering process? Did anyone contact the city in writing warning them of the use of the PE panels on the building? Did the city ignore warnings about PE panels going on this building? Was any of this in writing? I'm sure at this point, nobody on the project team is talking to anyone except their lawyers. The architect is likely looking at losing their business, and anyone who was connected to this job will lose their license. We'll see how this pans out, but I'm looking at the architect #1. It could be incompetence or poor oversight, but no matter the issue, the government has an obligation to take licenses and shut down that business if this is the case.

As part of the Building Regulations Fire Safety Approved Document B, Section 12.5 requires BS 8414 testing, or other exceptions can be followed (depending on height, fire separation distance, etc). This code language reads very similarly to IBC Section 1407, which is the equivalent US section. BS 8414 is similar to NFPA 285 testing here in the US; these are both considered world class standards for full scale fire testing. I'd be curious why you would say flammable materials are allowed, when it clearly seems like flammable materials are not allowed, and the building code has provided guidance for buildings of various height. Is this article more just a reason to attack politicians? I'd say they DO have proper building codes in the UK. Am I missing something here?

* A designer (architect or other consultant) provides a specification in the construction documents. In the US, it is up to the architect to be sure products meet code. The specifications may have listed a performance requirement, or given the exact panels to use. It would be good to see the architect's specification for this project to see what they specified. I'm sure this will be released in the investigation.
* Construction documents are submitted to a municipality for a building permit. Specifications may or may not be required by a municipality, and it's not really up to the city to review every single material to be put on the building.
* After the permit, the installer will provide a product submittal to the designer, by way of a general contractor. Construction contracts can happen in various ways, so it would be good to know how the team was setup for this job.
* The project team (architect or consultant) gives their approval of the product that is submitted by the contractor. Every product must be signed off by the architect before being installed. It is up to the architect to confirm that the submitted product matches the specification. An architect would have an ethical responsibility to report to the city something as major as PE panels going up on a rise rise tower, as public safety is the #1 priority of professionals. Ultimately, I would see the architect as the person to blame. If the architect didn't flag the problem at this step, I would put the blame on them since it's their job to approve products that meet code, and clearly the UK has good fire codes from what I've seen.
* City inspectors and the design team will review the installation during construction. There are often mockups, and the full project team is on site and involved.

It would be good to know where the failure happened. Was it the Architect? Engineer or other consultant? Code officials? General Contractor? Manufacturer? Lack of building code itself? Was the building code not followed? I'm guessing there is a chain of blame here. Often, the architect is responsible. They may not have consulted with the manufacturer, and made a major mistake. Without some investigation, I can only guess. PE panels are well known to be flammable, so I would tend to think this is more likely blame on the person who specified the panels to be used. I'm sure nobody is talking now, so we won't really know.

For a tower, generally NFPA 285 testing is required, which is documented in an ESR report or other test. In NYC for example, they are unique in having MEA numbers for materials. Does the UK have something equivalent? If not, that's ok, but I would be curious of how the process differs from NYC and other parts of the US. A quick google search gives me the MEA report for NYC for Reynobond. They clearly list Reynobond FR as approved for non-combustible construction. The architect should have caught this, since Reynobond is a global company and likely distributes similar literature worldwide. I can't believe they don't have similar documentation in the UK from local product representatives of Reynobond. Whether or not this exists, globally architects should know the difference in PE and FR.

Below is the ESR report for Reynobond. This is the report that shows code compliance in the US for IBC Section 1407, and design professionals regularly consult ESR reports as one source of code compliance. They should have something similar in the UK I would guess. This report clearly lists the limitations on Type I-IV construction. Reynobond is a big player in composite panels, I won't believe this info wasn't available for use, I bet the architect is going to get a lot of blame here.

This is a somewhat complicated and technical issue, and your article leaves more questions than answers. It also shows you have very little knowledge on MCM panels and the construction process, and you need an expert to help you.

I want to make this point too: building codes are provided as a MINIMUM legal requirement. What's more important is the current understanding and practice in the construction industry in a given locality. London architects not only have building codes, but access to a lot of good information on fire testing from the Fire Protection Association, and these days it's so easy to get fire testing information online; there is no excuse. At this point, I see little reason to blame politicians, unless you just wanted an excuse to blame politicians for something.",True,False,0,1498872358,,1498908573,2,djmojm3,t3_6kgc3x,t3_6kgc3x,1499808128,530,False,IAmA,t5_2qzb6,

Of course that proved foolish, as in March 1939 the remaining Czech lands were incorporated into Germany as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. This was done as a reaction to the devolving situation in Czechoslovakia, as the Slovaks declared independence as a German puppet state, which Hitler used as justification for occupying the Czech regions.

Totally unrelated to what I was studying: Finance and investments. I asked the Director for some real work later in the summer and we were arranging for it up until we realized I wasn't allowed to because I was on a student visa.

I'm not sure the Judge is anyone or anything in particular. From what I understand he's McCarthy's invention and doesn't appear in the source material. On a first reading I saw him as a way of representing European civilization in a context where human existence was basically prehistoric and almost ape-like. Not only is he a reminder of the civilized mode of life happening somewhere else, but he's also a reminder that all these horrific things the company does have the blessing of ""civilized"" people. 

The Judge represents all the highest achievements of European culture--science, history, law, music, art. It feels a bit incongruous that he should so blithely commit these acts of ruthless violence, but of course Caesar and Napoleon are just as integral to European culture as Beethoven or Darwin. Good and evil comfortably coexist in one hairless giant. That's sort of my take on the Judge in a nutshell, but I think McCarthy is too good a writer to make the Judge so easy to pin down.

I'm always conflicted about names. I consider them to be one of the least important things about a character in terms of concept, but at the same time they can add a lot to an initial impression and general flair.

So here's my exploration process for creating neat names with a given input:

From the Aramaic, Bartholomew means ""Son of Tolmai"", or ""Tolmai's Son"" in the correct order of the roots.

The root ""son"" from Aramaic can mean ""to create"" in Hebrew, which makes a certain sense. Also ""to cut down"", but that's less inspirational.

Now, ""Tolmai"" in the Aramaic is apparently from ""Ptolemy"", the Greek name, and maybe some Biblical figure(s) as well (Tolmai might also mean something like ridge or furrow, but how boring is that?). Ptolemy comes from an Ancient Greek root and essentially means war or battle.

Googling tells me that lazy click-baiting name-meaning sites stop exploring the name Bartholomew at ""Son of Tolmai"", but a more correct rendition might be along the lines of ""Son of Battle"", or in the correct order of the roots, ""Battle-Son"".

So, given that the name Bartholomew is ultimately from an Afroasiatic language, with Greek (Indo-European) influence, let's convert those roots into something else entirely.

Basque is a language with no apparent relationship to any other known language. Sounds like a plan.

In Basque the words for ""war"" and ""battle"" both appear to be influenced by Spanish, so I went with the Basque for ""fight"", ""borroka"". ""Son"" is ""samea"", while child is ""haur"". Per Google the direct translation of ""fight-child"" is ""borroka-umea"".

So we've got some potential names, ""borroka samea"", ""borroka haur"", and ""borroka-umea"". We're talking about an Elven name, right, so get rid of those harsh consonants:

Boa samea

Boa aur

Boa umea


Then freely rearrange and anagram them so they don't sound like garbage, my first thought being ""boa"" = ""oba"". Ultimately, through a lot of rearranging, here's my suggestion:

Obaur (derived from the middle option, pronounced oh-bar)

In a certain sense it has the same meaning as ""Bartholomew"", and even has a vaguely similar sound to it.

,inmynothing,,,"From the *Wall Street Journal* (bolded text is new, significant information):

***
&gt;WASHINGTON—A longtime Republican activist who led an operation hoping to obtain Hillary Clinton emails from hackers listed senior members of the Trump campaign, including some who now serve as top aides in the White House, in a recruitment document for his effort.

&gt;The activist, Peter W. Smith, named the officials in a section of the document marked “Trump Campaign.” The document was dated Sept. 7, 2016. That was around the time Mr. Smith said he started his search for 33,000 emails Mrs. Clinton deleted from the private server she used for official business while secretary of state. She said the deleted emails concerned personal matters. She turned over tens of thousands of other emails to the State Department.

&gt;As reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Smith and people he recruited to his effort theorized the deleted emails might have been stolen by hackers and might contain matters that were politically damaging. He and his associates said they were in touch with several groups of hackers, including two from Russia they suspected were tied to the Moscow government, in a bid to find any stolen emails and potentially hurt Mrs. Clinton’s prospects.

&gt;Mr. Smith’s purpose in listing the officials isn’t clear. There is no indication in the document that he sought or received any coordination from the campaign officials or the campaign in general.

&gt;Mr. Smith died in mid-May at age 81, about 10 days after he spoke to the Journal. He said he operated independently of the Trump campaign.

&gt;**Officials identified in the document include Steve Bannon, now chief strategist for President Donald Trump; Kellyanne Conway, former campaign manager and now White House counselor;** Sam Clovis, a policy adviser to the Trump campaign and now a senior adviser at the Agriculture Department; and retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, who was a campaign adviser and briefly was national security adviser in the Trump administration.

&gt;Mr. Bannon said he never met with Mr. Smith or anyone affiliated with a limited-liability company, KLS Research LLC, that the document said had been established for its mission. “Never heard of KLS Research or Peter Smith,” Mr. Bannon said.

&gt;Ms. Conway said she knew Mr. Smith from Republican politics but hadn’t spoken to him in years. “I never met with him” during the campaign, Ms. Conway said. “There were no calls, no meetings, no nothing.”

&gt;The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did the Agriculture Department, Mr. Clovis’s employer.

&gt;Mr. Flynn, his consulting firm Flynn Intel Group and his son Michael G. Flynn, who was chief of staff at Flynn Intel, were cited more extensively as Mr. Smith sought to recruit researchers, as well as in documents related to the effort that have been described to the Journal. Neither Mr. Flynn nor his son responded to requests for comment.

&gt;The names of the other campaign officials haven’t surfaced in connection with Mr. Smith’s work except in the document, which the Journal reviewed on Friday.

&gt;**The document section that lists campaign officials is followed by the words, “in coordination to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure.”—a possible reference to campaign strictures imposed by campaign finance and disclosure laws.**

&gt;The document was included in a package of opposition research Mr. Smith shared through an encrypted email with Matt Tait, a cybersecurity expert who once worked for British intelligence. Mr. Tait said he was approached last summer by Mr. Smith, who wanted him to help verify whether emails offered to the group by hackers came from Mrs. Clinton’s private serve.

&gt;After discussing his project by phone and in emails Mr. Smith gave him a document called the “KLS research packet,” which contained articles Mr. Smith planned to use for opposition research, Mr. Tait said. The packet cover sheet is the document that listed the Trump campaign officials. Mr. Smith’s name and phone number are typed at the bottom of it.

&gt;Mr. Smith asked Mr. Tait to sign a nondisclosure agreement. Mr. Tait said he declined and ceased communications with Mr. Smith, never reviewing any purported Clinton emails.

&gt;The document Mr. Smith presented to Mr. Tait, which he kept, is titled, “A Demonstrative Pedagogical Summary to be Developed and Released Prior to November 8, 2016,” which was Election Day.

&gt;It cites as the “preferred vehicle” for the effort a limited-liability company established in Delaware. Mr. Smith established KLS Research as that vehicle on Sept. 2, according to incorporation documents.

&gt;The House Intelligence Committee and its counterpart in the Senate are investigating Russian election meddling and whether there was coordination with the Trump campaign. So is Special Counsel Robert Mueller. President Trump has denied any collusion. The Russian government has denied it tried to interfere.

&gt;U.S. investigators have examined reports from intelligence agencies that tell of Russian hackers discussing how to get emails from Mrs. Clinton’s server and transmit them to Mr. Flynn via an intermediary, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence. It isn’t clear who the intermediary might have been or whether Mr. Smith’s operation was the one allegedly under discussion by the Russian hackers.

&gt;Mr. Smith said in the May interview he had assembled a group of technology experts, lawyers and a Russian-speaking investigator based in Europe to acquire emails his group theorized might have been stolen from Mrs. Clinton’s private server.

&gt;He said that after vetting batches of emails offered to him by hacker groups last fall, he couldn’t be sure enough of their authenticity to leak them himself and told the hackers to give them to WikiLeaks.

&gt;WikiLeaks has never published such emails or claimed to have them. In a statement to the Journal, it said, “WikiLeaks has never revealed a source and never will.”

,ferrarifan,,Certified Bootlicker,"&gt; I honestly don't understand why people care so strongly about the 2nd Amendment.

Because it's what separates us from the rest of the world. It gives power to the people. I'm insanely right-wing, but if there's one thing I like about Marx, is that he was pro-gun and pro-militia. The fact that citizens can arm themselves, means that they can be prepared to fight an oppressive tyrannical ruling class (be it the bourgeoisie or a commie government). What I don't understand, is why liberals aren't avid gun owners given how much they think Republicans are ruining America. It's about resistance, and I'm passionate about that. I know that it's an unlikely scenario, but who knows. Nazism wasn't that long ago, and neither was Stalinism. One day we might need them here in America.

In practice, you're right, a lot of people own guns for leisure. But they also own guns for self defense. Do you know how humiliating and scary it must be to live in a country where you can get raped/mugged/assaulted/robbed without having the fucking right to defend yourself. In Europe/SA there's this constant threat and fear of walking alone at night, or going places alone. I lived a good amount of time outside of the US, and one thing that other American citizens have always told me, is how they dislike the fact that you're always in peril. Despite what liberal fear mongering says, the US is one of the *safest* places to live (outside of Democrat ruled cities of course).

&gt; Why don't people get as upset when their 4th or 8th Amendment rights are eroded?

Great point. I absolutely agree, but there's a valid reason for that.

The 1A and 2A are the amendments that *protect* the constitution. Resistance to a tyrannical government comes in two forms/phases:

1. Protest (1A)

2. Revolution (2A)

The other amendments serve more as normal limitations of the federal government. That's why conservatives (and a lot of liberals) are 1A/2A absolutists. Sure, the 4th and 8th are also important to keeping tyranny away, but not *as essential* as the fist and second.

Also, a quick note, I'm super pissed at *both* parties for the way they've treated the 4th amendment. Republicans use ""muh terrorism"" as an excuse, and the Democrats think that the government can do whatever it pleases. This is something that isn't a big talking point, but is actually causing divide inside the parties, namely between the the establishment and grassroots.",True,False,0,1498875676,,False,0,djmqv1n,t3_6kiga4,t1_djmq6uu,1499809291,21,False,ShitPoliticsSays,t5_2vcl0,

[Take a look at this study](http://phenix.it-sudparis.eu/jct/doc_end_user/current_document.php?id=9089) or other similar ones.  My own testing resulted in similar results which is why I favor HEVC when practicable.

In this study, they created an 11 grade MOS scale (mean opinion score) where 0 = denotes a quality of reproduction that has no similarity to the original. A worse quality cannot be imagined. And 10 denotes a quality of reproduction that is perfectly faithful to the original. No further improvement is possible.

They then plotted the scores on graphs showing the bit rate necessary to achieve a MOS level for both AVC and HEVC.

You'll see that in each graph there's no overlap (point at which the quality:bit rate ratio is equal, nor is there any underlap (point at which AVC outperforms HEVC.

So regardless of whether or not you're compressing video so much that it's barely recognizable, or compression to the point where there's no perceivable difference from the source, the minimal data rate to reach that level *always* favors HEVC, and the difference is significant even on the high end.

The only time there would be overlap and the data rate would be the same would be if you're not using the minimal most data rate required, but instead, overkilling.  If for example, you could achieve no perceivable quality different from the source using HEVC at 80mbps, and AVC required  100mbps to achieve that quality level, then encoding both at anything above 100mbps is going to result in the same quality to bit rate ratio.  

However, I'm not sure how useful or relevant that could ever be.

Long ago the powerful sorcerer Clow Reed wandered Europe making a name for himself as a great magician and fortuneteller. His greatest feat of magic was the creation of the Clow Cards, a deck of 52 sentient cards each with a different power within. At the end of his life, Clow set in motion plans for a successor to inherit the cards and become their new master. Ages later, the book containing the Clow Cards found itself in the basement of the Kinomoto family. Upon discovering the book and cards, young Sakura Kinomoto inadvertently released the seal, sending the cards out into the world. Ultimately, Sakura reclaimed all 52 cards and earned the right to not only become their new master but reincarnated the cards under her own name and magic.

,Sepahani,,,"With questions such as these (e.g. there are many similar questions regarding homosexual sex with children in ancient Greece), you have to understand some things before approaching the topic:

In antiquity, marriage was not about love, but primarly about wealth, offspring and power.
What we today consider incestuous marriages actually were practiced to various degrees in almost all Indo-European societies (e.g. Romans, Greeks, Iranians, etc.) and some non-Indo European societies (e.g. Jews, Babylonians, etc.). It was by no means an exclusively Iranian / Zoroastrian phenomenon. If you study ancient civilisations and tribes, you will find many customs which we today would not comprehend.
In 95% of the cases, incestuous marriages were reserved for the ruling elite (aristocracy) and perhaps the clergy, as they had the greatest need to keep their wealth in their dynasty. Therefore, you will find cases of incest in several acient kings’ and emperors’ families across cultures, while the average peasant most probably did not perform this kind of marriage (bear in mind that e.g. in ancient Persia, these types of marriage were prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of people).
As for xwedodah (the Zoroastrian case) in particular, it is unclear what the precise meaning / context of the term in the Avesta was. Later documents (written by priests) are more elaborate, but may be later interpretations that suited the needs of the ruling elites. In later times, xwedodah was understood as marriage between cousins — again, the meaning had changed.
While there may have been incestuous marriages, most forms of xwedodah were probably symbolic (e.g. marrying your dead father) and served as a means to keep the wealth in the family.
In general, bear in mind that TODAY’S taboos are the result of social construction over centuries. In ancient Greece, homosexuality (and paedophilia, for that matter) was not only okay, but encouraged. Later, homosexuality was considered a sin. The same applies for incest in various cultures and many other social norms.
Thus, to answer your question of WHY Zoroastrianism allows incest marriages, it can be said that incest marriages were primarily later codified by priests (Zarathustra and the Avesta do not mention incest, but later priestly epistles discuss the topic), and that they served a social function (allocation of wealth for the elites) and were probably not common outside the top few percent of the society.

From a psychological point of view, I even doub’t that cases of close incest were common in any layer of society anywhere in the world, except if e.g. siblings were separated at birth. There is an evident psychological barrier to engage in sexual activity with people who you grew up with as children (research findings based on Israeli Kibutzim clearly showed this).",True,False,0,1498876585,,False,0,djmri0e,t3_6kjcv5,t1_djmqv6z,1499809600,7,False,iran,t5_2qhzq,

No niego que lo que le pasó no haya sido influenciado por sus investigaciones,pero lo cierto es que el CONICET está lleno de gente garca y es más probable que lo hayan querido cagar por cuestiones profesionales/personales que por los resultados de su investigación. 

No es algo raro que te serruchen el piso por envidia o porque tu jefe lo miró feo al otro jefe hace 80 mil años. 

Por otro lado,si buscan algo de literatura científica de los últimos años está lleno de papers acerca de los daños que genera el glifosato en distintos organismos. No es algo novedoso. Pero muchas veces las dosis que se usan en los estudios son mucho más altas de las que se han reportado en ambientes naturales.  Por otro lado,lo que también es cierto es que el principio activo del roundup (es decir,el glifosato en si mismo) presenta baja toxicidad en los ensayos que se llevan a cabo para determinar su efecto sobre seres vivos no blanco. El problema es que las formulaciones comerciales contienen otros componentes que son mucho más tóxicos que el principio activo (esto se ha comprobado en repetidas ocasiones). Por desgracia (o fortuna,según quien lo mire), los ensayos para determinar la toxicidad  del herbicida que realizan los organismos regulatorios se hacen sobre el principio activo,no sobre el formulado (cuya fórmula es secreto comercial). 

Por otro lado,lo que dice el artículo de la iarc es noticia vieja. Es cierto que ellos lo clasificaron como ""posible carcinogeno para seres humanos"". Pero la comunidad Europea solicito una revisión de los resultados del informe de la iarc y llegaron a la conclusión de que faltaban datos para hacer esa aseveración. Esos son los HECHOS. Después podemos discutir el lobby que haya hecho monsanto y otras empresas productoras de herbicidas a base de glifosato para modificar esa clasificación. Ahora estoy en móvil y no tengo las citas a mano,cuando tenga acceso a la pc las adjunto. 

Por otro lado,les comento que posiblemente antes de fin de año se publiquen los resultados del primer estudio transversal realizado por la UBA/CONICET acerca del impacto del glifosato y ciertos plaguicidas ampliamente utilizados sobre la población humana y el ambiente de ciertas regiones de la Argentina.

The Movies is a business simulation game created by Lionhead Studios for Microsoft Windows and subsequently ported to Mac OS X by Feral Interactive. It was released on 8 November 2005 in North America, and 11 November 2005 in Europe after reaching gold status on 8 October 2005. The game allows players to take the role of a Hollywood film mogul, running a studio and creating films. Much has been made about the film-making aspect of the game, as it allows players to easily create viewable works or machinima.

To make an analogy: if the ancient Mesopotamians, among the first peoples to come together to form urbanized population centres, had had the nuclear arsenal of modern-day Russia *and nothing else*, then they could easily render humiliated all of the world's armies from the early 1900s, gunpowder and all.

&gt; EU leaders have made clear that they will not lift the sanctions against Russia until the implementation of the Minsk 2 peace accord, brokered by the leaders of France and Germany and agreed by Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.

Just as the fact that I don't have the traits of a carnivore or an omnivore means it's immoral for me to eat meat. Humans, just like all other herbivores, die from high cholesterol because it clogs up your veins and kills you. A trait no carnivore has. We also have a lot of other herbivore traits, like a very high gut line to torso ratio, teeth that aren't equipped to tear flesh off, hands instead of claws, and the inability to expel meat before it spoils in our guts ect. That to me is the one single argument that trumps anything else in the debate about whether or not it's moral to eat meat. It doesn't matter what your value system is, what kind of moral reasoning you use, or if you walked the chicken on the beach over looking a sunset before slitting it's throat open. If you eat meat, mother nature doesn't give a flying fuck how you morally justify it. You'll still suffer a shortened life span along with whatever diseases your dietary choices bare out. And I carry that same logic when it comes to cheese. There are traits within me that mother nature endowed me with that allow me to eat and consume cheese. And yes, I know cheese still has cholesterol, hence why I monitor my intake to ensure I'm not allowing the progression of atherosclerosis and doing things to lower my cholesterol levels. Like regularly exercising and eating plenty of fiber. Both of which help prevent not only atherosclerosis, but also diabetes which is caused by the exact same thing, cholesterol.

,Clingers,notoriousbig,,"So happy with this man, this is easily up there with his best, surpassing anything he's done since American Gangster and perhaps superior to that too, though I think it's a little early. 

Enjoy the themes of black empowerment, social issues, self reflection and sort of looking over the rap game. What's so great is the conciseness of the album, 10 tracks with no weak links or lacklustre bars/production/anything. 4:44 is definitely the track I'm enjoying the most, you can feel how raw and emotional it is through the pain in his voice - ordinarily I don't ever feel emotional listening to music and I've never really grasped how people can start crying over songs but I did feel pretty emotional during that track tbh, especially after the last verse, which is one of the best on the album, about worries concerning when his kids will find out. 

Lyrics are great, laced with the double entendres that typifies Jay. Stuff like ""I said, ""Perhaps I Freudian slipped in European whips/ God sent me to break the chain"" or ""I still mourn this death, I apologize for all the stillborn /Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it"". Production is absolutely stellar with the glorious samples. I'm finding it hard to say something negative about the album lol, obviously it being longer would be nice however that might take away from what's so good about the album. Tracks like 4:44, Smile, The Story of OJ and Marcy Me could easily go down as some of Jay's best. Overall this can definitely take that #4 spot in the discography and it's slowly becoming my favourite album this year.

The Economist also wasn't on Krugman's side. Are they globalist shills? Krugman was heavily criticized for his positions on EU fiscal crisis (""confidence fairy"", really? This term is heterodox New School bullshit ideology, not actual economics). He's been wrong before, many times. For instance, I was in Latin America in '10 when he made an article saying Brazil's economy was doing great and any worry about it was unjustified. Incumbent party used this piece in their campaigning for reelection vigorously.  Every major economist who deals with Latin America knew he was wrong. Fast forward a couple years and the country enters it's deepest depression on record... because of public deficit. By the way, Krugman was against TPP. Nobody's perfect. 

It's laughable when you try to parallel counter-measures to the great recession in the US with the european debt crisis. If only reality was that simple. You can't solve problems of solvency without addressing the absurd, unjustified and irresponsible fiscal policy Greece had.

First three days were heavily planned, after that was freeform. 

First three days were a blast full of great sights and exploring and sweet food.

Hostels full up fast, and hotels don't always speak your language, trains are often late, and stores close at strange times.

Sure, there was some unplanned sweet things - eating fresh fruit at a dock market, finding a famous artwork at a church I didn't know was in that town - seeing the sunset over a mountain - 


but it was FAR overshadowed by stress and worry and at times straight up fear because we ended up without a place to sleep at night, or we got off at the wrong train station and everything was closed and it was the last train and there's no food - vending machines aren't even lit, and it's in the middle of the mountains and there's a group of rowdy yelling people approaching in the dark.

My home country is a poor struggling corpse of a place. From the slums to capital city itself, everything I've ever seen of it and everything I've heard of how it operates reflects a place where I can't imagine I would be able to progress. 

People don't get paid on time, they often don't get paid in full. And these are people with degrees, working full time. There are shortages in food, water, electricity. All of this even in the capital city.

&gt; Best thing is to wait until you hear from your uni. Also you should think of the reasons WHY you failed this year. Is it something that would keep hindering you in the future as well?

I've been trying to figure that out and I'm struggling to find answers. I've never been a particularly diligent or hard working person in academia. Anyone who's worked with me in most out of school situations would probably agree that I have a very good work ethic.

That's one of the reasons why I love the part time job I have right now in fact. I enjoy going there and working hard to do a good job and provide a good service. 

It's just that for some reason I've never been able to replicate it for school. 

I think maybe the issue lies in a bit of ego. I *think* I'm fairly smart, and so quite often I 'logic' my way into not doing things. I don't go to lectures because I know they're recorded and I *could* watch them at home. I don't go to lectures because I have a history of falling asleep in them so it would be a waste of time.

I somehow manage to talk myself into stupid decisions using logic that makes just enough sense for me to buy into it.

I have absolutely no idea how I could fix an issue like that. I think I could and would pass if I tried again because when the pressure really gets on me I do much better.

According to that wikipedia page: 

The process of creating elongated coins is legal in the United States, almost all parts of Japan[citation needed], South Africa and parts of Europe. In the United States, U.S. Code Title 18, Chapter 17, Section 331 prohibits ""the mutilation, diminution and falsification of United States coinage."" The foregoing statute, however, does not prohibit the mutilation of coins, if the mutilated coins are not used fraudulently, i.e., with the intention of creating counterfeit coinage or profiting from the base metal (the pre-1982 copper U.S. cent which, as of 2010, is worth more than one cent in the United States).[7] Because elongated coins are made mainly as souvenirs, mutilation for this purpose is legal.

In the UK, the Coinage Act of 1971, Section 10 states: ""No person shall, except under the authority of a licence granted by the Treasury, melt down or break up any metal coin which is for the time being current in the United Kingdom or which, having been current there, has at any time after 16th May 1969 ceased to be so."".[8] As the process of creating elongated coins does not require them to be melted nor broken up, however, Section 10 does not apply and coin elongation is legal within the UK with penny press machines a common sight at tourist attractions across the nation.[9]

In countries where such mutilation is illegal, such as Canada, blank planchets, slugs, or U.S. cents are occasionally used, though this law is often ignored both by the users of the machine and law enforcement.",True,False,0,1498886255,,False,0,djmxh0g,t3_6khy2j,t1_djmonnb,1499812533,3,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,

The 2017 [Hearthstone Championship Tour](http://eu.battle.net/hearthstone/esports/)'s second seasonal championship takes players and fans to the bustling metropolis of [Shanghai, China](http://eu.battle.net/hearthstone/blog/20721377/). Sixteen players from around the globe have earned their spot in the [HCT Spring Championship ](http://eu.battle.net/hearthstone/esports/tournament/hct-spring-championship-2017)to compete for their share of the $250,000 prize pool and a seat at the Hearthstone World Championship. Choose Your Champion also returns — pick your favorite competitor and cheer them on throughout the tournament for a chance at in-game rewards! Spring Championship details including the participants, casters, schedule, and more can be found below.

### **Choose Your Champion**

You can once again root for one of the 16 competitors as they compete in the Spring Championship and be rewarded with card packs based on how well they perform!

These champions represent the Americas, Asia-Pacific, China, and Europe, and hope to represent their home region at the Hearthstone World Championship.

**[Champion Groups](http://eu.battle.net/hearthstone/esports/tournament/hct-spring-championship-2017)**

Simply click the button below to choose a champion to cheer for — but remember, **you cannot change your selection once you have chosen**!

**[Choose Now!](http://www.battle.net/hearthstone/esports/tournament/hct-spring-championship-2017/choose-your-champion)**

Just for participating, you will receive one card pack from [Journey to Un’Goro](http://eu.battle.net/hearthstone/expansions-adventures/journey-to-ungoro/). You will receive one additional card pack from Journey to Un’Goro each time your champion advances — to the quarterfinals, semifinals, or finals.

Each match will be best-of-five using the [Conquest format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hfGtSMPUMg) with one class ban, so each player must bring four decks.

Groups were seeded based on Hearthstone Competitive Points, with the top point earner from each region placed in their own group, and the remainder of the group filled in based on the order of the players’ regional seeds.

The Spring Championship takes place July 7 to 9, observing the following schedule:

+ July 7 at 10:00 a.m. China Standard Time (July 7 at 04:00 CEST) – Group Stages

,stevejazzx,,,"They never got attacked is the bit you're missing. 
You are also missing the fact that Ukraine is not in NATO. 
The sequence of events is quite simple and will be borne out in history. 
Putin who backed an increasingly corrupt Yanukovych had tried to wrangle a deal between Ukraine and EU where both Russia and EU would supply financial aid to Ukraine. 
With the exception of the US All parties at the time, (December 2013) were in favour of this arrangement. A second round of negotiations agreed that Yanukovych had to go and that Ukraine would get a New Democratically elected leader. 
 The US had already began a plan to integrate Ukraine to NATO. They had also decided that Ukraine could not remain in Russia's sphere of influence. 
The thinking here was simple - Before sanctions Russia's success at expanding its sphere of influence was growing by the year with energy and currency deals happening globally, notably with China, India and Brazil and even Iran and so leaving Ukraine in their grasp scuppered not only future energy deals in the region but also NATOs effectiveness. 

So For the US Stage 2 after the 91' victory (fall of the USSR) was to remove any remaining soviet satellite countries and of course infiltrate and remove Ukraine from Russia's grip. 

Having funded 'democracy' projects in Ukraine since early 90's they dabbled with widespread election interference  in 2004; the so called Orange Revolution. The Russians managed to keep that one together and ultimately prosper. 
However the sizeable 5billion disclosed investment that US was spending in Ukraine was finally to see a pay off in 2014. 

The US had set up (as part of NED) 'not for profit' agencies and centres whose purpose was to promote change in Ukraine. 
These centres distributed materials directly and via the press in order to spur on an 'organic' desire within the Ukrainian population for radical change. 

With a possible deal between Ukraine, Russia and EU looming the US had to work fast to stop it. 
Victoria Nuland can be heard saying 'f**k the eu' in the famous leaked phone call because of this deal. Incidentally she also discusses with 100% accuracy who will be Ukraines unfortunate interim leader (Yats).  It's not possible to hear this leaked phone call and imagine the US was acting normally - they were clearly manipulating the democratic process in Ukraine at the time. 

Anyways back to early 2014 and soon Yanukovych will be accused of using snipers something which will spur on protests in Maidan and ultimately lead to a whole host of illegal events including the ousting of Yanukovych and the creation of a new interim government. 

Putin seeing how the US was intent on not allowing any further Russian involvement in Ukraine ordered his permanently stationed Crimean troops to take over the place. A bloodless coup lasting less than a day. 
The Crimeans who are 65-70% ethnically Russian had already voted in the 90's and early 2000s to rejoin with Russia. (The Ukrainian born soviet leader Kruschev having given Ukraine administrative governance over Crimea in the 50's). 

The heavily Russian leaning east and of course Crimea were never attacked by Russia. In fact they are mostly Russian areas so that is a non sequitur they are effectively on the same side, historically and genetically! 
The west of Ukraine now under new management started a civil war with the east to which Russia appears to have been heavily involved and illegally so - nonetheless the sequence of events is clear.

The safety of aspartame has been studied extensively since its discovery with research that includes animal studies, clinical and epidemiological research, and postmarketing surveillance. Aspartame is one of the most rigorously tested food ingredients. Peer-reviewed comprehensive review articles and independent reviews by governmental regulatory bodies have analyzed the published research on the safety of aspartame and have found aspartame is safe for consumption at current levels. Aspartame has been deemed safe for human consumption by over 100 regulatory agencies in their respective countries, including the UK Food Standards Agency, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and Health Canada.

,hillsonghoods,moderator,Moderator | 20th Century Pop Music | History of Psychology,"Firstly, writers in antiquity often thought in terms of natural 'sympathies' and 'antipathies' between various materials and indeed creatures. Some things were attracted to each other, and others were repelled - e.g., one belief was that man and wolf had antipathies, and would avoid each other.

One specific set of these sympathies and antipathies that writers in antiquity discussed, unsurprisingly, was magnets. It was believed that rubbing garlic on a magnet would stop it from working, while rubbing lambs' blood would make it work again.  Remember that this is before Newton and/or the the modern acceptance of atoms - before the 'Scientific Revolution', educated people lived in a world where things were mysterious, where everything in the world felt purposeful. In this world, magnets moved, seemingly, because of hidden, magical forces. And, I mean, [magnets have also seemed quite magical to more recent scholars of metaphysics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-agl0pOQfs).

These beliefs about antipathy and sympathy lasted a long time amongst the educated; even Rene Descartes - who famously thought that animals were mechanical - believed there were antipathies between wolf skin and lamb skin. To give an example, Wootton discusses a 1589 edition of a then-popular book by Giambattista della Porta called *Natural Magick*, where della Porta complains that neither garlic or lambs' blood actually had any effect on magnets despite what the ancients said (della Porta probably plagiarised this from a manuscript by Garzoni, but that's another story). The della Porta book is famous for his complaint about magnets being an early example of someone complaining about writers from antiquity getting things wrong. But in general *Natural Magick* is otherwise a pretty good clue to how people in the 16th century thought magnets worked: we're talking about a book with the word 'Magic' in the title here. For della Porta, magnetism was still a mysterious, magical force that worked via sympathies and antipathies. So the obvious belief about compasses that would have been held by many was that compasses felt a *sympathy* for the north pole of the Earth.

However, writers in antiquity hadn't written much about magnets and how they work, and so magnets were a topic that late Medieval writers felt it was worth trying to add new knowledge to. So in 1269 you get Pierre de Maricourt, relatively shortly after the introduction of compasses to Europe, writing about the principles of the poles of magnets and how to magnetise metal; de Maricourt seems to have been the first person in Europe, at least, to discuss such things in extant writing.

Sebastian Cabot in 1522 discovered that compasses do not point to true north and that the point they do point to varies somewhat, which was problematic for the idea that compasses worked by sympathy to the north pole; the inaccuracy there suggested a less cosmic solution. In 1581 William Gilbert, after replicating the observations of della Porta and de Maricourt, argued that compasses worked on the same principles as regular magnets, and that the Earth was a big magnet (i.e., that it had a magnetic field).

In terms of societal resistance, Jesuits certainly argued against Gilbert from a pre-Copernican point of view, because Gilbert's work on magnets and compasses had a worldview fundamentally different to the traditional Ptolemaic model of the heavens that they taught. In fact, the only reason we have still have a copy of the Garzoni manuscript that della Porta apparently plagiarised is that the manuscript was kept in the archive of Jesuits trying to argue against Gilbert. Of course, Jesuit disapproval wouldn't have hurt Gilbert - after all, he was the personal physician to Elizabeth I, who perhaps wasn't the greatest fan of Jesuits what with her being head of a church that wasn't the Catholic one. There were certainly also English people who disagreed with Gilbert about magnets - Francis Bacon thought Gilbert was making way too much of his evidence, and the dons of Cambridge and Oxford generally ignored the new natural philosophy of the likes of Gilbert for centuries in favour of traditional ways of thinking about the world. But clearly the societal resistance to Gilbert certainly didn't stop him from having a pretty prominent place in Elizabethan society.

Yeah definitely, our college system is one of our best assets and arguably the best in the world but it's being wasted when a vast majority of Americans can't afford to benefit from it.  And there's the public vs private comparison to Europe... look at the UK for example - technically there are far fewer ""private"" universities but that's just down to classification since most of the universities there are subsidized by government funds but operate privately. The British govt caps tuition for British students at 9000pounds across the board. That's the tuition for any British student attending any British university, even Oxford or Cambridge. Whereas, in America not only do we allow private colleges to price the education system beyond the masses, but even our best public colleges only subsidize tuition on a state level.  So the quality of our university system really becomes redundant when the cost  can only acommodate the wealthy or anyone willing to be in prolonged debt. 

I agree with you in terms of free college vs debt free college. I really wish Hillary had stuck to her initial platform cause free college is just unrealistic. At least we can address debt on a federal level.  

Like you said we should make college more affordable but beyond that we need to  go further - not just an universal pre-k plan - we need to drastically improve the quality of our high school education system which is shockingly poor compared to most countries.

Technically, the Red Eclipse is the biggest European server at the moment but T3-M4 takes the second place.

The GTN has a lot of items in every category so that would not be a problem. I've made billions there.

&gt; Is there a way to transfer all my toons or can i only do 1 toon for 90 cartel points each time only?

No. Each transfer is 90CC. But that's really not bad since they used to be 1000CC per character. Also, if you want, you can create a level 1 character with the same name on your destination server and when you transfer you get a free rename.

&gt; Is there a channel, for global chat like in WoW etc.?

Do you mean across factions? no. Across planets? not that I know of except forthe LFG, PvP, GSF and channels like that

&gt; Can i also transfer to a US server, and if yes will there be any disadvantages like lags?

Yes, you can also transfer to a US server but I do not see any reason to do that currently. The disadvantages would be that you'd have to pay 150CC instead of 90 per character since it's cross-region and also your ping would be around 120/200 for East/West coast respectively which would not affect PvE but PvP and GSF.

&gt; So will i only lose all items in the legacy bank or will i lose something else/more?

You will have to re-unlock all strongholds but you will only have to make the initial purchase. For example, if you have the Dromund Kaas stronghold fully unlocked you'd have to pay 5000 Credits on the new server and receive a fully unlocked stronghold. You will have to re-decorate everything though. 

Your legacy will be copied with all your achievements, unlocks and reputation. You should take all items out of the legacy storage, mailboxes and GTN though.

&gt; Is it free to transfer characters as suscriber?

No, it costs excactly the same amount.

There's this book, [""The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity

The article she's getting hate-mail over is kind of dumb. 

Firstly, what we call western civilization was unquestionably developed in countries populated almost entirely by white people. Who got so high on it that for a time they thought they were supposed to spread the benefits of it all around the world (so called ""White man's burden""). Fortunately, WWI intervened.  

Secondly, her conclusion (more diverse students in classicist courses) wouldn't help, bad ideas people have in regards to ancient world are courtesy of media, which ignores classicists and historians. (film-makers hire historians and then ignore any advice they don't like)

Thirdly, you probably need to ask yourself - is there any majority non-white country ruled by people who aren't white you'd feel comfortable moving to because it has 'western civilization' in it. That is, it resembles European countries in laws, habits, customs and the amount of chaos the government permits to happen. 

I don't think there really is one. Japan/Korea appear superficially western-like, but they're something entirely different.

How was refusing to fight showing incompetence when you know your enemy is superior in almost every way and they proved it against you years before and against the ""European Great Power"" Russia? It's amazing that they were able to fight against Japan for essentially five full years before direct foreign intervention followed after Pearl Harbor. 

That was probably the latest that the Japanese could've subjugated China, if they waited a few years, the KMT would've gotten it's house in order and have the economic and military buildup to go on the offensive in Manchuria themselves if not completely dissuade the Japanese from an invasion. You can take the parallel to the German invasion of the Soviet Union, they attacked at the best possible time they could have. If they waited until 1942, then you have a Soviet Union that has the time to fully consolidate it's recent territorial gains, recover from the purge and modernize it's forces along with a completed Molotov Line.

=========================================================================================================================================================

SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST

1.(C) In meetings May 10 and 11 with President Basescu, Foreign Minister Ungureanu and other officials of the Government of Romania (GOR), Assistant Secretary Maura Harty found no evidence that the GOR had specific plans or strong commitment to resolve pending cases of international adoption affected by the law in place since January 1 banning adoptions out of Romania. She informed her interlocutors she would have to share that impression with American families whose petitions to adopt Romanian children were affected by the ban. She reiterated to FM Ungureanu the message given by the Secretary during his meeting with her in Washington, that establishing a road map towards eventual inclusion of Romania in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program (VWP) would depend on progress towards resolving the pending cases.

2.(C) (Summary, cont,d.) After his meeting with A/S Harty, President Basescu appeared to have changed his mind and decided to take positive action on the issue. On May 12, he informed Charge d,Affaires that he had discussed the adoption issue with EU Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn on May 11; would instruct FM Ungureanu to write the EC expressing the desirability of putting in motion a process to resolve the cases; and that Romania would take the initiative to convince the Germans, Italians, French and others to wield their influence and urge the EC to view resolution of the cases favorably. End summary.

3.(C) Action Request: Per internal discussions during A/S Harty,s visit, post requests Department consideration of a letter from the Secretary to the European Commission urging the EC support humanitarian resolution of pending international adoption cases from Romania. End request.

COMMENT

24.(C) Post believes Basescu's May 12 statements indicate he took to heart A/S Harty's message and realized anew how seriously the USG takes resolution of the pending cases. His was the most forward-leaning commitment to action by the GOR leadership to date. Post will follow up with his advisors, the Prime Minister's office and the MFA in the coming days, and continue to discreetly explore with European embassy interlocutors possibilities for their engaging the EC and European Parliament to resolve pending adoptions. End comment.

**New Center in Romania to Aid Missing and Exploited Children | [ICMEC](http://archive.is/cdJQi) | JUN 19, 2007**  
============================================================================================================================ 

ALEXANDRIA, VA – June 19, 2007 – To combat the growing problem of missing and exploited children, including child trafficking and child prostitution, a new non-governmental organization (NGO), The Romanian Center for Missing and Exploited Children has opened in Bucharest, Romania.   

The new center will work closely with government, law enforcement, other non-governmental organizations, and the general public on cases involving and issues affecting missing and sexually exploited children and their families.  

The new center is a member of the global network that is being created by the U.S.-based International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC). The new Romanian Center was modeled after the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the U.S. and Child Focus in Belgium.   
Why Romania?

• The number of missing children reported missing in Romania has steadily increased from 244 in 2003, to 660 in 2004, to 750 in 2005.
• There are an estimated 100,000 homeless children throughout Eastern Europe, including 2,000 in Romania. Child trafficking and child prostitution are problems in Romania and represent a large threat throughout Eastern Europe. Homeless or “street” children are frequent victims. An estimated 5 percent of the homeless children in Romania are forced into child prostitution.
• An estimated 30% of sex workers in Bucharest are under 18 years of age. Romania, and in particular Bucharest, is one of the key travel destinations in Europe for child sex offenders.
• Romania is a country of origin and transit for women and girls who are internationally trafficked from Moldova, Ukraine, and other parts of the former Soviet Union to Asia, the Middle East and Europe. 
• Romania has the seventh largest population and the ninth largest territory in the European Union. It is the largest country in Southeastern Europe and the twelfth largest in all of Europe. Romania is not only a leader in shaping policies of Eastern Europe, but it now enjoys membership in the European Union.  

The new center was established through the leadership and efforts of Mihaela Geoana who will serve as the organization’s Chairman of the Board. Mrs. Geoana is a Board Member of the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC), and wife of the former Foreign Minister of Romania.  

The new Romanian Center will provide a variety of information and services for both law enforcement officials and the public, including the following:

• Operate a new 24-hour call center to receive and manage reports of missing and sexually exploited children;
• Establish networks within Romanian stakeholders who work to report and solve cases involving missing and sexually exploited children;
• Facilitate communications and coordination with similar centers throughout the world;
• Establish a system to monitor and track cases;
• Develop a national network of volunteers that will be trained and utilized in search operations;
• Provide technical assistance to professionals who interact with children and their families to be responsive to the special needs of victim children and their families;
• Increase public education and awareness about the issues of missing and exploited children through media campaigns, conferences, workshops and other events; and
• Establish a monitoring system to help prevent children from becoming victims of Internet child pornography.  

“The problems of child abduction and child sexual exploitation need to be addressed on a global basis. Creating regional and national centers similar to the new center in Romania is critical to eliminating the problems of child victimization,” said Ernie Allen, President and CEO of ICMEC. “There is no greater priority than protecting children and keeping them safe.”  

The new Romanian Center opened on May 25 – the day set aside around the world to remember missing children who have not yet been recovered and to celebrate those missing children who have been safely returned to their families. Funding for the new center will be through private donations, with special thanks to lead corporate donors, TOTAL and Microsoft Corporation.

But like /u/mushroomgodmat posted, I haven't seen a single person say they are shocked, only articles (whether satire or not) claiming that people are shocked.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

I think Spanish has re-regularized that a bit by differenciating between ser and estar, but I know neither Spanish nor Latin so maybe I'm wrong. In fact, I'm not a linguist, so all of this is just guess work.

As for *to have*, it's not so irregular, it seems more like it was basically regular but due to frequent usage, it was shortened through sloppy pronunciation. I mean, even if people started saying and spelling ""he haves"" today, I think in many situations, the v would just be dropped again for ease of pronunciation.

A Global Perspective on Religious Participation and Suicide.

Abstract:

&gt; Although sociological research in the Durkheimian tradition has generally accepted that religious involvement protects against suicide, few studies have examined this theoretical proposition outside Western industrialized settings. Using multilevel models to analyze data from the World Health Organization Mortality Database and the World Values Survey (1981–2007) across 42 countries in seven geographical-cultural regions, this study explores whether religious participation is more protective against suicide in some regions than others and, if so, why. Results indicate that while religious participation is protective in Latin America, eastern Europe, northern Europe, and English-speaking countries, it may aggravate the risk of suicide in East Asia, western Europe, and southern Europe. This regional variation is the result of differences in both the degree of integration/regulation of religious communities and suicide underreporting. Overall, the findings support the network perspective of Durkheim’s classical theory and suggest that researchers should be more cautious about suicide underreporting in less industrialized settings.",True,False,0,1498907480,,False,0,djn5c7v,t3_6kmfst,t3_6kmfst,1499816392,1,False,psychology,t5_2qhcz,

,uB166ERu,,,"You know it would be so much easier for the UK, if they would just accept freedom of movement for goods, services AND people. If like Switserland they would just allow EU citizens to come and work and live in the UK (in that order!) they would be able to leave the EU while keeping access to the single market. 

That would of course mean they will also need to pay for that access (like Switzerland), while having no say whatsoever on how the single market is shaped going forward. 

It would still be a worse deal than what the UK currently has. But at least the brexiteers would have their country back and could claim the UK is not actively participating in the further integration into the EU. They could just claim to be following the rules of the single market for trade reasons. They could feel proud of their 'independence' once again, and of their victory. 

Funny thing is, even if the UK go fully masochistic and would leave the single market entirely, and manage to get some kind of trade deal at the end of the day (in a decade or two), their products and services will still have to follow much of the same rules as they are currently following in order to be able to trade with the single market. 

The best Brexit is no Brexit, but that's never going to satisify the emotional reason why people voted to leave in the first place. So the Switzerland option is probably the best one, as Switzerland is also regarded as very independent, so it also sounds good and might satisfy the irrational nationalistic desires a bit.

,hilburn,,Human,"Guild Mages might stay in Nimre, but they aren't necessarily part of the university. The whole setup we've seen between clubs and guilds implies that they are considered separate. 

50% I think it's being generous. Sila is what? 50 years old? She not only had never been tested for magic, she'd never even really considered it, else she would know that only one person could use a mage stone. A long lifetime of not doing something doesn't increase your chances of doing it. 

There are other ways to detect Mages, there's at least a spell to do it, but that requires someone to cast it, and from what we've seen Mages stick to the cities and charge for their services which again puts it out of reach for people like Sila. 

We've met the prince, level 6 and young, and not in their club, leaving only 3 others unaccounted for. Assuming that they are ancient is a much bigger leap of logic than assuming they follow the rest of their peers. 

The comment about Adympia was simply that their mage population is not represented in the university. It doesn't matter if the 2% average includes them or not, though I personally think it's more likely to just be a flat 2%, only a small fraction of mages born there makes it to the university, so we have a population of a country roughly the size of France that we can't account for in estimates. 

I make assumption after assumption? I used the stated proportions from the author to show the population is *at least* that of modern Europe, and *likely* much more. It hits the European population without having to take into account imperfect  recruitment or loss to graduation - so really all your arguments against those two factors, although I consider them flawed, are moot anyway.

,illapa13,,,"How do I say this....you're wrong on a lot. The vast majority of battles for your stated time period of around 1400 and earlier in Europe at least were battles between Knights and their retainers and a levy of peasants versus basically the same thing on the other side. Okay let me break it down into multiple points.

1. Swords were not a common weapon on the battlefield. High quality steel was expensive and so the vast majority of soldiers or armed with spears, axes, or some polearm that is a combination of those two. In fact I could plausibly argue that for the majority of pre gunpowder human history the spear is the most Universal Weapon. Spears are easy for the untrained peasants to use and they are cheap for the nobility that is stuffing them into their Armory. In cases where peasants had to provide their own Spears they might be providing weapons as cheap as a fire hardened staff with a point without even metal.

2. Battles in the medieval period were far smaller than the Classical period and the early modern era that would come afterwards. Most of Europe use the system where Knights would have their retainers and they would do the bulk of the fighting. Each Village would provide a few extra Soldiers by collectively pulling their money together and giving that Soldier a decent amount of gear. When villagers themselves had to fight it wasn't pretty as they basically just had sharpened sticks and thick padding. Either way though most battles did not have rows of knights fighting rows of knights and most battles did have a substantial levy. Knights were 1% of the population and each night might have a few dozen retainers that were well-armed and decently armored. There for the majority of combatants especially Levy's might not even have armor or even a weapon Beyond a simple axe or cheap spear. In many European countries every family was required to provide at least one able-bodied man for that Year's campaign season. It did not matter how poor the family was or how unable they would be to make up for said man.

3. When you set up the economy would be ruined by grabbing lots of peasants you are both right and wrong. Peasants were needed to plant the crop and peasants were needed to harvest the crop. But in between spring and winter you have this nice convenient period of several months that farms can survive without a large amount of manpower and so this effectively became the campaign season where most battles took place. The nobility knew that keeping hazan's out in the field longer than this set. Of time would cause problems so they avoided it but that does not mean that it was never done. And again every family unit or every village was obliged to provide a minimum number of peasants as Infantry. There were really no excuses unless he wanted to pay huge fines or be basically raided by the nobility that supposedly protected you.

4. A man with a sword on the battlefield was a man to be feared. The spear, the axe, bows, and even the mace to appoint with hammers are weapons that are used for purposes other than just killing humans. There is an ancient Greek saying, ""cold was the man's heart who first forged the sword."" The sword is unique in human history because it is a weapon that evolved for the sole purpose of killing humans. You can't use a sword to hunt, cook, chop wood, or anything else other than killing another human. So if you were a peasant you had a shield a spear with a metal tip and a long knife and padded thick clothing (leather is expensive Hollywood is just infatuated with it) as armor. If you run into a guy that pulls out a sword on the battlefield he is most likely covered in armor plates and chainmail, and he most likely has a sword. At this point you would know that you were truly screwed. If he has a sword it means that he is a member of the military class and he has trained his entire life to use said sword for the sole purpose of killing you. You meanwhile have drilled once every summer in some practice field for a month a year and are probably absolutely terrified that you're even in a real battle. The guy you're fighting doesn't even have to be a knight he could just be a retainer it doesn't matter he is a professional soldier with the right and skills to wield a sword something that would cost you a ton of your wages to even buy. Forget the amount of time and training you would have to put into using a sword for it to be a viable weapon you've barely mastered thrusting and blocking with your spear. 

5. It was mentioned before the knight's primarily used lances and this is true that was their primary weapon. On foot they might use a poleaxe.  if they were deployed as Cavalry though they would most likely have a lance and sword. Other weapons might be used but a sword has longer reach and so it can be used while you are up on your horse to slash down on someone. Maces and axes are shorter than swords and so are more difficult to use from horseback. The sword is so much more than a weapon though. It is a status symbol. A sword is used saying that you are rich enough to be able to pay for a master swordsmith to make you this high-quality weapon. It is a weapon that has to be maintained every day and practiced with every day. You are announcing to the world that you are someone with extra time on his hands to practice swordsmanship.  You are not a peasant standing behind his shield with his you are not a peasant standing behind his shield with his thick padded cloth. You are a warrior in bright metal armor and heraldry as you are not trying to hide but announce to the world here I am this is who I am this is my reputation and I know what I'm doing. Despite what Hollywood says in the medieval period you could not have a sword unless you were a member of the middle or upper classes. Additionally having any sort of weapon on your possession that could kill a knight was either distasteful or flat-out illegal as the nobility did not want some peasant to kill them.

6. Plate armor was always rare. Plate is the most expensive of the most expensive armor and even Knights would have problems affording it. Most Knights could afford a solid metal chestplate and a solid metal helmet. The rest of their armor was a combination of individual plates and chainmail and a thick cloth gambeson underneath. If you were a peasant on the battlefield and you ran into someone in full plate armor you were not fighting some low Knight. You are fighting a Count or Duke or even a King and you have no chance in hell of surviving the next 5 seconds of your life as he is probably surrounded by the greatest Knights and richest most well-armed and trained nobility of your entire country all sworn to kill anyone who tries to harm them. This was war and no one was interested in a fair fight a peasant had more chance of being struck dead by lightning than he did of defeating a plate armored knight in a one-on-one battle.

TLDR:
1. High-quality swords were uncommon weapons for professionally trained soldiers and the nobility. Peasant levies were armed with cheap easy to learn spears and long knives or axes. Peasants also probably had a shield and thick padding as armor.

2. Even though battles during this time period were smaller than classical battles Knights and the nobility were 1% of the population the vast majority of combatants were peasant levies. 

3. Peasant levies were definitely possible and done throughout the entire world. Your economy was not ruined by calling up one man per family during summer when no one is needed for planting or harvesting.

4-5. Swords were not common but in fact were weapons of professional soldiers which was a rare thing in the medieval time period. If you had a sword in meant that you were either nobility or a retainer of the nobility. If you had a sword it was because you knew how to use it, you were honored to use it, and you would have no problems dispatching of a lowborn peasant in battle.

6. Plate armor was extremely rare and only afforded by the richest and most powerful nobility. Most nights could afford a solid metal chest plate, a solid metal helmet, and maybe some plates on his shoulders arms and shins, but their armor would have been a mixture of chainmail and plate. Full plate armor was for Dukes, Counts, Kings Etc and was unimaginably expensive. So even though plate armor was difficult to pierce with a sword it was not impossible to do it in the joints and most people would go through their entire lives never fighting someone with plate armor.

Long story short the sword is a professional weapon and one of the best weapons out there as far as killing humans goes.

I wish you good luck in your writing but please for the love of God do not have every single person with plate armor and every single person with a sword.

What's wrong with having a capitalist system with some elements of socialism?

It seems to me that an ideal society would be one where even the poorest and most in need can still get access to healthcare, and basic living essential like food, water, shelter, and clothing whilst those who are better off are free to earn more money if they want to, like in capitalism.

Actually, this is pretty common here in Europe. I can't speak for the rest of Europe, but here in the UK at least, it seems to have worked pretty well. We've had nationalised healthcare for ***everyone***, regardless of how rich or poor they are. We've had it since 1948 (hey, it'll be 69 years old on Wednesday!) We've also had some form of welfare system since about 1908 (started with pensions, and over time it now also supports jobseekers, disabled people, employed people who aren't earning much, as well as other areas).

Every time the Conservative party come into power, they seem to cut funding to the healthcare and welfare systems with seemingly no regard for anyone who's negatively affected by the cuts. Still, even now with the systems under so much strain from all the funding cuts, the UK seems to be far better off now than without them.

To be honest, the idea of boiling down system as complicated as a government down to a single word ""Capitalism"" or ""Socialism"" seems stupid. There are countless political ideologies that fall under capitalism, socialism, or somewhere in between. It seems to me to make more sense to look at a particular issue when it arises and use evidence and reason decide what the best way to solve that issue is, rather than to just automatically choose the ""Capitalist"" or ""Socialist"" way to deal with it because you consider yourself a capitalist or socialist. I feel like these ideologies (and others) can get in the way of actually running a country because politicians become too absorbed into their own utopian daydreams instead of paying attention to the facts and evidence they're being presented with in the real world.

I also feel like the whole ""Capitalism/Socialism is an evil system"" thing is incredibly harmful to debate for both sides.",True,False,0,1498910035,,False,0,djn68s0,t3_6kiara,t1_djms7vd,1499816835,8,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,

It's really easy, with SUPER light controls. I was surprised. The hard part about a bigger airplane is the reduced margin for error; you can eat up 10,000' of runway in a hurry in a 350,000# jet.

Well, based on the evidence we are. A greater percentage of under 30s are University educated with a good degree (2.1) than any other generation.

&gt;The Labour manifesto said it would limit EU immigration. That's not possible without leaving the single market.

You can be within the single market and still limit EU immigration. Plenty of EU governments have enacted strict policies and laws that severely limit EU immigration, the UK government since 1997 just refused to do so because they viewed it overall beneficial. For example transitional controls were used by other EU governments like Germany but the UK government decided not to have them, which would have delayed the movement of Eastern Europeans by several years.

This argument, made in the 1994 book *Selling God: American Religion in the Marketplace of Culture*, posits that because religion had to compete in the largely open marketplace of American culture, one way it successfully did so was to establish itself as a reactionary force against progress and social change, decrying such as debauchery or moral decay. This was seen especially strongly after the theories of Darwin gained traction (leading to hardcore biblical literalism) and in the 20th century with the growth of television and other media distractions (which they also leveraged with televangelists). Even today, groups like the Westboro Baptist Church have a following and stay relevant because of their antics and the attention drawn by such. 

While I don't think that the country should have had a state religion  as such, I wonder if the Founding Fathers could have foreseen the effects of this ""free-market"" approach to religion.

Si je trouvais une boite d'ici la c'était top mais dans le cas contraire j'aurais été contraint d'arrêter les études et commencer à travailler ( on vit correctement mais je ne pouvais pas me permettre de demander à mes parents de me payer ma future scolarité ).  
Et j'ai eu de la chance en effet, j'ai trouvé une boite deux semaines avant la deadline. Chose triste, les rôles se sont inversés avec mon pote, qui avait trouvé une entreprise en Octobre, a du démissionner car les missions qu'on lui donnait ne convenaient pas à son apprentissage. Plus d'entreprise donc les frais de scolarité n'étaient plus payés par la boite donc il s'est passé une année à vide pour lui. ( Il s'est toutefois repris en main et il passe sa deuxième année de master en septembre )  
Autre histoire, depuis l'alternance je me suis fais ami avec un mec, on a toujours mangé ensemble, mis en groupe de projet ensemble, c'était vraiment mon meilleur pote. Et hier en réunion projet il nous a dit que s'il ne m'avait pas rencontré, ses trois dernières années d'études n'auraient pas été aussi cool. Et on a profité pour leur annoncer qu'on allait fêter nos deux ans de vie communes. Non ce n'est pas du tout vrai mais vous y avez cru ?  
Vous savez ce genre d'amis où vous avez absolument confiance ? Bah j'ai confiance en ce gars. Ce sont des petits gestes comme se payer le café chaque matin sans devoir le réclamer parce que c'était toi qui l'avait payé la veille, ou te payer un croissant sans rien demander en retour ou même lui rembourser sans qu'il ait à te le rappeler, des gestes qui fait que t'as rien à craindre du mec.  
Bref ces trois années avec lui étaient vraiment géniales, j'ai trop rigolé. Ça me rappelle mes années collège, où j'allais à l'école non pas parce que j'étais obligé mais parce que j'y allais pour rigoler avec mes amis.  
Je me suis dis que tout aurait pu être différent, j'aurais pu trouver une boite pour cette rentrée de septembre et avoir une scolarité absolument horrible.  
Avec le recul, dans la vie il faut avoir quand même de la chance, je me dis que tu peux être le plus travailleur, le plus compétent, si tu ne rencontres pas les bonnes personnes certaines routes que tu convoites resteront bloquées. Tu peux être le plus con des cons si t'as de la chance tu t'en sortiras toujours. Je me retrouve complètement dans le fameux monologue d'Otis.  
J'imagine que si ces trois années se sont passées extrêmement vite c'est que j'ai du vraiment les apprécier, vu que lorsqu'on pratique une activité qu'on aime le temps passe toujours plus vite c'est un peu similaire je pense.  
Et puis aussi parce qu'on vous m'avez accompagné durant ses trois ans, l'expérience Reddit fut vraiment superbe. J'espère que cela va durer longtemps encore.  
Dernier truc j'ai enfin reçu la prime d'activité, 511€ pour avril mai juin, ça va me permettre de payer ma future Nintendo Switch.  
Pour ceux qui sont comme moi en alternance ( contrat pro ou apprentissage ) il faut choisir activité salariée et non pas étudiant/apprenti dans le simulateur de la CAF sinon on se voit refuser la prime.

**Part 1**

&gt;If Roger Federer is seen by many as a secular saint, then his recent resurgence feels like a miracle. He is a 35-year-old male, playing the world’s most universal individual sport, and redefining it. The whole phenomenon is so improbable that it is unlikely to be repeated.

&gt;But why is Federer such an outlier? Perhaps because he represents the Platonic ideal of a tennis player. In other words, if you set out to build the perfect winning machine, you would come up with a 6ft 2in optimist with a single-handed backhand and a taste for bold experimentation.

**Physical**

&gt;Let’s think about assembling that tennis superman. Your first temptation might be to stretch him to John Isner dimensions, close to 7ft tall. That way, he could hold his serve for fun.

&gt;But there is a downside here. Stilt-legged players tend to have mobility issues. And silky movement is the No. 1 asset for a professional player: the base from which everything else flows.

&gt;The “Big Four” men, who range between 6ft 1in to 6ft 3in tall, have been consistently the best movers on tour for a decade now. And Federer is the finest of all.

&gt;The footwork specialist David Bailey has **identified 15 different movement patterns in tennis.** The average journeyman pro has mastered around half of these, Bailey says, **whereas Federer owns the full set.** In all probability, he can walk on water too. 

&gt;Speaking to the New York Times in 2009, **Bailey attributed Federer's versatility to his varied sporting background, which included football, ski-ing and basketball as well as tennis.**

&gt;**“Some tennis players are one-leg dominant,” explained the NYT reporter Greg Bishop, “which makes certain shots and portions of the court uncomfortable [but] that’s not the case as often with European players, who … move well with either leg, often from scurrying around soccer fields.”**

&gt;Yes, Federer has natural athleticism and co-ordination. But this is not just innate genius. As his physical trainer Pierre Paganini has pointed out, ballet “looks beautiful, harmonious, graceful … easy, but do we think ballerinas don’t work?” The rumour goes that Federer has asked Paganini not to publish any of their secret drills in a training manual until his career is over.

&gt;**“Roger just moves so much more smoothly than anyone else,” says the former British No. 1 Jo Durie. “You never see him take a jerky or inelegant step. And that’s why he has such incredible longevity. He was 34 years old before he had his first operation.”**

Cont'd.

Take for example the lovely Berlin Brandenburg Airport:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Brandenburg_Airport

Scheduled to be opened in 2010. Still not opened today, it's unclear if it can open 2019. Originally projected to cost 2.83 billion €, the current cost-project is just under 7 billion - and counting.

Reasons? Government incompetence, nepotism (and an apathetic public that reelects idiots again and again).


Another one?
The Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbphilharmonie - a concert hall. Construction began in April 2007, the first concert was play at the end of November 2016. Originally projected to cost 241 million €, it finish with 789 million €. Acoustics is great though.

A positive example is the Allianz Arena, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena - which was constructed in time (FIFA World Cup 2006 in Germany) and in budget.
(Elbphilharmonie and Allianz Arena have the same architects, incidentally)

In that case, though, the owners of the stadium created an oversight-committee for the build, staffed with long-term experts that closely monitored progress and costs.


Another example is the NEAT https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRLA.

The huge cost-overruns were at least approved by public vote and the project finished relatively in time.

**Frequently Asked Questions** ([Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/faqs))

We see questions like yours a lot. Here are a few suggestions:

**Which server should I play on?**

Pick a medium to high level server that focuses on your preferred playstyle (PvP, PvE, RP). If you have friends that play, join them on their realm!


**What's changed since I last played?**
 
Unless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).

Here are some handy guides to [get caught up as a returning level 110 player](http://www.wowhead.com/tips-for-alts-in-legion), or [starting your adventure in Legion for the first time](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/starting-legion-questing).

**Choose my class/What class should I play/Which class is the most OP?**

Play what you love most. There is no ""best"" race / class / spec combination, they change all the time with balancing. Play what you want to play and don't worry about it.


**Can I farm enough gold in X days to pay for my sub?**

Maybe? It depends on how much time/dedication you have. Check /r/woweconomy for all things gold making, just don't ask 'How do I make gold?'.

**Should I play?**

We don't allow ""sell me on WoW"" posts, such as ""should I start playing?"" or ""should I come back?"" The answer you'll get here is almost certainly *yes*! 

**Okay, so how do I start?**

Try the Starter Edition ([US](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition) / [EU](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-starter-edition)) to get a free taster of WoW, then:

,fastolfe00,,Progressive,"The reason the ""global socioeconomic footprints"" of various races look the way they do is complex.  Whether one race is ""genetically inferior"" (WTF?) less likely to be the determining factor for socioeconomic success as other factors.  If you'd like evidence of this, look at the various countries that are majority white, like Argentina and Moldova.  Is it possible that Africa isn't prospering as much as Europe for simple reasons of climate, geography, availability of natural resources, and *luck*?  Just because someone was the first to do something (and therefore dominated the rest) doesn't mean they were predestined to be first.

You are trying to slyly start a discussion about the genetic component to intelligence, and so I will offer the usual responses here: nobody can really define intelligence, and no one can measure intelligence in a way that we're sure is free from *cultural* bias.  Whites can outperform blacks often simply because white test-writers unintentionally use words that black people are less likely to know.  A good examination of these effects is at http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/j/jencks-gap.html.

But let's assume that we have a good definition of intelligence, and we've found that blacks consistently perform 3% lower on these tests.  What should we do with that information?

All this fact means is that ~48% of blacks are smarter than the average white person instead of 50%.  It's not actually meaningful, and certainly isn't useful to say anything about a *single person* that you're interacting with, want to hire, etc.  But racists wouldn't see it that way.  To them, this would be a rational basis for their racism.  Blacks would be ""3% dumber"" than they are.  100% of black people would encounter a marked increase in racism and discriminatory behavior.

I am very scientifically-minded.  I have to acknowledge that because intelligence is a product of our biology, and therefore our genetics, that we have lineages among humans that could be more or less intelligent than other lineages.  But I see no advantage to humanity to pursue that kind of research right now.  It is in our nature to abuse any knowledge we obtain from it.

The hand-in-waistcoat (also referred to as hand-inside-vest, hand-in-jacket, hand-held-in, or hidden hand) was a gesture commonly found in portraiture during the 18th and 19th centuries. The pose appeared by the 1750s to indicate leadership in a calm and firm manner. The pose is most often associated with Napoleon I of France due to its use in several portraits made by his artist, Jacques-Louis David, amongst them the 1812 painting Napoleon in His Study. The pose, thought of as being stately, was copied by other portrait painters across Europe and America.

Niveau gameplay, c'est comme le TCG hormis :  
* 3 slots monstre, 3 slots magie/piège, 4000hp, decks de 20 cartes minimum, 3 cartes dont une Rare+ garantie par booster. Ça m'a choqué au début mais on s'y fait.  
* Absence des récentes aberrations ( XYZ / Pendulum, Synchro et ce genre de merdes )   
* Pas de cartes craquées must-have ( Mirror force, monster reborn, raigeki et autres conneries )  
* Meta très variée, chaque duelliste est représenté. On peut choisir son duelliste genre Yugi, Kaiba, une dizaine d'autres, bientôt Marik, chacun peut utiliser des skills au cours d'un duel, en accord avec son ""thème"" dans l'anime / manga ( genre du renfort de sorts / magiciens pour Yugi, les pièges pour Odion, les elfes pour Théa, les insectes pour Haga, les dinos pour Rex, la chance pour Bandit Ken, etc... )  
* Les boosters ne suivent pas ceux du TCG : ils sont tous personnalisés par Konami autour d'un thème.  
* **Konami, le développeur, suit vraiment de très près le développement du jeu : l'équilibrage est vraiment très bon**. C'est vraiment LE gros point qui m'a fait accrocher au jeu. Jamais je n'ai eu l'impression comme dans 95% des autres jeux PvP qu'il y avait une meta restreinte et figée : il y avait une 10aine d'archétypes de decks parmi les plus hauts rangs lors des championnats du monde, donc au minimum une 10aine de deck tous différents viable au S tier, sans compter les decks un peu moins bons aux autres tiers.

No it is not. If I spend my money I have a say. if government spends the money bureaucrats have a say and im a slave to their decision.

Government-Run Healthcare Does Kill People. See the example of the parents who wanted an American treatment( unavailable in Europe for their child(Charlie Grad). they raised 1.6 milon dolars for the flight an the treatment. And the government prohibits it. Pure evil. And the basis is socialized medicine. The government gets to say who dies even if you want to pay for it your self!!! disgusting. Give me capitalism!

&gt; If you want examples of unchecked capitalism in action, look back to the 1900 when workers rights were non existent.

In the context of that time workers rights were great. 
the people were coming form a time were they were framing the land and barely holding on. It was misery! True misery.
It was WAY worse than the start up of the industrial revolution. 

It was a bit then like its in china today. people massively chose working in a factory over working in the fields. 
They don't complain. The west does. In a couple of years its will be better. 

Workers rights come when the workers have expertise and there is a lot of wealth creation.  

The expertise gives us the wealth and workers right we have today. Lose the expertise and the company's leave or die. 


And they are not rights they are privileges we have the power to demand. 


A right should not force someone to be a slave:

You have a Right to healthcare in the sense that nobody can prohibit you from buying it. 

You don't have a right to demand treatment form a doctor.  If the doctor is forced to work, then he is a slave.

The conventions for translating or not translating names into English really have no rules beyond convenience and going with what goes.  As far as convenience is concerned, here's a few trends.

-- Nations with long polysynthetic meaningful names generally get their names translated.  The means that almost all Cree, Ojibwa, and Sioux names seem to get translated. Think Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake - Sitting Bull.

BUT! this doesn't seem to hold true since back in the earliest days of at least American history, many names from nations very closely related to these same nations **didn't** get translated. Powhatan, Pocahontas, etc. Possible (likely) differences include the fact that in the earlier times, Tribes like the Narraganset and such were considered valuable trading partners and also equally human, despite the serious differences, while during the later period of western expansion, there was a lot less respect and willingness to accommodate non-English names.

Jumping further to the Pacific Northwest, while many names *are* easily analyzable and translatable, there is a longstanding local tradition of generally *not* translating names as they are passed back and forth between language groups. Many people I know have names that are clearly from neighbouring or even more distant nations, and while they might change pronunciation, they aren't translated.  This is reflected in English usage where we refer to Chief Pootlass, Chief Maquinna, and so on.

The ""MEANINGFUL"" part is important as well - In Cree for example (and I think in Lakota/Dakota as well) all names are meaningful, meaning that they use the same morphemes as the rest of the language. So any name can be translated, and in fact it's fairly natural to translate when speaking, given that people don't draw strong distinctions between ""name language"" and ""normal language"".  In the language I'm working with now, Nuxalk, the Nuxalk root word dictionary includes several hundred names as separate entries, and it's very clear that many or most names are not immediately translatable, furthermore because of the suffixes available for creating names, multiple names exist with basically the same meaning, but pronounced different to distinguish people, so you can't simply translate all their names or you end up with a lot of confusion.

Another impact in this later period is the prevalence of residential type schools, and how common it was to give people ""Christian"" names, so often when people wanted to use an easy to say name, they'd go with ""John"" or ""Herb"" and so on.

This same trend played out on the prairies of Canada, where many First Nations had some European bloodlines in them, and if people needed to they could fall back on a European name to make things go smoother, and were often known by both. Many in my family had both Cree names and English names, but when one of them signed treaty six, he signed with his Cree name.

Another obvious factor is pronunciation.  Some languages have tones, pops, nasals, and sound just really difficult to an English ear.  So more likely to be changed.

Last factor I'll mention is the presence of trade languages or the medium of communication.  In the prairies, a LOT of First Nations had access to English or French speakers from hundreds of years of trading.  New people come, you can always explain your name.  Other areas used pidgins like Chinook Wawa or Mobilian Jargon, and nicknames were a common part of the playfulness that tended to result from using these languages. Names like Skookum John and such that sound mixed were often Pidgin nicknames.

So in conclusion, there are a lot of different reasons: linguistic reasons, political reasons, power reasons, or simply going to the preferences of whoever first wrote the name down or how the first meeting went.",True,False,0,1498921546,,False,0,djnc8vd,t3_6km3wi,t3_6km3wi,1499819764,1668,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,

Someone like Jeffrey Bruma to Chelsea. Bruma was considered the bigger talent at Feyenoord than De Vrij. Bruma is now a half-decent player at Wolfsburg. De Vrij started at the 2014 world cup, is one of the best defenders in Serie A, and is in demand of bigger clubs.

Ouasim Bouy was the bigger talent, and captain, in his generation throughout the Ajax academy. His midfield compatriot was Davy Klaassen. Bouy got lured away to Juventus by Raiola, and is now failing at PEC Zwolle. Klaassen just captained Ajax to a European final, is a regular Dutch international, and has just been brought into Everton as a big transfer.

More recently, Fosu-Mensah left Ajax for Manchester United. Considered to do well there, but only under Van Gaal got some play time. He was the captain of his Ajax youth side, and the National youth side. Was considered an incredible centreback talent. In his time not playing at United, De Ligt, two years younger and rated about the same, talent-wise, has last season become a starter for Ajax (including in the EL final against United), and been called up for the full National team by successive managers. 

You can point at someone like Nathan Aké, but he was the biggest talent in his age group in Holland when moved to Chelsea. Yet he's now on his way to Bounemouth, having played under 50 first division games in his career at the age of 22.

These are just a few examples of players who stayed even vaguely relevant. There's many many, Dutch alone, examples of players who moved to a big (mainly) English club, to disappear completely.

It's not Chelsea alone in this, but Chelsea's by far the most prominent offender because of their youth/loanee model and the vast number of young players they pull in.

Sánchez is happy in London, likes Arsenal, likes Wenger and has just seen us smash our transfer record for a player that all of Europe rates (Not done yet, but its as near as damnit) and Özil looks to be staying too, which was another hiccup for him too.

The living conditions, in third world countries, are better now than in any other point in human history. Median income, food security, literacy, life expectancy, availability of consumer goods and so forth are the best they've ever been.

Workers in third world countries work in shitty conditions because they have no skills. Unionization only works with skilled or semi-skilled labor. Most Chinese workers were subsistence farmers for generations and have no marketable skills in an industrialize economy. But that will change and is changing. We know this because every industrialized economy has gone through a sweatshop phase. 

What do you think is the alternative? Forcing the millions of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani and so forth people back into the fields where they earn 5 times less for far more labor? Don't be silly. Paddy farming is some of the most back breaking work in existence. There's a reason nearly a billion people have migrated from the fields and into the cities over the last decade. Because however shitty factory work is, its better than farming and it pays a lot more. It's the same reasons that drove Americans out of the fields a century and a half ago.

A skilled middle class is growing in China, India and the like. And just like in America they will demand more rights and more representation. But they need to get leveragable skills in the first place.

The negotiators for the legal side of things are the ones in charge. They have the authority to negotiate on behalf of the EU. There is no set of hundreds of competing interests; or even dozens. 

A divorce can be agreed [by a majority of EU governments](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/26/european-parliaments-could-get-vote-on-transitional-brexit-deal). Stuff like how much the UK owes, and EU citizen rights etc. Stage 1.

When the *trade negotiations* start, yes, there will be many interests. In fact, there will be tens of thousands of competing interests, from French farmers wanting tariffs and quotas on British lamb, to Polish farmers wanting something different. That's why trade negotiations take so long.

It's also one reason why the EU insisted on doing them separately. 

Why does the author think that May having to keep her side happy and thus have many debates and take a lot longer will aid things? It will just mean that everything takes longer.

That puts the UK at a disadvantage, because of the Article 50 deadline, and means that if the UK want to start talking about a trade deal, it's up to them to unify and get things done. A hard-crash Brexit won't damage the EU nearly as much. And it looms closer every day. In fact, if the EU were minded to just stall until near the end, then the UK would be forced to accept pretty much any terms which were offered. At all.

Those Polish and French farmers (or car workers or banks) won't suddenly feel the urge to compromise because Theresa May has domestic issues.

pretty representative when it comes to their views on gay marriage; From the wiki:
&gt; As of April 2009, there is a debate about introducing same-sex registered partnerships in Bulgaria. The government has suggested that the National Assembly of Bulgaria (Parliament) should vote in favor of the new Family Code. The new bill was supposed to introduce the registered partnerships.However, these unions were not to benefit same-sex couples. However, on July 16, 2008, the commission for protection against discrimination in Bulgaria suggested that the right to registered unions should be extended to same-sex couples as well. Overall, on June 12, 2009, after two years of debating, the new Family code was passed without the section about registered partnership for both same - and opposite-sex couples.
The Constitution of Bulgaria defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, effectively prohibiting legalization of same-sex marriage.

To amend existing agreements, the EU brings it's demands to the relevant Joint EU-Swiss Committee, which decides what and how the implementation should look like, on a technical level. It's not very democratic since the process is quite obscure, but it has the merit of guaranteeing that the EU's demands don't circumvent the negotiation table and are handled case-by-case. The EU doesn't like it because there is no supervision mechanism of how Switzerland puts it's part of the deal into practise, and no way to arbiter disputes outside of the joint committees (who might not be able to come to a conclusion). For example, the EU claims that the 8-day rule Switzerland has for foreigners working in the country without a permit is a violation of the Freedom of Movement, while Switzerland disagrees. The only sector in which the ECJ can be an arbiter is under the bilateral agreement on air traffic. 

&gt; has to adopt all kind of rules decided in the European Union

Only those that have been agreed that Switzerland would adopt (which covers less than the EEA, and certainly less than EU membership). For instance the EU edicted a whole bunch of rules for VAT taxes, including a minimum rate of 10%. Ours is 8%, with a reduced rate of 2.5% for certain industries.

The UK railways have been sold off to rest of the Europe (a common thing when you look at other industries such energy). Britain's privatised rail companies receive huge government subsidies yearly so now we are left with paying to run a service and getting no profit from them. if the UK wished to bring our railways under state owned it is highly likely that the EU would have made attempt to block it as it would no longer have a competitive market.

You can always find the release date of Bessatsu Shonen on the last page of the previous magazine and their official website. Sometimes user here seem to think this is like a guessing game and it could be either this day or another...

So, then, the usual release day is the 9th of a month. Then we usually get leaks on the 6th (like last month; exceptions are New Year and Golden Week). At this point I should also note, for the official release, I always refer to Bessatsu Shonen in Japan. For the assumed leak day, I always go by Central European time zone. To continue, if the 9th is a Sunday (like this month), Bessatsu Shonen is released on the 8th (Saturday). The we usually get leaks on the 5th. The preview of last months issue also stated July 8. However, about a week later, Kodansha suddenly pushed the release date forward another day (I tried to figure out if this ever happened before, but it is not easy, at least without Japanese) to July 7 (as the website currently states it as well as their twitter and amazon). Therefore, we could assume to get leaks on the 4th. Moreover, last month, the magazine was released on a Friday and we got leaks on a Tuesday. This month, it is Friday again.

Of course, July 4 is not really weighed. If leaks come early, it could be July 3 for Americans. If they come late, it could be July 5 for East Asia. Also, the issues might be delivered to book stores on Monday. If someone is best friend with the owner, the person might gets the copy even earlier.

,bamename,,,"Honestly, his speech on Poland, given that I know painfully well the actual specifics of the discourse and Politics, shows to me just how naive and vain this man in whom I initially invested a lot of respect.

Some of the things he said in general, disgust me in a moral sense, and in terms of accurately presenting the truth without relying on his feelings. I'll post my youtube comment from his video on Poland:

'Kaczyński was a symbol of the emering Polish nation'- a guy who slept in his mother's bed during martial law, and whose family was never in particular peril by the authorities, but whose propagandists would have him the main agents of Solidarity. That is why I cannot bring myself to fully respect people like Roger Scruton, who are so blinded by their preconceptions. He seems to be blind to the hypocrisy, lies, corruption, cronyism, incompetence, vitriol and stupidity surrounding his government, Party, and contribution to the plane crash which caused his death and that of many others, and which has later been insidiously used as a conspiracy theory at the root for the fervent ideological support for his political dynasty. Also, the 'conscious of its identity' part is misleading given how PiS is attempting to fiercely co-opt that identity to fuel that ideology. The 'romantical' part is what caused so many pointless suffering and death throughout the 19th century and later. It was also obvious that in reaction to Communism, the oppositionists would cling to the most fervent Hayekian free marketeering and Catholicism. PiS replaced a center-right party, even if it was pro-European. Honestly I can feel little but disgust at Scruton's dismissal of the dictatorial actions of the ruling party, which are generally remniscent of those present during Communism. Electioneering, control of the media and of state apparatuses does not make a Party 'representative of the People'. The ideology used by the state to force people into a single position, to create shoddy propaganda pieces such as 'Smoleńsk', and the Wilhelm II-esque histrionics in foreign policy. Roger Scruton is so up his own loyalty, not realizing the demagoguery and conspiratorial ideal, that he genuinely believes in the good will of PiS, who openly disrespected the Constitution and its functions, and who referred openly to protesters as 'the worst sort of Poles' while themselves harbouring a caustic and mob-based, guilt-based group of followers. The people in the country who protest, and were not won over by monetary incentives and shaming of anyone who disagreed with PiS over and over again in the most vulgar and base rhetorics, and who act reasonably and for the PRESERVATION of the values in the wake of collapse of Communism, are not the attackers here. You have no obligation before your country to 'stay', if its not good enough, refuses to do away with the synecures and cronyism, and which, of no fault of the insitutions even, is incapable of providing work for the vastly overeducated populace, then you have no reason not to leave to realize your fullest potential. Poland was never 'traditionally Catholic', it was for centuries tolerant and syncretic in the wake of the Warsaw Confederation.

Also,  look at it this way. 

Only half of people (roughly) actually vote. 

Of those,  roughly half vote Republican. Anyone voting Republican is voting against charging the USA to be more like Europe.  E.g. government funding for healthcare,  increased funding for schools,  gun laws,  abortion,  gay marriage.

The other half vote Democrat.  Most Democrats are tentatively pushing,  but not in a rush to bring in things like a universal healthcare system, maternity leave,  reduce gun ownership.

I don't think democracy had these same self destructive problems, that's why it succeeded. 

&gt;I think all you have to acknowledge is that wealth makes it easier to make more wealth, and as time goes on, without intervention, inequality rises and competition falls.

Yeah, well that's what inspired the whole Marxist theory, isn't it. In the late 1800s the average person in Europe lived on less that a dollar a day in today's money. While a select few were living in places [like this](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/723E/production/_86564292_lac140262_01_gal.jpg) and getting richer.

In one of my favourite books, Moby Dick (which is a little earlier, 1850s), Ishmael talks about how he will work on a whaling boat for TWO YEARS, and he expects that his salary will be 'about enough to pay for the clothes I will wear-out during the voyage', as if that's a completely reasonable wage for a working man. 

People were so poor. They worked just to buy food and shelter, and that was it. 

It's easy to see why many people thought that the future was an apocalypse. How could under this new industrial capitalist society, people get poorer than they already were, while a tiny proportion got richer, without it leading to the end of the world. Would it be a few dozen people riding in golden carriages through fields of emaciated skeletal peasants begging for scraps? This was the world Marx was writing in.

And people were saying what you just said to me - ""all you have to acknowledge is that wealth makes it easier to make more wealth, and as time goes on, without intervention, inequality rises and competition falls""

But that DIDN'T HAPPEN. The average person in Europe now lives like a king compared to how we used to. We have money to spend on luxuries and entertainment and investments, we are way better off than we were a hundred years ago, all things adjusted. Nothing is PERFECT of course, and the super rich are still insanely rich and the average man's odds of attaining wealth like that are practically zero, BUT that which you say must inevitably happen DIDN'T HAPPEN. In fact, in the capitalist countries now, the poor seem to have it better off than in the countries that tried communism. Almost ALL migration and movement of poor people is toward capitalist countries.

So, no, I DON'T acknowledge it. It may really really seem like things will only polarise and fall apart, but they don't. We have been watching it NOT happen for a century and a half now, with each generation being a little better off than the last, generally speaking. So, no, I just don't acknowledge that it's necessarily doom and gloom.

&gt;the pro-rape people are

I *almost* put that in myself, but I figured you would just give me the benefit of the doubt. But obviously not.

Yes, of COURSE its worse for pro-rape people. That's good. That's the desired outcome. So everything is working fine in that example.

&gt;which is why you have a codified system for democratically voting measures into law instead of random mob violence

Measures like ""take things away from my oppressors"" and ""jail my oppressors"". Every major example of Conflict Theory put into action results in large numbers of people being locked up or killed. The fact that it was made into law first doesn't make it any better than mob violence. It's still the populace turning on a small proportion of people and feeling their violence is justified. 

In Russia and Ukraine Stalin convinced peasants to turn on the richer peasants. They called them Kulaks, which means something light 'tight fisted'. This was any peasant who had managed to scrape together enough money to be able to afford a few cows and a few acres of land. They wrote about them incredibly negatively, dehumanised them, called them leeches and vampires, said they were class-enemies, eventually made laws against them, sent them to prisons, camps, and ultimately killed over a million people this way. The fact it was under a codified system of law didn't affect anything. That's really such a weak argument, you must know that.

You can't just blow that off and say ""well it would never happen, we would make laws preventing it."" It DID happen. It happens every time. How do you explain those million deaths? I mean, how do you explain how those million came to be killed? What happened to lead people to kill their neighbours? Just a crazy unexplainable social phenomena? What's the explanation, which is so different from mine?

For the first scenario, western countries do not have the cohesion to act as one. EU just stopped Macron's plans to shut out China and the AIIB fiasco for the US shows how loyal their European allies are. 

The ""Gordon Chang"" clique is just one part of the China ""experts"", there are some who think it will fall every second year and there are some who think China is the greatest thing since sliced bread. The important part is that China is growing fast. 

Creating a color revolution isn't a special ability granted to the west. Color revolutions arise when confidence in govt is low and the people is unsatisfied. None of this is true for China, in fact the people are quite nationalist. 

In fact it is the west with it's divisive ""white nationalists"", ""zionists"" and ""black power"" groups who is susceptible to Chinese or Russian manipulation (which might have happened already).

For the second scenario Asia maintains advanced medicine and it's hard to just smuggle in biological weapons and being found out = death sentence for the instigating nation. They'd be shunned by other nations and may be counterattacked by the victim nation. 

There is no proof any western country has an advanced biological weapons program which can threaten eastern nations. Even if they possessed it, the nature of such a weapon (indiscriminate killing) means that it invites nuclear counter strike if enough civilians die. 

With how deep China is in the US intelligence, they would probably be aware of any attempt to create biological weapons and raise hell about it to turn the US into a pariah nation which is what they want.

Nu știu dacă e urmarea directă, dar 1/3 din companiiile care generază curent sunt în insolvență (excepție nuclearelectrica și hidroelectrica din cei mari, și câțiva privati mici cu energie verde), și nu văd de ce firmele private care se ocupă de tranzacții la bursă pe energetică vor ajuta companiile care se ocupă de generare să devină mai performante.

That can also apply to the EU. Each individual nation is going to find it's resources strained by having to deal with all these sandshines fucking up the place.

- No-go zones increasing in number all over Europe.
- Murder / Rape skyrocketing all over.

- Potential civil-unrest brewing, already starting according to rumours.

Add those up and you've just shot a massive hole in the European economy. Even without millions of migrants, even without *BREXIT*, the EU economy was never exactly what you'd call robust.

Our boy Trump backing out to the Paris Accords was another massive hole shot in their wallets. Billions of dollars they arrogantly expected to be given freely by the US, for nothing in return. That isn't just a slap in the face, it's a sledge-hammer to the balls.

What happens when Europe starts to collapse? Suddenly those politicians are making less money, even the Rothschilds can only support a Globalist endeavour for so long, their bank accounts aren't infinite.

Jim Crow laws were state and local laws enforcing racial segregation in the Southern United States. Enacted after the Reconstruction period, these laws continued in force until 1965. They mandated de jure racial segregation in all public facilities in the states of the former Confederate States of America, starting in 1890 with a ""separate but equal"" status for African Americans. Facilities for African Americans were consistently inferior and underfunded compared to those available to European Americans; sometimes they did not exist at all. ...

Macron on the burkini:

&gt; “The burkini is not cultic. It is cultural, ideological, and political,” said Macron, who remains balanced on the issue. While **he believes that the burkini ban was justified in certain areas**, “so as to maintain public order”, and that the garment “is against civil beliefs of gender equality”, he was vehemently against the incident which saw French policeman order a woman to remove her burkini on a beach in Nice, following the terrorist attack. “To defend secularism in such a backwards manner runs the risk of alienating whole communities,” said Macron. **""It is vital to defend people’s individual freedom to wear what they like""**.

The bolded parts are *directly* in conflict with each other. You *cannot* ban women from wearing certain types of clothing *and* believe it is vital for women to wear whatever clothing they want. They are literal opposites.

Macron on bureacracy:

&gt; For Macron, the main obstacles in French society are the corporations, intermediary bodies and the political system, whose roles and functions all need to be re-investigated. “Having said that, **I am not the enemy of intermediary bodies.** They are necessary in structuring society”, he said. “Criticising them is what got me accused of populism like Marine Le Pen. **But if speaking to the people or saying that the intermediary bodies are no longer doing their jobs, if that makes me a populist, then so be it – I’ll be a populist!”**

So is he their enemy or not? Again, it's a direct contradiction: he says he is not the enemy of the intermediary bodies, and then immediately criticizes them.

Macron on the EU:

&gt; While Macron has said he is **neither Eurosceptic nor pro-Europe**...

,Crymcrim,,Izmea-17th-18th century Weird Fantasy,"There are some overall, hard rules in regard to the setting that I have set for myself near the very begining of the project plus a number of softer guidelands in regard to specific parts of the setting. 

**Some of the hard rules are:**

* 1.All death are final, if someone dies there exists no mcguffin that would help ressurect them regardless of the form it might take.

* 2.Somewhat related to the above, there are no undead, no ghosts, no zombies, no living skeletons.

* 3.There are no concreet proofs that any of the religion is right, and if there exists one, every other religion also has to get a proof way they might be correct.

* 4.Most RL mythological creatures  are also Izmean mythological creatures, if I want to straight up use one, like Unicorn, Manticore etc. I have to do something REALLY out there about them.



* 5.Skin color is separated from the in-universe ethnicity, you can have three ethnic Dealeonians where one is black,  one is pale as a paper, while the third has Polynesian features, essentially their body appearance is a  subject to an  individual design decisions.


* 6.The cultures of the Neighborefolk should not be based on any RL life culture no matter how innocuous  the combination seems. If I take some inspiration from RL culture it will become  associated with one of  Izmea human cultures.



**On the other hand guidelines are mostly decision that I try to uphold but not fret too much about if I have to bend them  bit:**


* Westerii is themed after Fairy Tales, Kraahland is themed after gothic  horror, Ciria is themed after Noir fiction etc.


* Each nation should have at least one element that is inspired by a non-european culture.


* The character nationality determines the theme of their last name (Cirians are named after food, Westerii after flowers, Dealeonians after clothing, and so on).


* Kraahland monsters should not be based directly on classical gothic horror creatures like vampires and werewolves.


* All characters are assumed to be bisexual unless specified otherwise.

&gt; Germany has allowed same-sex couples to enter civil partnerships since 2001, but has not granted them full marital rights, which include the possibility of jointly adopting children, even though gay marriage enjoyed some 80 per cent support, according to recent polls.

&gt; &amp;quot;Germany has become the 23rd country to recognize same-sex marriage and has sent a clear message to the world that gay and lesbian people should be entitled to the same rights as everyone else, and to full and equal protection of the law,&amp;quot; Amnesty&amp;#039;s Europe director John Dalhuisen said.

&gt; Germany&amp;#039;s constitution is vague, saying only that &amp;quot;Marriage and the family shall enjoy the protection of the state,&amp;quot; but Merkel said that for her, &amp;quot;Marriage as defined by the law is the marriage of a man and a woman.&amp;quot; Still, she urged all views to be respected.

,Gongille,,,"Before heading to Strasbourg in the north of France for a business trip, I decided to spend a weekend in Paris. Whilst strolling along rue Tiquetonne, a street renowned for it's small boutiques, I stumbled across a watch store by the name of Chez Maman. 

They carried a variety of entry to mid range European brands such as Junghans, Junkers and Lip to name a few. The shop assistant, Violet, was very friendly and was more than happy to assist me in trying on a few Lip [pieces](http://imgur.com/Z7FApDN) that had caught my eye. 

I had read about the Mach 2000 on [Worn &amp; Wound](http://wornandwound.com/art-time-roger-tallon-lip-mach-2000-chronograph/) as well as [aBlogtoWatch](http://www.ablogtowatch.com/lip-mach-2000-dark-master-chronograph-x-watch-review-seventies-design-era-revival-fit-to-be-worn/), but I had yet to see it [in person](http://imgur.com/J1dpRxz), reissue or original. 

I was intrigued by the design and history behind the watch, but being a quartz reissue, it didn't ""talk to me"" enough to justify the 449 Euro price tag, so on I went with my day of touristy mumbo jumbo.

A few hours later, while passing by a quaint little neighbourhood adjacent to Luxembourg Garden, I did a double take when I noticed in the corner of my eye: a watch that looked like a Rolex, fully [submerged in a fish tank!](http://imgur.com/RNoDzGm)

Curiosity got the better of me; I was greeted as I entered by a polite young man who looked to be in his early twenties. I continued to look around, and just as I was having a gander at the Rolex cabinet, a sharply dressed, middle aged man asked me if I was looking for anything in particular. After he introduced himself as Antoine, the owner of the shop, we began talking, in particular about the [recent discovery](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-paul-newmans-legendary-rolex-cosmograph-daytona-was-foundand-where-its-going-now-1496322396) of *the* Paul Newman Daytona, which somehow led to me telling him about how I had seen the Lip Mach 2000 reissue for the first time just a few hours prior. Suddenly, I hear in a thick French accent, ""Please, one moment."" as Antoine disappeared behind a door, hidden by a row of watchmakers.

Not 2 minutes had passed, when he re-emerged with none other than an original 1975 [Lip Mach 2000 Chrono Ref. 43756](http://imgur.com/cLT1OQP) powered by a manual wound Valjoux 7734. As it turns out, he had purchased the piece from a customer a while ago, but hadn't had the time or shop space to put it on display.

As I tried it on, he commented on my Omega Speedmaster. We soon discovered we had a shared love for the original moon watch, and before you could say ""dot over ninety"", I was [trying on](http://imgur.com/oIKLDmG) his personal ""Base 1000"" Ed White!

One hour ago I was sitting in a little French corner cafe, pondering about my afternoon plans. Now, I had a watch on my wrist that I never imagined I'd handle. To put things into perspective, the bezel on that watch alone sold for [north of $16,000](http://speedmaster101.com/blog/base1000-bezel-sold-for-16200/), and that's in the rare event that one presents itself for sale. As a whole package, it would be rather difficult to price due to the rarity. There is no doubt that this piece would be the creme de la creme of even the most serious watch connoisseur's collection. I must have died and gone to the moon.

The next hour or so flew by, with Antoine reminiscing about his first *nice* watch, an Omega Speedmaster which he found in a sorry state, and repaired himself while he was an apprentice watchmaker. He then showed me [a few more](http://imgur.com/mn4m4tA) interesting pieces from his safe: [two more](http://imgur.com/7baz3X1) pre-moon Speedmasters, a 1950's [Blancpain Fifty Fathoms](http://imgur.com/PSDDSOy) and a [Ressence Type 3](http://imgur.com/Dujra9R). 

After our little geek out session, I tried the Mach 2000 on again, and felt a smile creep across my face. This outspoken little watch was full of personality, and embodied the playful spirit of Paris. After discussing the asking price Antoine was looking for, I decided to sleep on it.

To me, the most special watches are those which have a story behind them. The afternoon spent discussing my hobby with a man who was just as, if not by far more passionate that I about watches, and trying on multiple grails of mine was without a doubt one of the highlights of my time spent in Paris. Taking home an iconic piece of French watchmaking would bring my trip to a romantic, memorable end. 

Needless to say, I returned the next day with an offer, which Antoine accepted. We said our goodbyes, and wished each other all the best in our horological endeavours.

The fact that it was unnecessarily heavy handed, was entirely unilateral and forced on Germany by people who arguably didn't have the authority to do so, and was effectively designed to kick Germany while she was down played a key role in the rise of European fascism and populism, especially in Germany.  

The Treaty was so harsh and hit Germany so badly that the populists seized on it and used it as propaganda.  People were suffering so terribly that they felt they had nothing to lose and were taken in by the likes of the NSDAP... and you don't need a degree in History to have a rough idea of what happened next.  Germany had been crushed with no hope of recovery.

The NSDAP and everyone's favourite Austrian orator were now in power and had their mandate to do whatever they liked.  Their Lebensraum policy eventually led to the annexation of Poland, which in turn brought Britain into World War II on September 3rd 1939.

Then everything ""kicked off"" and the rest, as they say, is history.

&gt; Ever going to shut up about xenophobia and your various 

Let me just define xenophobic:
""having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries.""

If the immigrant is employed, pays taxes, and abides by the law including immigration via the Freedom of Movement bill in the EU than what reason do you have you want to 'deport' them or 'control' borders against them? The amount of people immigrating is also limited by how many jobs we have. If we had full employment no one would immigrate at all but we don't so hence we get a lot of immigrants and immigrating to get benefits isn't as piss easy and people make it out to be. Here's a BBC article:

""Can EU migrants easily claim benefits when they arrive in another EU country?
No - there are conditions, depending on an individual's circumstances.
They can stay for three months, but to stay longer after that they have to be: in work; or actively seeking work with a genuine chance of being hired; or be able to show they have enough money not to be a burden on public services. Apart from that, evidence of benefit abuse or fraud is grounds to exclude or expel a person.""

""If an EU migrant has permission to stay, can he or she then claim benefits?
Not automatically - a migrant still has to pass a ""habitual residence test"" under EU law.
The test covers factors such as the duration of the migrant's stay; their activity, including their source of income if they are students; their family status; and their housing situation. The migrant has to demonstrate a sufficient degree of attachment to the host country. The amount of time already spent in the country is not sufficient qualification in itself.
If a jobseeker satisfies the test in the UK then that person can claim Jobseekers Allowance - up to £72.40 ($116) weekly for a single person, £113.70 for a couple.
An EU migrant who is in work in the UK, or self-employed, and who passes the test, can claim housing benefit and council tax benefit. The amounts vary, depending on the local authority.
The UK applies an additional ""right to reside"" test, going beyond the standard EU test. The European Commission says the UK test is unfair and has taken the UK to the European Court of Justice over it. The Commission argues that EU migrant workers, who have paid UK taxes, should not be subject to the extra test in order to claim certain benefits.""

Poland said ""YES"" in vote to relocate 120,000 asylum seekers, and did it against the rest of V4 members, which can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis) (***Relocation and resettlement of asylum seekers***), and you can call it a treaty or an agreement, decision ~~decicion~~ has been made.

In the Euroleague he played 22 mpg, and put up 9.0 pts, 6.7 rebs, and 0.8 blks, on .649 FG%. He averaged above 60% FG% in every competition he played in last year, and his cumulative FT% was over 70%. He turns 21 in January, and it's pretty atypical, as I understand it, for young guys to get that many minutes in the Euroleague.

He finished second in the Euroleague Rising Star Award voting to Luka Doncic, though Luka was the unanimous winner and the gap between the two was a very large one.

My impression is that he's a guy with a modest ceiling but a high floor. It would be pretty surprising if within a year or two he isn't a quality traditional big who, despite his lack of outside shooting, you're perfectly happy to have soaking up significant minutes in a rotation. But not a guy you have high hopes will become one of the league's best big men or anything.

The fund's domicile doesn't have anything to do with the stocks it contains. A US-based S&amp;P 500 Vanguard ETF will buy exactly the same stocks as e.g. the [HSBC S&amp;P 500](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?query=IE00B5KQNG97&amp;groupField=index&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00B5KQNG97) which is domiciled in Ireland.

The main difference is that with the Irish ETF you might have some tax advantages because of Ireland's [many double-taxation treaties](http://files.irishfunds.ie/1481206562-IF_ETFs_Brochure_WEB.pdf). For example the Irish fund might only pay 15% tax on US dividends while you as a private investor owning US funds will pay 30%. For European investors Irish funds are usually a good choice and you can still have stocks from all over the world. I personally own ETFs with stocks from all world regions, all in European ETFs.

As /u/FailedSeldonPlan points out [Vanguard does have some](https://www.justetf.com/uk/find-etf.html?assetClass=class-equity&amp;groupField=none&amp;sortField=fundSize&amp;ic=Vanguard&amp;sortOrder=desc) UCITS (which is a EU regulation for investor protection) ETFs domiciled in Ireland ([example: S&amp;P 500](https://www.justetf.com/uk/etf-profile.html?ic=Vanguard&amp;sortField=fundSize&amp;groupField=none&amp;sortOrder=desc&amp;assetClass=class-equity&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00B3XXRP09)), so if you want to buy Vanguard look into these.

They don't just hate the Conservative Party, they hate *people* who voted Conservative too, and you can see this in the way there is so much poisonous hatred directed online and in media outlets like the self-proclaimed Guardian at any seemingly-responsible group when things go 'wrong'.

Depending on the situation, the left will hate on old people, white people, the working class, northerners, unionists in Northern Ireland and so on, changing target in an almost schizophrenic manner whenever necessary, like how immediate hate was directed at a large minority of Scots for voting Conservative in the election, even though over the last 4 years Scots had previously been imagined as a sort of oppressed group because it suited the leftist agenda.

No one wins every time. We are seeing however the rise of an incredibly entitled generation, wholly incapable of reflection and considering context. There are people today so desperate to feel as though they're rebels or freedom fighters of importance in the same vein as old American civil rights protesters, deluded to such an extent that barely a month now goes by without often violent protests against *democratic* elections and referenda. 

This is an awful development, spurred on by the media and politicians like Jeremy Corbyn who encourage youngsters to feel like eternal victims.

,Richard_MF_Nixon,loners,Loner,"So STALKER isn't a Triple A release. It's got some weird spots as it was made in Eastern Europe with a small budget 10 years ago. Adjust your expectations. Mods like the *Zone Reclamation* Project can help with that. I did my first run Vanilla without any real issues, but you might have them.

STALKER is also not an RPG in the Fallout sense, in fact Fallout is a pretty bad comparison point IMO. The characters aren't the focus here, and they're fairly basic. There isn't an incredibly developed story, in fact the only time it gets super interesting is in the secret ending. Deep characters and an epic world saving quest aren't the point of the game. You're a scrappy trespasser trying to find out why you need to kill a guy in an incredibly hostile environment. The Zone itself is the star of the show here.

When people on here tell stories about Stalker, they don't talk about how they used their Charisma stat to turn an enemy into an ally. They talk about that time they were held up under a bridge, surrounded by Mercenaries with nothing but a couple grenades and an AK that jammed every third shot and somehow managed to survive it.

That said, treat it more like a survival game. You're trying to get from A to B with whatever supplies you have without getting murdered or over-expending your resources. Again, this is not an RPG. Treat it like that and you'll have a bad time. 

Also ignore all the difficulties but Master, the highest one. I'm not saying that because I think you need to ""git gud"" but because it's the intended mode. It makes both enemies and you go down in a few shots, and greatly improves the combat. It is still difficult however, and the game has been given the title of ""The Dark Souls of FPS"" by a good number of people.

Anyway, to sum it up

* This isn't Fallout or a Classic RPG. It's a single player Survival and Exploration game about being alone in a Ukrainian hellscape with a story tying it together. 

* The Zone and the world it creates is the focus

* Stalker can be buggy, use the ZRP mod to help with this. Also, save often. F5(6?) is your friend.

* Play it on Master difficulty

* The first few guns are pretty trash. The Viper 5 SMG is the first decent gun you get, but the double barrel is great for unarmored bandits and mutants at very close range.",True,False,0,1498935635,,False,0,djnmff2,t3_6knd41,t3_6knd41,1499824763,12,False,stalker,t5_2r74m,

Toward the very end of that period you would see certain situations where there were times when some classes of european warriors were so heavily armored that swords weren't quite as effective as the were for the 1000 years before that.

That doesn't mean they were worthless.

For a brief period toward the end of the 100 years war you had heavy articulated plate armor show up regularly enough that if you were a similarly equipped warrior facing someone like this in a melee it was more useful to have a big ass axe or specially built hammer or mace or something than to use a regular sword. But it's not like a sword was worthless.

And this was a pretty short period between 1) ability to make this kind of armor at what passes for medieval values of scale 2) gunpowder being good enough and widespread enough to make that armor worthless.

You don't see any heavy full suits of plate before late 1200s IIRC. Wasnt widespread before mid-1300s at the earliest.

,Jozef_Bem,,,"&gt;It would be very naive and short sighted to agree to any sort of quotas while the borders remain open and un-documented continue spilling in and roaming about. 


I think that numerical quotas are stupid, because the numbers aren't ever going to be static. However percentage quotas, like the formula that Germany uses to distribute people in between their different states, would work just fine. 

In that situation, France may get 15% of all people entering, Spain may get 6%, Poland may get 3% according to the population of the country relative to the EU, and the strength of their economy.


&gt;Furthermore 2 years into the crisis the EU is still arguing with nations of origin to take back their rejected applicants. 


I don't see what that means, bureaucracy is a tedious thing but it's not an excuse to forsake human lives.



**Can we stop for a moment and remember that we are talking about human beings? Mothers and fathers and sons and daughters and brothers and sisters. I think we need to remember that, when you talk about these people, think of your family and friends, they're that too.**

&gt;Meanwhile much of ""leadership"" in Brussels is too busy debating climate change. Ponder that for a minute.


Ponder what? As if climate change isn't important? Are you serious right now? If you don't like the idea of mass migration northwards and westwards from West Asia and the African continent, you should hate the fact that these people's native lands are losing their ability to sustain agriculture due the pollution belched into the air by Europe, the United States and Russia for the last century or two.

&gt;At what point - 2018? 2020? When these fundamental problems still exist will you admit this is an orchestrated social engineering experiment?

People are never going to not move, that's life.


As for social engineering, do you really think that there is some sort of conspiracy to ruin countries so that Poles will have to ""suffer"" with a neighbor called Mohammed? Are you nuts?


&gt;Muslims are merely the pawn used today to fracture our societies. 



Okay, you're crazy. These are human beings fleeing war, they're humans. I get so tired of arguing with fools who think that they're experts on Islam because they've read some propaganda.


&gt;Why would I live in a multicultural Europe/Poland when I can do that in the USA and earn far more money? 


I don't understand the point that you're making? As if Europe is some sort of ethnically, culturally, religiously homogenous place.


&gt;A United States of Europe, with its tiny physical size in comparison sounds horrid. America starts the Wars, sales the weapons but Europe is the one to import the aftermath? 


You're really going off on several tangents here, which makes me think that you're an illogical person. This is about refugees, not a Federal Europe. If you think that I'm not a critic of American foreign policy then you're wrong, if you think that Europe isn't complicit in American foreign policy then you're wrong and in denial. 

Import the aftermath? These are human beings, again — human beings, they're fleeing to safety, and they're coming. Nothing is going to stop it at days end, when people are fleeing death, they don't care whether you're a handwringing racist or not, they don't care about a paltry piece of legislation that Viktor Orbán makes to keep refugees out. Unless you want to start murdering people at the frontier, which with your rhetoric I wouldn't he surprised.


If the imperialism stopped there would be a lot less people fleeing their homes, but I'm confused at why you're so afraid of these people? None of it is fact based, it's propaganda about Islam that is intended to scare the ignorant, it's cultural prescriptivism and it's plain old fashioned racism.


&gt;When did Europeans become so gullible and downright impotent


I don't know when they became gullible, probably when they started believing nonsense propaganda. As for impotence, Freud would have a fun time with this — you see treating non-white people like humans emasculating, as a threat to your manhood, therefore depriving you of your virility and potency, is that right?

,CrossMountain,,,"Well, I have to admit that I’m kinda obsessed with the idea to finish a World Conquest run in 1939. After this run I came to the conclusion that it’s not actually possible though, at least with my skillset. What hinders me the most is Justification time. I could take plenty more countries in the same amount of time, but justifying on them takes just so goddamn long.
 
The current run you see in the screenshot is kinda over, since I made a few mistakes that made the run longer then necessary. For example, I didn’t attack China before Japan was conquered and therefore allowing them to break up the Alliance with Communist China (meaning two Justifications instead of just one). I also didn’t take Dutch East Indies while I was at war with the Netherlands and I once had to cancel a justification in favor of another one. That’s about 50 to 100 days that I could’ve saved up until this point, so I’ll do it all over again (and with pleasure, I love this).
 
A quick summary of the current run:
 
Classic cheese with UK and France first (justified on both before I even started with any Foci). After that, I took Poland and attacked The Onion as soon as The Great Purge Focus was finished. While I was at war with Russia, I took Italy (and Yugoslavia), because why not. After The Onion was peeled, I took the US and started the very long war with Brazil. During the war with the US and Brazil, I went for some minor countries, like Australia, Canada, Mexico, Czechoslovakia, Philippines, British Raj, New Zealand and prepared for Japan. As soon as my troops were in position, I took Japan as well and started the war with China right after. While at war with China, I cleaned up Europe. And that's about it! If you've got any questions or ideas on how to do this even quicker, I'm more than happy to answer and/or read your suggestions!

edit: Forgot to mention that I made some rules for myself: No alliances, no puppets and just one Field General to accumulate all the experience.

&gt;Why do grizzly bears need to be restored to the North Cascades?

Grizzly bears are at high risk of extirpation, or going locally extinct, in the North Cascades. Restoring a self-sustaining population would contribute to the restoration of biodiversity in the ecosystem for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations. With the restoration of fishers (anticipated in the next few years) and grizzly bears, the North Cascades would be one of the few ecosystems left in the contiguous United States that has the full complement of carnivore species known to be native prior to European settlement. Such biodiversity can be an indication of a healthy ecosystem. Restoring grizzly bears to the North Cascades would enhance the probability of long-term survival and conservation of grizzly bears in the contiguous United States, thereby contributing to overall grizzly bear recovery, and supporting the eventual removal of grizzly bears from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife Species.

&gt; Manowar is a metal band from Auburn, New York, United States that prominently features mythology and fantasy in their lyrics as well as songs about Heavy Metal and a theme of camaraderie with rebellious attitude.

&gt; Manowar was founded by bassist Joey DeMaio and guitarist  Ross ""Ross the Boss"" Friedman in 1980. Joey DeMaio was a bass/pyro technician for Black Sabbath, who were playing a show in England at the time, and Ross the Boss was the guitarist of a band called Shakin' Street. The whole thing started when the two locked themselves in a locker room to find out which one could play the guitar harder and faster.

&gt; After agreeing that they would found a band, the two took in Eric Adams, the ""man with lungs of leather"", as their vocalist, and Donny Hamzik as their drummer. They released their first album, ""Battle Hymns"", with this lineup in 1982. On their second release, ""Into Glory Ride"" (1983), Scott Columbus was introduced as their new drummer, along with his custom made stainless steel drums (regular ones would not endure his aggressive style).  The contract for Into Glory Ride was also signed in the band's own blood. 

&gt; Manowar's third album, Hail to England (1984), started a tour in Great Britain. However, the band were fed up with their current record company's dominant nature, and released yet another record during the same year; ""Sign of the Hammer"" was published by 10 Records - hence the song ""All Men Play on 10"" included on this album.

&gt; In the beginning of 1987, ""Fighting the World"" was released, featuring hit songs such as ""Fighting the World"", ""Black Wind, Fire and Steel"" and ""Defender"". Followed by a tour in Europe, ""Fighting the World"" was a success.

&gt; Their next album, ""Kings of Metal"" (1988), was widely dedicated to the fans of Manowar all around the world, as can be told by looking at the cover (plenty of different flags scattered around). This album also featured recordings with a large male choir, such as ""Blood of the Kings"" and ""The Crown and the Ring (Lament of the Kings)"". The title of this album is the reason that their fans (and also themselves) dub them ""The Kings of Metal"".

&gt; Not being pleased by his career with Manowar, Ross the Boss quit the band at this point, and was replaced by David Shankle. Also, the drummer known as ""Rhino"" took Scott Columbus's place on Manowar's next release, ""The Triumph of Steel"" published in 1992. After finishing their ""Secrets of Steel"" tour, they were voted as the band that fans would most like to see in Russia, beating out Beatles and Michael Jackson.

&gt; 1996 saw the release of ""Louder than Hell"", with Scott Columbus back in the drums and a new talent, Karl Logan, in lead guitar. This album included hit tracks ""Gods Made Heavy Metal"", ""The Power"", ""Brothers of Metal (Pt.1)"" and ""Return of the Warlord"".

&gt; After some more touring and the change of millennium, ""Warriors of the World"" was released in 2002, featuring tracks ""Warriors of the World (United)"" and one dedicated to Italian fans, ""Nessun Dorma"", which was earlier performed by Eric Adams on their show in Italy.

&gt; Manowar has also released six live-DVD's, ""Hell on Earth"" Parts I-V and ""The Day the Earth Shook - The Absolute Power"", with the unbelivable event of the 2005 Earthshaker festival.  A new EP called ""Sons of Odin"" was released in October 2006.  Their latest album was released at the end of February - beginning of March 2007, entitled ""Gods Of War"".

&gt; Also in 2007 Manowar started their own metalfest in Bad Arolsen, Germany, which is called the Magic Circle Festival.

&gt; In August 2008 Manowar released an one-song single,  'Die With Honor'. The song was also edited for the latest ""Thunder in the sky"" EP, part of ""The Asgard Saga"" forthcoming CD. The EP included the song ""Father"" recorded in 15 more languages other than English-another tribute of the band to their faithful fans all around the world!

“**Sex, birth, and rebirth**” are pagan?  The first two items (sex &amp; birth) are not “pagan”, unless you’re asserting that every living organism engaging in sexual reproduction is “pagan”.  In regard to “rebirth”, that’s a common theme in just about every religion—from the buddhist “reincarnation” to the Christian evangelical “born again” dogma.  Some of the soundtrack’s lyrics were tailored to the plot, but that still doesn’t make any of your examples “pagan”.  Check Wikipedia’s entry on the film’s soundtrack.  Most of the soundtrack (featuring the band Magnet) uses British/Scottish/Irish traditional folk music.  

The “Maypole” is the closest thing to a uniquely pagan artifact, but the modern Christmas tree (not mentioned once in the Christian bible) is a direct descendant of the Maypole and European tree worship. So even the Maypole was adopted by Christianity.

This [style of lager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuncts) is not known for its taste in warm temperatures. I think it is safe to say most agree that it tastes terrible unless very cold. Many American's people associate this style with relaxing on a warm caribbean beach. I believe this is unique to the Americas, north, central and south. In Europe you'll find plenty of pilsner style and especially predominant in around the mediterranean but you will also equally find various other more complex styles. In the United States adjunct lagers are widely dominant especially when you leave areas where craft brewing has become popular. It has become a cultural aspect of the America's that these cereal based or adjunct lagers are what is thought of when discussing beer and also the cold temperatures that go along with them. I certainly could not imagine drinking a budweiser warm, yuck. 

Many, if not most, beer styles should be consumed slightly chilled or warmer and are most enjoyable in that range. Keep in mind beer was made long before refrigeration came about. Many more complex recipe's will lose their flavor if over chilled. These adjunct lagers are an exception to the typical 4 ingredient rule.

,PortugalBot,,,"&gt; r/portugal *-* Vidas de sal ([2 comentários](https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/6kls7h/))

## É um grão comparado com o que foi há apenas um século. Mas ainda encontramos salinas onde se produz como antes, só com sol, mar e vento.

Antes de chegar à foz, o Mondego divide-se em dois braços que depois se encontram novamente para desaguar juntos no mar. Entre eles, está a ilha da Murraceira, 600 hectares de sapais, caniçais, juncais e salinas, vizinhos da Figueira da Foz. É por aqui que seguimos, percorrendo uma estrada estreita em terra batida, entre talhos e tanques de aquacultura, ou talhões abandonados.

Gilda Saraiva pára em frente ao esqueleto de um pequeno armazém de madeira. Há vários por aqui, muitos ao abandono, outros a ser recuperados. Os armazéns eram construídos com troncos em cruz para se adaptarem às oscilações do terreno, causadas pelas movimentações das águas, num sistema de gaiola, explica esta marnoteira formada em Arquitectura. Tinham que ser feitos em madeira, para resistir à oxidação que o sal provoca, num sistema de encaixe que dispensa pregos. Esta saiu do pinhal de Leiria.

Seguimos. Vemos pernilongos, andorinhas do mar, uma menina a chapinhar na água, tal como Gilda fazia quando tinha a idade dela (tem agora 37 anos). Chegamos à salina dos Doutores, uma sucessão de rectângulos em cinzento escuro, rodeados de plantas.

As limpezas começaram no início de Maio e continuam. Estamos em Junho. “Tirámos o lodo e as algas que nasceram no Inverno”, afirma. “É preciso retirar toda a água, a argila fica rija e já se pode andar lá em cima. Recolhemos a lama, transportamos para montes e depois de dois Invernos, já sem salitre, usamos na agricultura, porque é rica em sais minerais”.

Gilda Saraiva não é só uma marnoteira. Faz também agricultura biológica aliada à salina: figos, morangos, mirtilos, ervas aromáticas (que adiciona ao sal), alhos, cebolas... O sal não é assim tão diferente. “Também há anos maus. Se chove no Verão não há sal, ou demora mais tempo”. A safra vai de Maio até às primeiras chuvas de Setembro. “Pelo meio, nunca sabemos.” Se tudo correr bem, pode produzir 100 toneladas de sal e duas toneladas de flor de sal, embalado nos pacotes Amor com Sal q.b. “A técnica? Todos os anos a salina nos ensina, porque todos os anos é diferente”.

A limpeza leva um mês e “é a fase mais dura”. É por isso que o seu pai, Carlos Cardenho, tirou férias da fábrica de vidros, para a vir ajudar. “Quem corre por gosto... O provérbio não sai por acaso”, diz enquanto liberta placas de lama endurecida do fundo de um talho, que amontoa a um canto. Depois, passa-se um cilindro, para o solo ficar liso.

Antes, as placas de lama eram levadas em gamelas, à cabeça de mulheres descalças. As salinas eram de grandes senhores, que pagavam aos produtores não em dinheiro mas deixando-os ficar com um terço da produção. “Eram dos senhores porquê? Porque davam dinheiro. No século XIX rendia a sério. Era o ouro branco”. “Nunca vi um empregado enriquecer”, diz Carlos Cardenho. A mulher, Lurdes, conta que o avô era marnoto – ou marnoteiro, salineiro ou marronto, como também se dizia por aqui – desde os quatro anos (um exagero, claro, mas que dá conta da tenra idade com que os habitantes da região se ligavam à produção). Ela própria vinha nas cestas de sal, com o irmão, porque a mãe não tinha com quem os deixar. “Dormíamos em cima do sal, com um xaile por baixo.”

A salina passou para as mãos do avô de Gilda, que depois a dividiu entre os filhos. A parte que coube à mãe está agora a ser explorada pela antiga arquitecta, que faz questão de a manter. “Para a maioria, isto é só um extra. Mas eu decidi que não podia emigrar, como os meus colegas. Tinha que preservar este património”.

Tomar conta de salinas era coisa de homens e Gilda é ainda hoje um caso particular – e também por ser a mais nova no salgado, afirma. Nada que a tenha impedido de se tornar presidente da FigueiraSal, a associação de produtores de sal da Figueira da Foz, onde há 45 salinas activas (em meados do século XX eram 300).

Só os homens puxavam o sal. Às mulheres cabia transportá-lo à cabeça. Era isso que faziam as avós de Gilda. Há fotografias antigas em que aparecem ambas, vestidas com saias e camisas de mangas compridas (usou-a numa das suas embalagens de flor de sal). “Era uma actividade sazonal e havia poucos empregos. Desde os 12 anos que começavam a transportar o sal. Havia cestas de 35 até aos 50 quilos”.

A bisavó Corália foi a primeira mulher a fazer todo o trabalho, garante. A bisneta seguiu as pegadas e é com orgulho que se diz “marronteira”. “Tenho uma missão: fazer com que isto se mantenha pelas gerações vindouras”. Não só por uma questão familiar. “As salinas activas garantem biodiversidade, porque as aves só têm estes locais para nidificar – o caudal da água é mais baixo e por isso conseguem pousar. São aves migratórias, que chegam na Primavera. Quando chegam os pernilongos dizemos: ‘Está na hora de preparar as salinas’”.

Entramos no barco em frente à Lota Velha. Tudo o que vemos eram marinhas (ou seja, salinas). Chegou a haver 500. Agora restam oito. Muitas estão submersas, outras ocupadas por terra.

Virgílio Porto e Virgílio Rocha levam-nos à ilha dos Puxadoiros, só acessível por barco. “Estes são os verdadeiros canais da Ria de Aveiro”. “Todas as marinhas tinham um palheiro”, com tecto feito de junco. Era ali que os marnotos vindos da serra pernoitavam. Nada resta disso.

A abertura do porto de Aveiro, em 1908, trouxe maior fluxo de água, e os muros (ou moirões) muitas vezes não resistiram. Alguns estão protegidos por pneus, que lentamente se está a tentar substituir.

Um grupo de pessoas, incluindo Virgílio Rocha, juntaram-se há nove anos à volta da “ideia idílica de ter uma ilha”. “Queríamos produzir ostras e preservar a produção de sal, manter o pousio para a produção de salicórnia e para as aves”.

A actividade sempre foi dura. “No Algarve o sal nasce, em Aveiro faz-se”, comenta Virgílio Porto, que explora a salina. Antes, produzia-se aqui entre 100 e 120 toneladas, agora 60 (e 1300 quilos de flor de sal).

Há tanques de salicórnia de um lado e talhos para o sal do outro. Os depósitos já estão prontos, com algumas manchas brancas no fundo, mas está tudo ainda sem água.

Restam quatro pirâmides de sal do ano passado, cobertas por um plástico e uma rede. “Ele escorre e seca. Pode ficar aqui uma vida inteira. Antes, quem vivia do sal tinha que o vender. Para nós, não compensa pagar um armazém”.

Henrique Pinto é o marnoto dos Puxadoiros. Conta que “a primeira rasura que se faz na marinha se vende às bruxas, nas feiras”. É o chamado sal virgem, e há quem acredite que tem poderes curativos. “É mais brilhante, as pedras não são uniformes, parecem cubinhos. As bruxas olham para o sal e sabem se é virgem ou não”.

Há vestígios de exploração do sal na costa de Aveiro nos séculos IX e X, afirma a historiadora Inês Amorim, da Universidade do Porto. “Mas só começa a ser produzido em grande escala no século XVI, XVII, para zonas consumidoras próximas, como a Galiza”, explica. “Foi um período maior para Aveiro.”

No século seguinte, mais de 500 pessoas trabalhavam nas marinhas da região: “Um terço mulheres, de quem normalmente ninguém fala. Ganhavam metade dos homens e trabalhavam na fase de água doce, a organizar os muros, limpar, fazer as divisões, solidificar o fundo, toda a parte de preparação. Vão fazer o mesmo [muito mais tarde] quando forem as obras do porto de Aveiro, ao lado dos homens, a transportar terra à cabeça porque tinham essa experiência com as marinhas.”

É no século XVIII que o sal português ganha importância, com grandes consumidores como a Suécia e os EUA, ultrapassando concorrentes como a Espanha e a Itália. Mas já é sobretudo do Sul do país que vem o “ouro branco”. “As zonas de Aveiro e da Figueira da Foz tendem a perder o peso que tinham até ao século XVII a favor de Lisboa, Setúbal e a zona do Algarve”, adianta a historiadora.

O declínio a pique viria mais tarde, alastrando-se a todo o país. “No século XIX, aparecem outras formas de conservação, a Inglaterra explora a produção mineira, os EUA começam também a ter formas de exploração. Apesar de Portugal passar a ir directamente à procura do bacalhau, na segunda metade do século XIX e início do século XX, já não há a produção de sal que houve em tempos, nem esta tem o peso que teve na economia e na política... Os concorrentes são muitos. E os custos de produção não são compatíveis.”

Quando a partir dos anos 1950 se lança um vasto inquérito à produção de sal portuguesa – que nunca voltou a ser repetido, pelo que hoje não existe um estudo global sobre as salinas do país – era já evidente a diminuição das áreas de todos os salgados portugueses.

Encontramos os sinais disso por todo o lado onde há salinas. Como no Samouco. Para se ir ter à salina, perto de Alcochete, atravessa-se uma estrada que passa por vários edifícios abandonados: a antiga fábrica de seca de bacalhau (primeiro seco ao sol, depois em estufas, até fechar definitivamente, em 1995). Dois homens trabalham junto a um talho gigantesco, rosado devido a uma micro-alga que se desenvolve ali. A ponte Vasco da Gama tem uma presença forte, ouvem-se até os carros a passar, e ao fundo seria fácil ver a zona oriental de Lisboa não fosse a neblina.

João Matias chega num tractor para explicar que havia 66 salinas espalhadas por 360 hectares, na década de 1960. Foi quando começaram a chegar as fábricas de cortiça e transformação de carnes, que atraíram muita mão-de-obra, dando emprego a tempo inteiro. Dez anos depois, já só oito ou nove salinas estavam activas; nos anos 80 só duas: esta onde estamos agora, a Marinha do Canto, e a Marinha da Providência, que era semi-mecanizada e que em 1994, com a construção da ponte, foi desactivada (e expropriada).

João Matias sabe porque assistiu a tudo. Diz-se que é o último salineiro do Tejo, região que chegou a ser o maior produtor do país. Trabalha aqui “desde sempre”, qua…",True,False,0,1498938905,moderator,False,0,djnoqwy,t3_6kp2tt,t3_6kp2tt,1499825899,1,True,portugalnews,t5_3j11u,

Literally the entire body of western medical knowledge is based on the study of men (usually white men). Until the modern era, and with some, though limited exceptions (Henrietta Lacks, for example), medical research and education was done almost exclusively on men, with men's health in mind.

Your statement is, on its very face, flat out inaccurate.  Women's health, and issues specific to women (both childbirth and overal gynecological health) has been a major source of study and concern throughout history.    

[Here](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/444183/mod_resource/content/1/Green.%20M.%20Womens%20medical%20practice%20and%20health%20care%20in%20med%20Europe.pdf), for example, is an article about the middle ages that discusses not only the importance of women's health, but it points put that women also commonly practiced medicine as well (beyond midwifery).
 
There is also voluminous evidence of medical research dating back to ancient Greece regarding women's health.  Just look up the anatomical sketches made by early physicians such as Vesalius.  
 
The idea that medicine (both ancient and modern) has been ""exclusively on men, with men's health in mind"" is utterly absurd.

Him being a hitler wouldn't be a bad thing, I mean so long as he doesn't push more migrants into Europe.

I mean Turkey has always been a difficult thing for me. I mean if you've read my other posts, then you already know I'm technically a Turk.

I took a DNA test and the results pretty much proved I'm mostly European besides the percentage of Caucasus DNA and a super tiny east Asian percentage from when the Mongols invaded probably.

No one in my family has been born in Turkey for 100 years either. Ever since Bulgaria became an independent country.

Being ""redpilled"" really has caused me some identity the problems because I look white and act white, but don't share the same history as other white nationalists. Our ancestors fought against each other, and I have some family members that fought in the Balkan wars and have never returned. No idea which side though.

I have considered changing my name and am just coming with terms that in probably a rape baby.

I'd say it's bad, because Ukraine can't join EU or NATO with region dispute. Also, the war costs money, and reforms pass slower with war because politicians use the war as an excuse to create authoritarian measures that are opposite to EU values.

&gt;Getting them back gives us vague (and questionable, given their current attitude) benefit of ability to join to EU/NATO

Somehow I doubt that so many of the population are against EU enough to aggressively vote against it tbh. Remember, they voted for Yanukovich who promised EU integration. I think they care more about Russian language and culture, and stuff like that more than about whether they join EU or not. Most of them are either apathetic about EU, or slightly anti-EU but are willing to join EU if it gives them benefits to do so. Very few, hate the EU so much that they will go out of their way to aggressively vote against.
And even if they do, they're still less than 10% of the population, so it's not likely that they sway votes so much - unless another 40% is also against it, in that case you might want to ask why.

When it comes to the refugees for me its not only those that start problems, its also those males that run instead of fighting for what is suppose to be their country.
I can understand wanting to send your wife and children to safety, and we should take them (as long as they are not financial ""refugees"", which is atleast 60%, which even the EU knows) as refugees, not immigrants.

I truely dont understand this level cowardice. If id flee from Germany, be it from Nazis, Muslims or general war, id feel reminded by every car, every radio, in my work (Hertz, or Ohm which studied at my university for some time), everytime id listen to beethoven, mozart or wagner, of my cowardice.
Im never going to flee, im ready to die, especially since i dont have wife and children. I just dont want to die for nothing.

Heck, id give them guns, explosives and Tanks if i had to. Instead we sell to the saudis, because of money, and let them finance our mosks. They build new ones, even tho the old ones should have been bulldozed years ago.

So no compassion towards those. But the ones that flee only to rape women or even children.. 
This might be a little extreme, but if i was in charge and you'd rape a women  or a child, i'd give you the choice between swimming in the north sea or getting lined up and shot.

What use is it to put people in prision that will just indoctrinate more and more people to their disgusting brand of idiology? Prison and social wellfare (which even as a conservative im not opposed of) should be a luxury for people that work hard and serve each other. Its times like this where this european thing for trying to look out for each other, gets abused heavily. It needs to be shut down for this emergency situation.

If one was never part of society, how in the hell will you reintroduce him back into it via prision? Its a pipedream and our western morality is coming back to bite us in the ass.

As for your ranting - dont worry about it sounding pseudo-demented. On the contrary. Its just so refreshing to let all this shit out and say it, because i so seldomly can. I work my arse off and so if i can find half a day on the weekend to talk to people that have not yet lost grip on reality, it makes it all worth it.

Just for the record, im not against immigration. Take the american engineer, take the russian chemist, take a black physicist from south africa if its in moderation. Make sure it benefits the german people.

What we are taking is the scum of the earth. A barbaric, religious deathcult that is thriving on enslavement and subjugation of women. This is what we are giving up the fruits of the age of enlightment for.

,DenkouNova,,,"Several things:

- The whole rights thing in the Western Europe and North America started happening in the 50's. It was only 40 years later that countries of the USSR could start thinking about asking for rights. This shows in their women's rights that aren't up to par with Western Europe -- for example, Russia recently (a few months ago) upped the bar to what can be considered domestic violence. Naturally, in terms of gay rights, they're not ""there"" yet. It seems to me you first gotta have women's rights to destroy the idea that everyone has to be married-for-life man-and-woman couples, before having gay rights.

- Many people in countries like Poland take pride in the Catholic heritage they had lost during its communist days. This comes with your usual anti-gay rhetoric. Every few months some politician in Eastern Europe says women belong in the house and that makes citizens angry.

- The Muslim regions within Russia - Chechnya, Dagestan etc. - are also enjoying their time out of Soviet Russia's iron fist with a renewed pride in their religion and ethnicity. I assume the few Muslim parts of Eastern Europe -- Albania, Bosnia -- do the same. Chechnya is extremely harsh on its homosexuals.

- Citizens in these countries might not think gay rights are something really worth fighting for, when they already have plenty on their plate, when their country has government corruption and/or political unrest (e.g. Ukraine, Kosovo).

- As someone mentioned, the political elites of Russia might not want to embrace the whole diversity thing just because it sounds Western. In the Cold War, the government of the United States had done similarly, becoming more religious just because the USSR was officially atheist.

Given your constant media brainwashing and the fact that most of your elites do not look kindly upon our project here this becomes only even more true whenever the topic is Europe.

&gt; After that, I hope it dies. 

Because you do not care about the fact that single EU countries would just be constantly bullied by outsiders, one of which is ""coincidently"" your own country.

Second, I would not spend 13 hours on the train trying to get to Zermatt from Rome. You are missing some awesome, awesome stuff. As long as you aren't driving in Rome or down south, driving in Italy is no big deal. Rent a car at the airport in Rome and drive to Siena or Florence (~3-4 hours). Spend the night in Siena/Florence. Drive to Varenna/Lakes area (~3-4 hours). Spend the night in Varenna. Drive to Zermatt (~3-4 hours). From Zermatt, you could easily drive to Zurich, spending the night in Interlaken (absolutely gorgeous) on the way. Then continue with your plans to head to Neuschwanstein from Zurich (dip down to Liechtenstein for extra-country bonus points-- or skip it and stop in St. Gallen). Munich is only an hour from there, so I would drive to Munich, turn in your car and take the train to Cologne. From there you can take the bus or train or whatever to Bielefeld and then return to Cologne. From Cologne, you can easily take the train/fly to Frankfurt, Paris, Brussels, or Amsterdam for the return trip home.

It may seem like a lot of driving, but remember there are five of you. You also have much more flexibility driving than you do catching a train or flying. Driving around the countries you want to hit is easy because its just like driving in the States (as far as basic road rules and being on the same side of the road).

I don't care, it's a loss. You want to give him credit for taking the fight then go ahead, just don't give him props for losing and you especially can't jump start him ahead of Crawford, Rigondeaux, Ward, Canelo and other P4P guys who have consistently fought better opposition and did it while undefeated with well over 20+ fights.

Canelo by that standard is the undisputed GOAT seeing as he fought Mayweather at the age of 22.

,oIIXIIo,,CANZUK,"Since the momentous result on June 23 last year, Ukip has been in some trouble.

For a quarter of a century, we were pretty much a lone voice in British politics calling for EU withdrawal. Many of those who had previously voted Ukip took the view in the recent elections that the job was now done and Ukip’s vote plunged accordingly.

My own decision to stand down as party leader last year was bound to leave a big hole. When you are such a dominant figure, it is always going to be tough for anyone to follow. Little did I know just how dramatic this period would be.

With Paul Nuttall’s resignation, we have until the end of July for candidates to throw their hat in the ring. While many have been lobbying me and urging me to come back, I have decided that this would not be the right thing to do and I will not be standing. While I remain a strong supporter of the party and think there is a real chance in two years that Ukip may be more relevant than ever, the party itself needs serious reforms.

We built Ukip from the grassroots. There were no national figures and very little money in the early days. Over years, we built a branch structure across the UK and an army of volunteers. In line with this, we devised a constitution that put power in the hands of the activists. Ukip is run by an elected NEC. The last set of elections for this body saw 93 candidates vying for just six places.

Most of those elected are enthusiastic volunteers, are all unpaid and all care about the cause. But few have any idea about campaigning, media or raising money. As Ukip grew from a tiny party to winning the European elections of 2014, I found myself increasingly frustrated with this governing body. Time and again I was outvoted on important decisions and could not take the party in the direction I wanted.

The thought of going back to a job I may not be allowed to do, if, again, I’m held back by totally unqualified people is not something I’m prepared to contemplate. I hope the new leader takes on the battle for major constitutional change or the party will return to being an amateur shambles.

It is already something of an ongoing joke about the number of times I have stood for the leadership and resigned. To return now would be premature. But I’m still committed to the great Brexit battle and I will continue in my role as the leader of a group in the European Parliament, overseeing the Brexit process.

In many ways, what happens in that parliament over the next two years is perhaps as important as everything that goes on in Westminster. Of course I want a full and proper Brexit, and if in 2019 we reach the end of the Article 50 process and a huge gap is left, whether that is not taking back our fishing rights, the continuation of free movement or still paying Brussels too much money, I would not hesitate in throwing myself back into the front line of domestic politics.

For the moment, it’s difficult to tell how this will turn out. Perhaps Jeremy Corbyn will be the one who holds the Government’s feet to the fire on Britain leaving the single market. His sacking of three shadow cabinet members hints that his old Bennite anti-EU passions are back to the fore.

There are also personal reasons for my decision. I said when I stood down that I wanted my life back. This did not mean I would spend my life sitting on a beach, but there were things I wanted to do that I simply had not been able to do as leader. I took on the establishment status quo in this country and one thing I have learnt is that they do not like to be challenged. They fight back and they fight dirty. In recent weeks, we have seen that an MP has had her office attacked. We’ve also seen Gina Miller and others going on TV talking about death threats and the unpleasantness on the internet.

Believe you me, none of these people has seen anything. I’ve had this abuse every day of my life for years. Whenever I attend a public event or drop into the local pub, the threat of violence is never far away.

Yes, I accept that politics is a rough, tough old game. But to have lived through year after year of hatred, stirred up by a media doing everything they could to stop me and Ukip progressing has had a wearing effect. To walk back willingly into a life like that is not something I want to do unless I have to. To some extent, the hatred that was around last summer does seem to have eased by not leading the party and I’ve have had the chance to do other things – such as a daily radio show and frequent trips to the US. Professionally, my life is settled and I intend to keep it that way.

None of this is meant to be negative about Ukip, its people or achievements. In many ways, it has been the most successful political movement of our times. But it is in need of real change. It must sort out its internal structures and continue to be a radical voice for change that stands up for ordinary people. However, if it does not sort itself out and make the changes necessary to become a professional, modern political party, and if then we find ourselves with a Brexit that falls short of the mark, another vehicle will then come along to replace it.",True,False,0,1498944911,,False,0,djnt0rh,t3_6kpm3a,t3_6kpm3a,1499828003,9,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,

A educação ética e moral. Geralmente vem da família e nos primeiros anos de uma criança é quando ela pega mais coisas dessa educação.  
Deve-se educar as pessoas desde a primeira infância, ensinar ""modos"", dar bons exemplos, condenar más atitudes, etc. Lembro que na escola onde eu estudava as crianças formavam grupos. Eu não percebi enquanto era criança, mas depois que cresci percebi que as crianças eram meio que um reflexo dos pais. Só que os pais (a maioria deles) são corruptos, e passam em forma de costume para as crianças, mesmo que inconscientemente, e se não forem os pais, são outras crianças e até mesmo outros adultos que passam durante processo de socialização. Eu fui à uma casa espírita desde pequeno até a adolescência. Hoje eu sou ateu e apesar disso eu reconheço que a igreja tem um papel importante dando o que a educação pública não fornece: bons modos/ensinamentos sobre moral. Sabe aquelas historinhas para crianças? E no final tem a pergunta qual é a moral da história? Aquilo era explorado na casa espírita onde eu ia, eles ensinavam sobre moral e ética (com um lado religioso, mas mesmo assim...), além de interpretação, é claro. Na escola também tinha essas historinhas mas não era a mesma coisa, era algo mais pra interpretação do que ensinar moral mesmo, não existia a discussão se era certo ou errado tal atitude na escola.

Referendums in essence are terrible ideas. We elect representatives because we are illinformed about certain matters that we need people to determine the best way forward for us. 

In reality many politicians are lazy, stupid and utterly irresponsible. A flaw of our vote for the party not the representative system. We need to fix the system. However we as a people, the 95% of us are completely unsuitable to make a decision impacting a nation. In no way would we ever be able to fully appreciate the economic, social and political implications of such a choice. We should never have been asked to decide. 

However, in a political ploy we were asked to decide. And we did. Two groups of misinformed politicians bullshitting about a future they had no idea about trying to educate the common man about what box to cross. 

This is the issue, you don't get a response from the country about the best way forward, you get the response by the best group at conveying their rhetoric. Leave were more influential on the day. 

So we should just do another vote, we all know we fucked up right? Well no, we entrusted the public with the decision and made our arguments and despite a heavily favoured remain campaign we chose to leave. That was the choice. 

Americans didn't elect Trump and then go ""no seriously guys, try again"", which we all agree was the wrong decision. They didn't say ""well of the non voters most would have picked Hillary"".  You gave us a voice and we used it, as irresponsible and misinformed the decision was. Democracy is you ask a question and take a majority answer. 

Brexit wasn't right, but spending another £15m on another campaign to reverse the decision, to land us back with a deal that is worse than we started isn't the answer. Maybe if we fix our parlimentary flaws we can ensure this doesn't happen again. In the mean time, i personally do not believe in 2nd referendums.

,goonsack,centi,MAGA,"My supposition over what would happen if I tried to bring invaders into Israel is not me talking out of my ass, I'm basing this on real precedent. Israel protects its country from anything it perceives as a threat with lethal force. Example is the [raid on the Gaza flotilla from Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid). The boats were in international waters when Israeli commandos boarded and attacked. They shot nine civilians to death and a tenth later died in hospital. 

&gt;Most Israelis however are right of center and we had a center-right government for about a decade now. To suggest that somehow most Israelis support that, and that this is some kind of an evil plan of ours (and our government's) to destabilize Europe or whatever is fucking nuts.

Many Jews and Israelis have a complete double standard about refugees and migrants when it comes to their own ethnostate versus the homelands of European peoples and other traditionally European-derived Western nations like the USA. I know that the right wing in Israel is in power and protects its own demographics doggedly. But they do not consistently apply this logic to countries that aren't theirs. 

You seem to be suggesting here  that there are only two factions of Jews: those who are against mass immigration and multiculturalism in both the West and Israel, and those who are for it in both the West and Israel. This is simply not true. There is in fact a sizeable third faction that is against it when it comes to Israel but for it when it comes to the West.

In fact, the view of America as a multicultural/multiethnic collective (an idea that did not exist when America was founded) was very much shaped by people from the third faction. 

Two of the most oft-cited refrains to justify this multicultural/multiethnic utopian vision -- the ""[melting pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Melting_Pot_(play))"" of America and the ""[give me your tired, your poor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus)"" -- were inventions of Zionist Jews ([Israel Zangwill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Zangwill) and [Emma Lazarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Lazarus)). They both (hypocritically) promoted the view of America as an open doors nation (supplanting its traditional status as a nation of Western European stock) while simultaneously advocating for an ethnically pure homeland for their own people as leading Zionists.

&gt;Israel (edit - and Jewish communities worldwide) definitely have far left fringes who are pushing suicidal policies for Israel and I wouldn't be surprised if they take part in the pro rapefugee stuff as well. 

It's not just a fringe though. Let's take the refugee controversy in America and American rabbis as an example. 

Refugee contractor HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) claims scriptural justification of ""welcoming the stranger"" for refugee importation.

https://www.hias.org/2000rabbis

They also got 2000 American rabbis (a majority of them) to sign onto their pro-refugee letter.

So it's not just secular American Jews that want open borders, in fact it seems that [2001](https://www.hias.org/2000rabbis) out of [3209](http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/RABBI.asp) rabbis in America (62.4%) want to continue importing refugees into the USA through the resettlement program. And about 300,000 (32.7%) of all refugees imported since 9/11 have actually been Muslim (source is Wrapsnet http://ireports.wrapsnet.org/) despite Muslims only making up 24% of the world population at large.

Meanwhile only [36% of Americans at large](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/08/16/poll-most-americans-oppose-syrian-refugee-resettlement-in-u-s/) support resettling Syrian migrants in the US (The Syrians resettled in the US are about 97% Sunni Muslim).

Of course there are Jews opposed to mass immigration, we're obviously not talking about a monolithic group, but the level of support for open borders among leaders of the Jewish faith/community is really quite striking. 

The mass importation of third worlders into America is apparently one of the few issues that various Jewish sects can agree upon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbLfb1EvSxw

,blaztoys,,,"Eu merg foarte mult pe jos, aproape zilnic. In jur de 50 de kilometri pe saptamana. Ma rog, nu stiu daca e foarte mult, asa consider eu. Nu-mi place transportul in comun, mai ales in perioada asta, iar masina nu am, inca. Traind intr-un oras mic, ajung repede la pas dintr-un loc in altul. Fie ca am treaba, fie ca ma plimb, prefer sa merg pe jos. De cele mai multe ori, imi place sa procesez la un nivel mai profund ce se intampla in jurul meu. Sunt atent si la schimbarile care au loc aici. Cine si-a mai pus termopan, cine si-a schimbat masina, cine se mai muta, cine se mai cearta, cine se mai impaca, cine mai sta pe la terase. Multe chipuri sunt cunoscute, dar imi place mai mult sa cunosc persoane noi. Mai intru in vorba cu oameni singuri, de cele mai multe ori tristi, care sunt spitalizati si mai ies undeva intr-un parculet la o inghetata, sau sa mai traga o gura de aer proaspat. Pentru unii viata e pe terminate, pentru altii abia incepe. Asa am descoperit ca in spitale sunt si oameni sanatosi, dar pensionati ilegal pe caz de boala, asa ca trebuie sa bifeze cateva zile de spitalizare anual, ca asa spune legea. Pentru acesti oameni spitalizarea e un fel de concediu. Betivii sunt haiosi si oarecum interesanti, de obicei ei se baga in seama. Am dat odata peste un betiv absolut fabulos. De fapt, el a dat peste mine. Trecea pe langa mine, eu stateam pe o banca, si de nicaieri m-a intrebat ce adancime are Groapa Marianelor. M-a mai plimbat prin geografie, literatura si astronomie. Cred ca am vorbit vreo ora cu el. Era cadru didactic iesit la pensie si tare mandru imi spunea ce fericit e ca fetele lui i-au calcat pe urme, fiind si ele profesoare. Se intampla sa trec des pe langa o florarie. Afacerea merge destul de prost. Locatia e destul de aiurea, iar locul e urat amenajat. Nu stiu, mie nu-mi place. Parca n-as cumpara flori de acolo. De cateva luni, acolo vinde flori o fata noua. Are 23 de ani, e blonda, parul scurt, destul de inalta (pe la 1,70) si are ochii albastri. Ce mi s-a parut suprinzator la ea e faptul ca o vedeam mereu trista. De cele mai multe ori sta incovoiata pe scaun, priveste in gol, cu mainile incrucisate. Uneori o vad zambind fortat, cand mai pregateste un buchet de flori pentru un client. Mereu cand o vedeam ma intrebam de unde atata tristete. De ce ar fi trista o fata inconjurata de flori? Apoi mi-a venit in minte un raspuns destul de simplu. Degeaba sta printre flori, daca niciuna nu e pentru ea. Cum si o femeie care vinde bjiuterii poate fi trista, pentru ca nicio bijuterie nu e pentru ea. Si tot asa. Asa ca mi-am zis sa ii fac o surpriza. In ziua in care o voi vedea mai trista ca niciodata, voi intra in florarie si o sa ii fac o surpriza. Ziua asta a fost ieri. A fost o zi absolut minunata, iar la ora 18:24 treceam prin fata florariei. M-am uitat la ea si se vedea ca a plans. Avea ochii rosii si umflati. Am zis, gata, asta e ziua! Intru in florarie si o salut. Se ridica de pe scaun si se sterge la ochi, ceeea ce intareste si mai tare ideea ca a plans. Imi raspunde la salut si ma intreaba cu ce ma poate ajuta. Ii spun ca vreau un buchet de flori. Ma intreaba de care, din ce flori. Ii spun ca habar nu am, ca nu am un obicei in a oferi flori. I-am zis, insa, ca am nevoie de cel mai frumos buchet de flori pe care il poate face. ""E pentru cineva cu totul si cu totul deosebit"", i-am zis. S-a uitat ciudat la mine si mi-a zis ca e o cerere rara asta. I-am zis ca am incredere in ea si ca sigur o sa imi placa buchetul pe care il va pregati. Cat timp selecta florile, le lega si ce mai facea ea, purtam o discutie absolut banala. E cald afara, s-ar putea sa ploua, bine ar fi sa ninga, ce bine ar fi la mare, etc. In timp ce vorbea si pregatea florile, o priveam. Habar nu avea ca isi pregateste propriul buchet. Nu stiu de ce m-am gandit la un calau care isi pregateste, fara sa stie, propria executie. ""56 de lei face,"". Mi s-a parut putin. Am platit, mi-a dat bon. I-am zis sa se uite bine la buchetul ala si sa imi confirme ca e cel mai frumos buchet pe care l-a facut vreodata. A bolborosit un da timid, cred ca era si un pic jenata. Am luat buchetul si l-am privit atent. Habar nu am ce flori erau, dar am observat niste culori frumoase. Mult bleu si alb si foarte mult bun-gust. Simplu, dar deosebit. Nu era niciun trandafir. Logic, ar fi fost prea banal. I-am zis ""Ei bine, e al tau. Pentru tine a fost tot timpul"". Parea ca s-a pierdut. A urmat un moment de tacere. Deodata, m-a asaltat cu o groaza de intrebari. I-am spus si ei ce v-am spus si voua, in mare. Mi-a multumit si mi-a zis ca nu s-ar fi asteptat niciodata. M-a intrebat cati am am, cum ma cheama, cu ce ma ocup si alte o suta de mii de intrebari. N-am raspuns decat la una (personala), legata de varsta mea. Facand schimb de varste, asa am aflat ca are 23 de ani. Eu tot dadeam sa plec si ea tot ma intreba tot felul de lucruri. I-am zis ca nu-i obligatoriu sa demontam in 5 minute orice mister. ""Ce bine ca esti, ce mirare ca sunt!"", la urma urmei. Am intrebat-o daca are de gand sa-si dea demisia azi. A zis, mirata, ca nu. Eu i-am zis ca n-am de cand sa ma mut din oras. Ideea e ca ne vom mai vedea, mai des ca oricand, incepand cu acel moment. Si uite asa ne-am luat ramas bun, fara sa ne stim nici macar numele. Ma uit pe prognoza meteo si vad ca urmeaza doua zile de ploi. Eu mi-am zis ca ma duc marti, cand termina programul, sa o invit sa mergem sa mancam ceva. Cred ca o sa ii fie foame, ma gandesc ca ar fi oportun. Nu stiu ce va fi. Ar putea fi inceputul unei povesti deosebite sau ar putea fi un final sec.

,Dylan0812,221,A Million Times Hotter Than Flamini,"I suspect the bigger issue would be wages as Arsenal has a huge wage bill. The club can facilitate offering new contracts to Alexis and Özil by cutting deadwood and fringe players however it's unlucky that the club will cut players to accommodate those who don't wish to stay. 

A team's wage bill cannot increase by more than £7 million per season unless it's covered by increased revenue such as ticket sales, transfers, European football, and commercial deals. Our revenue is unlikely to increase enough because we've dropped out of the Champions League and we'd struggle to generate it from transfers which means we'd have to focus on cutting the wage bill.

It's possible that selling Alexis and therefore cutting around £7 million wages may allow the club to offer players such as Özil, Ramsey, and the Ox better contracts and it could allow the likes of Szczesny to return to the first team. As well as making it easier to recruit new players.  

It's a pretty shitty situation but the club is left with either accomodating an expensive player who doesn't want to stay at the club then lose him on a free or get around £50-60 mil and bring in (or keep) those who want to play for Arsenal.

It is a model commonly supported by minarchists.

,Aricil,,,"In large part, yes. The average GDP of an individual in those countries is usually higher than a typical American. Also, those countries don't have a diverse range of populations as we do (although due to immigration the native populations of these countries are changing dramatically. Some show that countries such as Sweden will have less indigenous people than others by 2066). Historically Americans have felt that having to pay for others health insurance to poorer populations was a form of reparations. Today, while there are probably some segments which still believe this, I feel it's more to do with people like myself, who've been hit rather hard by attempts to change said system (in my personal case, insurance going up by over 300 dollars a month where it was before, leading me to not even have insurance where I once did). Not to mention humans have always had a sense of tribalism and a social welfare state tends to prosper in societies that are relatively homogeneous. I just think it's disingenuous to say, ""oh, American healthcare is terrible and other countries are better while spending less money"" without looking at all the contributing factors to that same system, and how changing it has led to worse coverage and costs. There's also a few other points, where there is a system in place where poorer people can write off health costs (although I'm not sure what the total amounts to, but I know anecdotally of many people I've met who've done so, even those relatively well-off who just chose not to have insurance. I'd love to see some hard numbers on what actually gets written off to the tax payer) as well as the aforementioned long waits for some procedures such as people dying while waiting on a liver, etc. I'm not saying that we have a perfect healthcare system, far from it, just that copying and pasting what systems they have in European countries won't necessarily work in America, and the changes made with the ACA has been a huge curfuffle and certainly I think has harmed more than helped. I think some form of public care for colds, minor illnesses, anti-biotics in addition to market-driven healthcare would be the closest thing to work here in the States, but even that will probably never happen.

Also you might have missed the Manchester Arena bombing in the UK recently where 23 people died? 

Violence happens everywhere. Suicides happen everywhere. There are 40+ countries (including several European nations) with higher suicide rates than the USA.

,goonsack,centi,MAGA,"&gt;kek you show the Gaza flotilla thing as an example to base your claim that if you come to Israel with refugees you will be shot to death? That's hilarious. The Gaza flotilla thing was about breaking the Israeli siege on Gaza, which is there because Gaza is ruled by Hamas. HAMAS happens to be a terrorist organization with a very long history of terror attacks that include suicide bombings of public places and public transportation, shooting attacks and launching rockets (from Gaza).

&gt;The folks on the flotilla were offered to have their goods unloaded in Israel, checked and then passed on to Gaza. They rejected the offer and kept going. When the army sent in the special forces, they were welcomed by crazed lefty and muslim with bats, knives and were attacked when they boarded. The special forces were given lousy paintball guns to board the flotilla with, and as soon as they boarded they were attacked and lynched by the lovely crowd of ""peace activists"".

If Europeans helped smuggle boatloads of Arab Muslims from Syria or North Africa into Israel under the guise of humanitarianism I think there would absolutely be a confrontation with Israeli authorities that could become violent and result in shooting. Quite possible that boats would be interdicted at sea just as the Turkish convoy was.

And if it came to it, Israelis like you would rationalize the shooting of these folks in much the same way that you have just rationalized the shooting of the flotilla activists. You would paint them as the aggressors, question their agenda/motive, and decry them or their human cargo as being in league with Israel's enemies e.g. Hamas.

as for mass shootings and accidents, there are very very very few, considering there are 330+ MILLIONS people here, w/ as many guns.  Accidents are preventable and don't victimize others except one's own self or family.  So nobody really cares about that, like they do 'mass shootings' where they fear being a victim.  And mass shootings can be defended against if people would be allowed CCW and we got rid of 'gun free zones' which don't work.  
As for EU legislation, mass shootings are becoming more and more and more common in the EU despite all of their strict laws.  Which is why there are growing movements to get rid of some of those laws...like in Czech right now.  
Either way, 'loose' laws can't be tightened in the US.  Prohibition on alcohol didn't work at all.  Our war on drugs hasn't worked at all.  Try that bullshit with guns and the results will be worse.

That court still ruled that it is a form of gambling, Now going by what has been going on over here in the UK and EU, Our courts may even rule against CCP on the issue, The US isn't the only place in the world and other places have different laws.

And just to add, EU is a lot more strict when it comes to forcing a company to stop activities they don't like, they don't just slap on the wrist, CCP can expect a Multi-million $ fine plus the threat of having access to EU states blocked if they continue.

&gt; Casiopea/カシオペア was a Japanese jazz fusion band that was formed in 1976 by guitarist Issei Noro and bassist Tetsuo Sakurai. In 1977, keyboardist Minoru Mukaiya and drummer Takashi Sasaki joined the group. The group debuted with the album Casiopea in 1979, and 30 albums or more have since been released. In 1980, the drummer seat is replaced by 神保彰/Akira Jimbo.

&gt; The album Eyes of the Mind was released in the United States in 1981. They then released the album Mint Jams in 1982, followed by Four by Four in the same year, which is a collaborative album with some of Fourplay members including Lee Ritenour, Harvey Mason, Nathan East and Don Grusin. Their first foreign concert was held in the United Kingdom in 1983. The group has toured Europe, South America, Australia, and Southeast Asia.

&gt; In 1989, 神保彰/Akira Jimbo and Tetsuo Sakurai left the band following several years of musical differences. They named their own band, Jimsaku. For the replacement, the group chose Yoshihiro Naruse (bass) and Masaaki Hiyama (drums).

&gt; In 1993, the group once again change its members. Noriaki Kumagai came to replace Masaaki. Then from 1997 神保彰/Akira Jimbo returned to Casiopea, this time as a part-time member, recording more albums and again contributing some of the compositions.

&gt; In 2006, Issei Noro, the group's leader, decided to freeze all activities of the band until further notice. Read more on Last.fm.

I would love to work with music when I leave and my wife is actually researching about a conservatory or something so I can have a musical career. Even my sister in law that lives in US and would like if we go there is trying to find me some music study in Florida, but its harder.

This may be useful for you as well in case you want to keep doing music, since I'm having a hard time playing I though of moving to composition, I feel so good when I compose something that I'm thinking of stuyding it as a career and even work with it instead of engineering, Schumann did it when he had an injury on his finger and coudn't play piano anymore.

Today, only with some keyboard and computer its very easy to record with such beautiful sounds. You just need some VST sounds, and some program called DaW, I can tell you more about it if you want to compose. Its different than playing but rewarding as well.

This is a test recording I did, please dont mind the title.

Music is the real magic in the world, It helps much in any situation, I feel is something so linked to the soul, even when I play my piano my cat jumps above it and the dog comes as well and sits near the pedals, they just stay there listening, it never ceases to amaze me.

These countries were all at their respective lowest points in history (19th century) compared to other countries on the globe, PRECISELY when they were the most xenophobic and isolationistic. As a contrast, these countries reached its zenith, or will reach their zenith as they pursue open policies and attract foreign movement, capital, and culture.

Japan became a world power EXACTLY because they stopped being so homogenous, isolationist, xenophobic, and literally shipped hundreds of thousands of students overseas to European countries to learn their technology and political structures. Within fifty years they adopted much of the western world's features, and with that they stood as an imperialist nation on their own right. Homogeneity was NOT Japan's strength, it was willingness to look beyond uniformity and national character to other countries and adopt what is good and practical. Japan inviting Prussian military advisors and English economists and American doctors is not being homogenous, it is being, *shocker* (((globalist)))

Korea was on the receiving end of imperialism and other foreign powers precisely when it was pursuing an aggressive isolationistic and xenophobic policy. It is now the strongest it has ever been, with the most global renown it has ever had. AND GUESS WHAT? It has the most amount of interracial marriages, foreign students, immigration, and cultural exchange programs ever. Diversity is Korea's strength, NOT homogeneity. More Korean people speak a foreign language now than ever, and more Korean students leave Korea for a period of study or work than ever.

Same with China, it was at the weakest point in the 19th century when it looked only to itself as a source of normative good, ignoring anything that could be of good of foreign origin. It is currently rising as a superpower in its own right, and guess what... it is the most diverse and open it has ever been to foreign influence, citizens, and investment ever in the last fifty years!

,400lb_Russian,russia,RUS,"Assad agreed to put in a pipeline bringing Russian oil to Europe. There were many attempts to stop this, including the U.S. orchestrated overthrow of the Ukrainian government. Russia got around this by taking Crimea, [through which another one of its gas pipelines now flows as of 2016](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-one-economic-reason-russias-invasion-of-crimea-pulls-in-europe-2014-3). The important aspect of this is that the Russian pipeline will sell oil exclusively through the Ruble. You have to use the Russian currency to buy the oil. Russia, still freeing itself from its Bolshevik roots, created this currency to be free of Rothschild control. Selling oil in the Ruble is Russia's attempt to strengthen the currency, which the Rothschilds are exercising their influence worldwide to devalue (so that Russia has to go back to using the cartel's money).

Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. also have plans for a pipeline through Syria, which Assad turned down. The oil from that pipeline would have to be bought in petrodollars. Israel also discovered huge oil and gas deposits offshore, and in the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights are Syrian territory. That is why Obama and Hillary created Isis, and fomented the civil war in Syria. They want Assad out so they can scrap the Russian pipeline and install their own. This will also facilitate Israel's land grab of the Golan Heights. This is why Isis was created, why we are arming them, and why we just shot down a Syrian jet that was killing them.
The Federal Reserve and its counterparts overseas can detonate the U.S. economy with the stroke of a pen.

We do already have deals with them, but they could be better. The EU is quite protectionist when it comes to trading with non-EU countries. And you mention influence: all of those countries would be willing to give us free trade deals, it's the protectionist influence of even one single EU member that can cause free trade deals to be derailed (take Italy for example) - why should we be punished with bad trade agreements when if we were bargaining on our own then we would be unobstructed by EU protectionism?

&gt;Germany already kicks out undesirable immigrants under existing EU laws.  The UK has the same right but has failed to use them.  Why not?

The laws I heard of (maybe you're referring to different ones) are laws which allow us to ask foreign EU citizens to leave if they haven't found work within 3 months and there is no likely way that they can get work in the future. I'd like to know Germany's numbers on that since I imagine that the number of people actually asked to leave is relatively insignificant, especially in comparison to the million or so migrants it has taken in over the last few years. Surely you would accept that having more control over immigration is better than having less control, even if you disagree with the rest of the advantages.

&gt;Depending on how you count, the EU has made nowhere near even half of UK laws.  Estimates range from 13% upwards.  We already have self-determination and sovereignty over our own laws.

I'm not sure that simply counting the number of laws that we inherit from the EU is an accurate method of measuring how much we are legally influenced by them.

It's actually not my opinion at all. The collection of reviews out there have made it very clear how ""well"" the OP5 camera performs. Both the sensor as well as the lack of OIS, make it noticably inferior to all the flagship competitors in image quality: G6, S8, U11, XZ Premium, P10, etc. Its camera is in fact competitve against other mid-range phones, like the Mi6. 

OP made a stupid decision in adding two cameras. It has led to them inserting the display upside down (creating an issue that possibly can never been fixed) and doing a whole lot of compromises in terms of thickness, battery sizes, etc. that comes with two cameras. It has meant an all-round more expensive phone. But most importantly it has meant the loss of a single, good camera, with larger pixels (for picking up more light), OIS, possibly better sensor and more. All this for a second camera that basically only does a mediocre bookeh effect and 1.6x zoom....

&gt;nd Xiaomi phones are for China, no one in their right mind is importing a phone bro with no support and maybe missing bands off some flakey sites

Lol, and the OnePlus 5 somehow is purchased in your average local store? GTFO with your bullshit man. For years OnePlus flagships have been only available online, and now that you can purchase them in a few select stores, you suddenly act cocky? OP5 still is a very limited phone not available in most retail stores around the world; the majority of its users will purchase it only. As for ""flakey sites""; the site I referred to was Oppomart, a large store controlled by Oppo; you know, the parent company of your favorite OnePlus. It's also one of the most popular sites to order the OnePlus 5 from...Xiaomi can be purchased by the very same retailers that sell OnePlus 5. Here in Norway we have two retailers who import the phone (as well ast he OP5), giving them Norwegian warranties. I'm pretty sure you can purchase the phone with supported bands in all other European and NA countries as well -- you are welcome to prove me wrong.

Furthermore, since you brought up ""flakey""; the customer service of OnePlus is the very definition of ""flakey"". Proof is provided almost daily on this sub (the most recent incident being their refusal to admit/acknowledge or talk honestly about the Jelly scroll).

Numerical quotas are misguided, proportional quotas using the formula that Germany uses as a template for internal distribution of peoples — that the proportion of people sent to each country in Europe be calculated by factoring in the population and economic strength of each state and it's proposition of the European population and economy as a whole — is fine.

United Nations statistical data contradicts you. Nearly half of the refugees are under 16, of those over 16 the gender balance is proportionate to the Arab world — slightly more female than male. More young men make the journey first while leaving their wives in a camp, because they want to be able to support their families before sending for them.


&gt;Europe is not a homogenous place, but Poland is by a long shot; a lot of people prefer to keep it that way.


Poland's homogeneity is a historical anomaly that is a result of the worst war in history and the country being the victim of back to back oppression by the two most evil governments in European history. I see no reason why this state of homogeneity should be preserved. I see no reason why it should be hand wrung over if it stays either, but if a change happens, who cares?

You should use reagent test kits to verify the presence of MDMA in your pill. If no MDMA is detected, it would be wise not to consume the pill.

&gt; ### Which reagent tests should I use?

&gt; * If you're in the US: Marquis and Simon's
&gt; * If you're in Europe: Marquis and Froehde

For US users, test kits are available from DanceSafe, on Amazon, Ebay, and other sites. For UK and European users, test kits are available from Reagent Tests UK, HUP, and more.

,H0vis,,,"Well the thing is, I'm British, so there's two factors that give Merkel a huge lift in my judgement relative to the local politicians, and why I had thought her to be the best of a bad bunch.

1. The refugee thing was incredible. In the UK our daily newspapers think nothing of describing refugees as cockroaches. Our government made a concerted, and successful, effort to shut down even taking in a couple of thousand refugee *children*. Our media was running stories claiming they weren't children, even claiming we should *measure their teeth* to prove they were not really kids. I'm coming from a country that would literally rather be dirt poor than allow refugees onto its soil (and yes, sigh, I know leaving the EU won't change the situation regarding refugees, but we're not a smart people). So what Merkel did by taking in refugees absolutely blew me away. I have seriously never seen anything like that.

2. She has her flaws, many of them. But she is competent. The UK has not had a competent human being in any senior government role for nearly a decade. Not just the leaders, our political class is not merely corrupt they are absolutely terrible at the job they chose to dedicate their lives to. We're sliding into the most difficult period in our post-war history and we're doing it under the leadership of utter fools. We fucking doomed.

So, yeah, that's why I had a soft spot for the Merks. Also I like that she didn't take any shit from Putin.

I wouldn't worry about your older generations being a bit of a lost cause, we have the same here, and I suspect it's the same all over. It's not something we can change, short of murdering all the elderly and that'd probably be unconscionable. My plan is not to help them onto the boats when the global warming disaster they saddled us with drops everybody into the sea, so then it's not my fault. :)",True,False,0,1498959489,,False,0,djo2m4n,t3_6ki71j,t1_djo1h2b,1499832622,1,False,GamerGhazi,t5_33oia,

1. IF russia hacked the US election, this means russia is better and illusion of strength and control and power is nothing but an illusion. There needs to be real internal change to ensure something better for the country. 

2. Russia didnt hack the election and the elections were and are rigged and the system itself is corrupt. The scapegoat that is russia is just a diversion to try and get control over the divided nation, and embarrassment that is the current state of US politics. = There needs to be real internal change to ensure something better for the country. 

3. Russia and US, and a whole lot of other nations are involved in espionage, cyber warfare, corrupt influence. (US alone has a little thing called lobbying, so there system from ground up is open to corruption). There needs to be real internal change to ensure something better for the country. 

4. The russia is a threat narrative is currently masking the constant war crimes committed by US armed forces to establish political and economic will of the 'shadow' 'deep state' government of the US (and there is one, since leaders change, parties change, country stays the same). To offset the blame for not having someone at least half presentable bea leader of the nation (who isnt a completely different person who the people are actually behind, because that would once again bring to light this 'deep state'. There needs to be real internal change to ensure something better for the country. 

5. Russia did influence the election through established US channels, as a big fuck you for Yeltsin the russian dimwit president of the 90s who was hand in hand with the US. ANd trump is their fuck you joke to the US letting the world know russia is an independent sovereign state and can and is allowed to do what US has been doing for the last 50 years. (Which looking at current trump events doesnt really mean anything because the just shut hismouth and is doing what he is told). There needs to be real internal change to ensure something better for the country. And the external influence of US on the world. 

6. We need a world government, but not one that is heavily influenced by any one nation. NATO is heavily funded by US and hence it is against russia and any enemy of US. EU is heavily influenced US and when Germany tried to take charge of the EU, it is now flooded with refugees as well as other things. and Brexit is just another step in this (US will show you what will happen if you dont adhere to its plans of globalisation). There needs to be real internal change to ensure something better for the country, so that the rest of the world feels safe having US as an ally and not an overbearing bully.

,foofad,,,"Minor correction - It wasn't due entirely to hundreds of years of metalworking experience. What makes complete leg harnesses work (as in, protection from the toes all the way up to the hips) is the supporting garments. There's a huge cultural difference not only in the way armor is made but also in the way armor is conceived of being worn, between east and west. 

If you consider the shape of the leg, it's widest at the hips and then gets narrow toward the knees, where it then enlarges again at the calf and tapers down to the ankle. Shin armor can work on its own without any supporting garment because it has a part of your body to suspend itself on, namely your calves, where a strap will not slide down due to gravity thanks to the girth. But your thighs are basically cones - there's nothing to tie a strap around that won't eventually slump down.

Where medieval into early renaissance Europe is massively different from, say, feudal Japan, is that armor is almost exclusively worn attached to a purpose-built undergarment, usually a highly tailored jacket that girdles around the waist, with attachment points on it for armor. It is from this jacket that thigh, knee, and lower leg protection is suspended. It is only strapped to the leg to keep it from flopping around, but the straps aren't load bearing at all. 

This method of suspension largely doesn't exist in Japan, much less on hoplites. In Japan, armor was made to be worn over regular clothing, though not kimonos as much as lighter, less billowing robes and tunics. Because of this, there is no good way of suspending thigh armor on the leg itself - thus the prevalence of both tassets and haidate, a sort of Japanese equivalent of cuisses which are suspended from the hips via cloth and thongs.",True,False,0,1498960542,,False,0,djo39tm,t3_6kq0je,t1_djo2fl1,1499832939,47,False,armoredwomen,t5_2tli0,

,DruggedOutCommunist,,,"&gt;He strongly believed and talked about a great deal the need for violence and guns and such to take control of the state. Marx believed you needed rifles and bayonets and cannons to take control,

Again, as far as I know, Marx was not opposed to peaceful revolution, he just didn't think it likely. When talking about changing from one social order to another, he believed the transition would probably have to be violent simply because those in power would not easily give up what they have. 

This wasn't ""we need violence to establish communism"", it was ""any radical social change will probably have to be violent"". Even when talking about the history of Capitalism [in Capital](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch31.htm) he mentions that: ""If money, according to Augier, [14] “comes into the world with a congenital blood-stain on one cheek,” capital comes dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt. [15]""

And he wasn't exactly wrong on that point. Writing in the mid-nineteenth century he wouldn't have been too far removed from the French Revolution, Robespierre and Napoleon. 

&gt; and that by starting a revolution in Russia, as Marx had suggested,

What? This isn't true at all. Marx didn't desire or believe that a revolution would even be possible in Russia, he viewed the whole country as backwards not just socially, but also economically as it wasn't nearly as industrialised as Western Europe was. AFAIK the places where Marx desired and predicted a revolution were Britain, France, Germany and the USA.

No they were not, CrowdStrike wiped the server. And even without the raw data the report indicates the attack wasn't sophisticated. And Senators aren't computer security experts, they're not qualified to analyze the data. 

&gt; The Intelligence Community confirmed it. 

It's literally impossible for anyone but the CIA to confirm this, and then only if they had a high-level mole at the FSB that confirmed it. There's no way the CIA would burn that mole, so there's no way to get confirmation. And that's exactly what anonymous CIA sources claim:

&gt; In particular, the CIA had obtained intelligence from sources inside the Russian government

There is no fucking way the CIA gave up the identities of those sources to the Senate. And I should stress that it's just the WORD of those sources. There are no Russian documents because if they had docs, they definitely would have be scrubbed and leaked by now. So it's still just the CIA's word for it. Nobody should take the CIA's word for anything after the Iraq War. 

&gt; The hacking is a settled fact. 

No it's not. Kim Dotcom and other Wikileaks figures have said the emails came from Seth Rich. And the only public information, the CrowdStrike report, looks like amateur Russian-speaking hackers to me.

That's a lost cause. Notice how Congress grovels at the feet of AIPAC.

Trump isn't ""my guy"", he's an idiot.

&gt;the drug (LSD) breaks down the parts of the brain that usually separate different functions, like vision and movement, creating a more “integrated or unified brain”. They also found that people who are having drug-induced hallucinations “see” with various other parts of their brain, not just the visual cortex that is active in normal vision. ""Normally our brain consists of independent networks that perform separate specialised functions, such as vision, movement and hearing - as well as more complex things like attention"", “However, under LSD the separateness of these networks breaks down and instead you see a more integrated or unified brain."" ""Our results suggest that this effect underlies the profound altered state of consciousness that people often describe during an LSD experience.

&gt;""Our brains become more constrained and compartmentalised as we develop from infancy into adulthood, and we may become more focused and rigid in our thinking as we mature,” “In many ways, the brain in the LSD state resembles the state our brains were in when we were infants: free and unconstrained. This also makes sense when we consider the hyper-emotional and imaginative nature of an infant's mind."" According to results from the same study, which was published in the journal European Neuropsychopharmacology, those effects could be even further encouraged with the use of music. Listening to music while under the influence of the drug led the visual cortex to receive information from the part of the brain that usually deals with mental images and memory and the more it did so, the more people reported seeing complex visions including those from earlier in their lives.

&gt;Psilocybin, the main psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms, sprouts new links across previously disconnected brain regions, temporarily altering the brain's entire organizational framework. These new connections are likely what allow users to experience things like seeing sounds or hearing colors. And they could also be responsible for giving magic mushrooms some of their antidepressant qualities. Typically, brain activity follows specific neural networks. But in the people given psilocybin injections, cross-brain activity seemed more erratic, as if freed from its normal framework, the drug changed how information was carried across the brain. When the researchers looked more closely, however, they noticed that the sparks of activity across the brains of their drugged volunteers wasn't as chaotic as it seemed. Instead, the activity formed distinct patterns, or cycles.

&gt;These new connections allow parts of the brain that don't usually talk to one another to communicate. People who use magic mushrooms and see the number 52 as glowing bright blue and red, then, don't see it that way because the drugs have made them crazy. Instead, they associate the number with colors because the brain region that detects and interprets color has been chatting it up with the brain region that processes numbers. When regions of the brain that don't normally talk directly to one another cross signals, the result is a trip. In a 2012 study, Imperial College London neuroscientist David Nutt found that in people drugged with psilocybin, brain chatter across traditional areas of the brain was muted, including in a region thought to play a role in maintaining our sense of self. In depressed people, Nutt believes, the connections between brain circuits in this sense-of-self region are too strong. ""People who get into depressive thinking, their brains are overconnected,"" Nutt told Psychology Today. Negative thoughts and feelings of self-criticism become obsessive and overwhelming. Loosening those connections and creating new ones, Nutt thinks, could provide intense relief.

&gt;Psilocybin dramatically transformed the participants' brain organization, Expert said. With the drug, normally unconnected brain regions showed brain activity that was synchronized tightly in time. That suggested the drug was stimulating long-range connections the brain normally wouldn't make. After the drug wore off, brain activity went back to normal. Basically, psilocybin might be temporarily causing users' brains to enter a hyperconnected state, perhaps beginning to explain the strange, sometimes frightening but often enlightening experiences that typify a psychedelic trip. More concretely, it may also help explain why studies have found that psychedelic experiences administered in a calm, physician-assisted environment (essentially the old concept of drug, set and setting) can have striking psychological effects. Studies have shown magic mushrooms might be able to calm the ego and inspire optimism, quit smoking and even help people break free of troublesome personality traits. Patients with terminal diseases have even talked about how psilocybin helped them come to terms with their own mortality. With attitudes on drugs shifting quickly, the study of psychedelics really does seem to have endless possibilities.",True,False,1,1498963195,,False,0,djo4ya8,t3_6kqzdx,t3_6kqzdx,1499833747,3,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,

,HelpingHarm,,,"In popular fantasy for us, they are mostly based on Tolkien who copied them from the oral-historian shamans of Druidecht (Druidism), called Druids, or Drywwds. A great example of one, but suped up and ""pimped out"" would be Gandalf and Tom Bombadiil. 

Imagine a expert historian who can tell you a encyclopaedia from page to page, every detail, but all straight from his memory. Also a priest who engaged in rites and such. To the Druidecht, a wooden staff was very important and symbolic, a symbol of religious and righteous power. Thus, why the staff is always used like a powerful item.

The Druid followers made no disctinction between male and female druids. They never distinguished it. Like you know how
we have 'priest' and 'priestess', well they had no -ess. It's like our modern word 'pastor' there is
no difference. They may have also dressed exactly the same, and wore their hair the same (hair is free, uncut, hanging down your back. The only adorning is a leaf wreath used as a crown/hat. In more Gothic regions, a cap (usually a pointed top hat like a stocking cap) was often associated with mystical or spiritual power. Like how modern Christians may see a person/monster holding a thick brown book or tome. Pointed caps took even more prominence in the mountainous regions of Western to Caucasian Europe.).

-Bards &amp; Ovators,  
-O'vateis (diviners and specialists in the natural world),
-*dru-wid-s (Oak-Knower) (moral and life philosophers, ""gurus""),

-O'vateis:
Today, those who study as Ovates within Druidry learn to work with the powers of Nature ・they learn the Ogham and come to know the trees as living Beings with their own medicines and gifts. They work with the sacred animals of tradition, and with different methods of divination, and many begin a study of herbalism or other methods of healing, and in particular they learn how to encourage the flow of Nwyfre through the body. Nwyfre is the Druid term for Life-force, known as Chi・or Prana in the East. 

So, in fantasy, a wizard (wyzrrd) would be a Druid (Oak-Knower, think of a very high class spiritualist/faith healer with legit power). A sorceror would be more in line with a O'vateis, or just a priest of a foreign culture/religion. Like a Voodoo or Hindu ""shaman"" may be called a ""sorceror."" And a mage *could be* a very powerful shaman/mystic of a foreign culture/religion, someone who expertly wields and effects the ""clean"" forces of reality and the elements.

&gt; Greyboy is San Diego producer and DJ, Andreas Stevens, he makes spacy acid jazz with hip-hop roots.  Also variously known as DJ Greyboy and also contributed to the Greyboy Allstars.

&gt; ""Soul Mosaic"" is the latest Greyboy album, and was recorded 10 years after the release of ""Freestylin',"" the first Greyboy full-length album for Ubiquity. The tracks crafted into this fourth Greyboy album include groundbreaking territory for the Southern California based producer/DJ. For the first time he recorded full vocal songs adding a new soulful dimension to his music. The trademark laid-back West Coast Greyboy beats remain central to ""Soul Mosaic"" but are now enhanced by collaborations with folks like Sharon Jones, Bart Davenport (Honeycut), and Bing Ji Ling.

&gt; A decade ago ""Freestylin'"" became a surprise underground hit, it was a building block of the early acid jazz movement and still holds cult status today. Since then Greyboy has released the equally jazz-based instrumental ""Land of the Lost"" and the soundtrack and hip hop inspired ""Mastered The Art"", which featured musicians and MCs in a prelude to the ""Soul Mosaic"" album.

&gt; Greyboy has recorded with AG (Showbiz &amp; AG), and the Greyboy AllStars (whom he helped put together and produce). His music has been featured in movies like Get Shorty, Celtic Pride, The Kelly Slater Surf Pro video game, Budweiser commercials, and he was handpicked to provide a mix CD for DC shoes.

&gt; Over the years Greyboy has DJ'd in Japan, Europe, and across the USA. His largest DJ gig was to 5000 people in the countryside outside of Rome, but throughout the summer of 2003 he played to over 20, 000 people a night on tour with Ben Harper and Jack Johnson. His DJ philosophies have never changed, he practices to stay technically on top of his game but never practices a set for a specific night preferring to put together tunes and based on the vibe at each gig.

&gt; Working up the rough drafts for ""Soul Mosaic"" Greyboy recorded parts, solos, and lyrics with guests returning to the lab in his Long Beach home to deconstruct and sift through all the elements. And just like the aesthetic of Killingsworth, the well-known Case Study House architect who built the house which Greyboy recently restored (it was featured twice in Dwell Magazine), less is definitely more. In fact the process of restoring the home is not unlike his approach to making music. His mid-century modern building has been altered, remodeled and added onto over the years, Greyboy is currently putting it back the way it was supposed to be.

&gt; Vocalists like Bay Area underground favorite Bart Davenport sings on the two sold-out singles ""To Know You is To Love You"" and ""Genevieve"", cover versions of a Stevie Wonder tune (originally recorded by Syreeta) and Cymande respectively. ""Genevieve"" was nominated as one of the songs of the year by Radio 1's Worldwide host Gilles Peterson. East Coast based Sharon Jones has made a storming come back with Daptone Records over recent years and also appears on two tracks. San Francisco up n'comer Bing Ji Ling adds a lil' Shuggie Otis folksy soul and guitar while MCs like Mainflo (TVT), and musicians and turntablists like D-Styles and Ricci Rucker (Sound In Color) maintain the hip hop pressure, and Robert Walter and Karl Denson (of the Greyboy AllStars) add a touch of jazz. Rounding out the mosaic are co-producers like the UK-based Quantic and West Coaster Mike Andrews, who recently had a hand in the Christmas #1 spot on the UK charts with a version of Tears For Fears ""Mad World"" from the Donnie Darko soundtrack.

&gt; ""I couldn't have done this when I recorded Freestlyin', working with artists from all around the world is one of the beauties of modern technology"", says Greyboy

&gt; (2) San Diego producer and DJ Andreas Stevens, or Greyboy, was initially taken by hip-hop but -- because he couldn't find any decent MCs to hook up with -- shifted his attention to acid jazz. He was, in fact, the very first American producer to do so. And it was an inspired move. In 1994 Stevens served up his debut solo album, Freestylin', with the help of talented sax player Karl Denson. The offering became a cult hit, especially in acid jazz-hungry Europe. Released on the label Ubiquity, it cost $4,000 to make and nothing to market, yet it remains the label's most successful offering. That same year Stevens did his credentials no harm with the underground favorite track ""Unwind Your Mind"" (another collaboration with Denson), which appeared on Ubiquity's Home Cookin' compilation. His next album, Land of the Lost, came out in 1996, at a time when the popularity of acid jazz was beginning to wane. From 1993 to 1997 Stevens was, along with Denson, also a key figure in the acid jazz band Greyboy Allstars, who put out three albums on their own Greyboy Records label. Stevens then drifted back to his hip-hop roots, pairing up with skateboarding champ Rob Dyrdek to launch the record label P-Jays. Not surprisingly, the label's offerings -- including compilations and 12"" releases -- were most popular among skateboarders. Stevens made a return as Greyboy in 2001, with the critically acclaimed album Mastered the Art. A fusion of hip-hop, jazz, rare-groove, and even world music, it also boasted the talents of live musicians Dave Pike and Elgin Park and rapper MC MainFlo. ~ David Peter Wesolowski, Rovi Read more on Last.fm.

Chicken, frog, dog, cat, horse and pig’s bones are melted down, mixed with glue, resin and plaster, then used as base material for re-casting as “dinosaur bones.”  They are even given intentional fractures and an antiquated/fossilized look to achieve the right effect.

,admiralvic,,,"&gt; Could Nintendo have theoretically survived on it's handheld line?

Of course? They could survive if they had another Wii U situation too. 

&gt; could Nintendo had just stuck with the DS that generation and be just as, if not more successful? 

They would be much less successful. They might've been able to get the 3DS to sell better at launch, as it was viewed as a flop for a while,  but that's about it. 

&gt; how would their reputation differ from when they had home consoles?

Even though the DS/3DS lines did really well, a lot of truly amazing games released on the GameCube and later, resulting in a massive loss in potential influence for Nintendo. These include Super Smash Bros. Melee, Luigi's Mansion, Super Mario Sunshine, Metroid Prime 1/2/3, LoZ Wind Waker and later, Animal Crossing (in NA/EU anyway), Super Mario Galaxy 1/2, Wii Sports, Xenoblade Chronicles, Splatoon and many more. Not to mention all the hype/articles they got for motion controls. Without Nintendo bringing out the Wii, who knows if we would've seen the Move or a lot of motion based elements as soon as we did.

With all these changes, we might get scaled down games, but I don't think Nintendo would be as relevant as they're today. Especially with the potential loss of Splatoon and Animal Crossing. Heck, upgrading the DS/3DS might actually be their undoing, as it would make Sony's PSP far more compelling. 

&gt; just take the New 3DS and make that the base model 

When the 3DS, in its base non-XL form, first released, it was $250, just like the PS Vita that released later that year. If the 3DS had anything extra, it stands to reason Nintendo would've charged more and potentially created a situation where the Vita, even with memory cards, was less money. This, combined with, I believe, the PS Vita still having better specs than the New 3DS, would difficult. 

Even if the 3DS had all the great games it currently has and perhaps more, I could see the Vita potentially winning, as it has a number of pretty awesome titles and likely would've done better resulting in better support.

Artillery would hardly dent it, as very little of our projectiles could defeat the void shields.  Infantry would be deployed, and there would be some damage there to the Skitarii but likely not the Titan itself.

Once Standard Strategic assets (Air strikes, non-nuclear missile strikes, Infantry maneuvers) were exhausted, Special Ops would be tapped.  Odds are this would be months into whatever Destruction Spree the Titan was on, so most Military Forces would be disparate and working under a joint command of some kind.  There would be a lot of attempts to negotiate with the Titan, and I'm assuming they're not interested, so tactics would have to shift.  Depending on where it's located, Nuclear Assets would be used.  If it's moving from city to city, finding a place outside of 'range' of civilization isn't hard.  We've nuked huge swaths of the US with little -real- problems, so a thing marching globally would be a trifle to catch in the least populated area.

Assuming it ends up in Europe, the US would be a sort of safe haven.  Some weapons would be able to hit it beyond the horizon, but it can't risk a march through the ice caps or the oceans, so it would be bound to the continent it arrived on.

Of the million or so refugees they let in a year or two ago, something like 5% have jobs. The other 95% are getting welfare which is ridiculously generous in Germany and they're probably busy spitting out muslim babies too (which is the only thing muslims are good at, other than crime). The welfare bill is going to increase exponentially and they can't realistically increase taxes any more than they already have. Prisons are filling up with muslim immigrants too and each one costs tens of thousands per year.

Using the National Investment Bank to build zero carbon social housing will reduce housing costs for the poorest, putting money back in their pockets, it will reduce energy bills, putting money back in their pockets, the poorest will spend this money in the UK, increasing growth. Corbyn has also said local authorities should be able to borrow against housing capital to build new houses, a boost to the economy. 

Corporation tax will not be hiked for SMEs (it will stay as it is now) and for large companies it will go back to something like 2013 levels and still be lower than our competitor nations. The money will then be used on infrastructure, to help create a highly educated, healthy, population with good transport links that can get to jobs around the country, all these things are things companies need to thrive and reduce the cost of doing business in the UK. This tax system should help SMEs compete against the big boys, SMEs employ more people, and actually pay their taxes, so employment should go up and tax take should go up. Companies don't just care about corporation tax -  skills, health, and general quality of the country is important for doing business and attracting the best people to your company. Also a Brexit that maintains as much as possible from the EU will be a massive boost to businesses.  

Increasing employee power can make employees feel they have a greater stake in a business and a real voice, potentially meaning they are happier and more productive, plus some argue that the people closest to the coal face actually know what is going on with a business better than managers in ivory towers, so their input can help find inefficiencies and help the business. 

Many of your other points are not specifically related to the economy, they are related to making life better for people in the country or morality. These surely should also be a goal.

Take a look at his dribbled past numbers, fouls, blocks and interceptions. 

Hint: the numbers are one of the worst there. Not exactly amongst stellar company either.  

Edit: if you listened to the opinions on this sub, you would be shocked as to why we didn't win the league by at least 10 points last season. Best attack, best left back in Europe, best cb pairing when fit, solid rb and top gk. 

It's like listening to united fans saying Rashford is the best youngster in the world. Pogba and Herrera world class. Valencia best rb. De gea best gk.

The 29th ID, a tactical realism unit, was established in 2005 by Captain Timothy C. Wilson. In this unit we use a modified American World War Two rank structure, but in-game we operate in a modern way with modern-day tactics. We strive to achieve our victory by using tactics as real and modern as the game currently allows. In the 29th Infantry Division, we are looking for dedicated, mature soldiers willing to put time and effort in advancing their skills with weapons, teamwork, and tactics. Not only for themselves, but also for the unit. We train and fight in both TvT and COOP scenarios with focus on squad and platoon tactics and communications, while at the same time **offering both NA and EU-friendly times.**

As far as literacy among the English is concerned, 25-34 y/olds are actually in a different score bracket to 55-64 y/olds.

25-34 y/olds:

&gt;Texts at this level are often dense or lengthy, and include continuous, non-continuous, mixed, or multiple pages of text. Understanding text and rhetorical structures become more central to successfully completing tasks, especially navigating of complex digital texts. Tasks require the respondent to identify, interpret, or evaluate one or more pieces of information, and often require varying levels of inference. Many tasks require the respondent to construct meaning across larger chunks of text or perform multi-step operations in order to identify and formulate responses. Often tasks also demand that the respondent disregard irrelevant or inappropriate content to answer accurately. Competing information is often present, but it is not more prominent than the correct information.

55-64 y/olds average:

&gt;At this level the medium of texts may be digital or printed, and texts may comprise continuous, non-continuous, or mixed types. Tasks in this level require respondents to make matches between the text and information, and may require paraphrasing or low-level inferences. Some competing pieces of information may be present. 

Going back to OP's comment, 

&gt;talking to remain voters i've just been so surprised at how little they know about the eu institutions, but i guess that explains why they all voted remain...

TL;DR the most literate age group voted to remain, and while the least literate age group also voted to remain (18-24 y/olds), data suggests that 25-34 y/o remainers were able to make an informed decision, while 55-64 y/olds, with a lower literacy level that requires paraphrasing and low-level inferences, may not have been as well equipped as 25-34 y/olds.

Performance in the majors is HARDLY an indication of tier, they happen 6 months apart and used to have a shitty system. Titan were notorious for failing to get out of groups but consistently finished top 4 elsewhere. Astralis didn't even get to a grand final of a major until this year, yet they were #1 for long periods of time before that - on Thoorin's ranking, on HLTV's ranking, on anyone's ranking.

Remember that time when CLG and Liquid became legends? What, were they tier 1 at the time? No, of course not.

I added edits to ADD evidence and strengthen my point, but did not change any of the existing information. My first reply was about coL because that's literally who the players were playing for. They then transferred into C9 before the Cologne major.

I am hardly biased - your EU supremacist attitude is the biased one. 

I don't care much for what region your CS team comes from. My flair is FlipSid3 and they don't have a drop of NA blood between the 5 of them. Before that, my favorite team was VeryGames and then Titan - my all time favorite lineup was Maniac/RpK/Ex6TenZ/apEX/kennyS; I even got a job with them as a graphics designer. I thought iBuyPower were pretty good but hardly fanboyed them to the extent you are implying, and I give a very comprehensive, fair breakdown of the whole thing.

And where is this implication that I thought they were going to win the major? Wtf? I never said that ever? I never mentioned anything about unbanning so why do you think I believe that they will win after getting unbanned? For the record, I thought AZK was the best player on that team and he's not coming back, so I doubt they will even make top 5.

Also, why are you being such an asshole? I haven't insulted you once. And why specifically do you have something out for NA? Since when did the NA region as a whole have anything to do with this? Why are you making this political?

In Norse mythology, the einherjar (Old Norse ""single (or once) fighters"") are those who have died in battle and are brought to Valhalla by valkyries. In Valhalla, the einherjar eat their fill of the nightly-resurrecting beast Sæhrímnir, and are brought their fill of mead (from the udder of the goat Heiðrún) by valkyries. The einherjar prepare daily for the events of Ragnarök, when they will advance for an immense battle at the field of Vígríðr; the battle which the ""ein"" (here meaning single-time) refers to.

The einherjar are attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, the poem Hákonarmál (by the 10th century skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir) as collected in Heimskringla, and a stanza of an anonymous 10th century poem commemorating the death of Eric Bloodaxe known as Eiríksmál as compiled in Fagrskinna.

**Wild Hunt**

The Wild Hunt is a European folk myth involving a ghostly or supernatural group of huntsmen passing in wild pursuit. The hunters may be either elves or fairies or the dead, and the leader of the hunt is often a named figure associated with Woden (or other reflections of the same god, such as Alemannic Wuodan in Wuotis Heer (""Wuodan's Army"") of Central Switzerland, Swabia etc.), but may variously be a historical or legendary figure like Theodoric the Great, the Danish king Valdemar Atterdag, the Welsh psychopomp Gwyn ap Nudd, biblical figures such as Herod, Cain, Gabriel or the Devil, or an unidentified lost soul or spirit either male or female.

Seeing the Wild Hunt was thought to presage some catastrophe such as war or plague, or at best the death of the one who witnessed it. People encountering the Hunt might also be abducted to the underworld or the fairy kingdom.

Why did we not use our influence to try and reform that system, rather than go ""Fuck it"" and leave?

,nooneshsh,,,"&gt;And what says that foreign policy of Saudi will change if it becomes a constitutional monarchy? I know we are assuming here as at the end we don't really know what MBS and the new generation will be like as rulers, but if recent actions are any indication, Saudi foreign policy will continue to be aggressive. But For example in the event Saudi becomes a constitutional monarchy, foreign policy might not be one of the institutions Al-Saud allow people to have a say in. 

Sorry I meant if KSA were to become a democracy, the foreign policy would change, and not a constitutional monarchy. Of course nothing would change if it became a constitutional monarchy.

&gt;But I have to rectify my comments regarding the US. In Obama's years we saw a weaker US regarding their involvement in ME and dealing with Russian resurgence. Obama pulled US troops from Iraq, the relationship with Saudi suffered, their stance regarding Iran softened and if I'm not wrong even downsized their troop numbers in Europe and pulled their tank regiment out of Germany. But with Trump in office, their foreign policy shifted back in favour of Saudi as we saw with Trump's state visit there. So there was a change in foreign policy in the US after a new government was sworn in.  

In Obama's years, the only thing that happened is that they continued doing the same things albeit showing a different story to the public. Just take a look at what they did in Libya. They also supported KSA and Israel with the creation of ISIS. All war and destruction, just like Iraq and Afghanistan. Doesn't seem that different to me. Trump is just slightly more open about his political goals than Obama. Both are just about the same. As is Bush. Hiding their intentions isn't what is causing the US's downfall, it's their corruption.

,Satouros,MURICA,USA,"&gt; Africa is cobered in rainforests and grassland. These are highly fertile.

Have you tried starting a farm in an African jungle? Grasslands are only good for grazing animals. Africa lacks many domestic animals that are in Europe. 

Pigs, chickens, and horses. 

Lack of water to farm the dry soil and having to walk 15 miles to the nearest water source because you lack horses.

&gt;Why didn't they develop in isolation like northeast asians?

I don't know what you're referring to. The Jurchen tribes of Manchuria? The Siberian khanate tribes? Korea? Japan?

&gt;How come all their counties are still shit after the west sank billions into it.

After the west sank billions into doing what? Giving food and water will not help African nations. They need infrastructure which most of Africa lacks. The west took over vast swaths of land with various tribal peoples who spoke different languages and had different cultures from each other. They created artificial borders and sapped the resources and abused the people and never built infrastructure. They then abandon the African countries that they created with artificial borders. This creates infighting as all these tribes are left to compete for power over their nations and are highly divided.

The British are infamous for causing strife all around the world due to artificial borders. Take a look at Israel and Palestine, Pakistan and India. 

Also, modern-day African nations aren't as shit as you might think. Surprisingly, China is actually taking an interest in African nations and building infrastructure unlike the west.

,dandmcd,,,"&gt;I've met an expat guy with a local girlfriend, and all she is is the butt of our jokes due to her English. I don't even know why they're together, and I certainly don't to be with someone like that.

Love isn't just about how well you speak a language.  My gf doesn't speak hardly any English, and we've been together for years, and despite the difficulty of communicating in Chinese, we rarely, if ever have a miscommunication or fight, and I am happy to death to have her in my life.  I've had girls I dated back in the States who I could never get a long with, and constantly we had fights or could not be happy around each other.  Communication is more than just words, how you treat each other, and show your love or affection is just as important.  Don't ignore the local women just because you think they you won't be happy around them, I've met plenty of cool Chinese chicks that have their heads on straight, speak excellent English, not completely brainwashed by the CCP, and enjoy lots of different activities.

The best place to meet other expats is through a university with students studying Chinese.  Since studying a semester or two probably isn't an option, at least meeting some of the people at the university would allow you to get connections to a lot of different people.  Making friends with people there, and hanging out at the university bars is a door opener.  You could even try to roommate with some college expats, instead of living on your own.  Often my old roommmates had parties, and I'd meet a lot of foreigners from Asia and Europe. (I don't know your situation, just tossing ideas out).  You said you previously made friends with an international student who is leaving.  Have her introduce you to some people, or maybe invite her and her friends out for hot pot or sushi.

&gt;I looked at apps, and it's a waste of time. There are barely any expat girls on tinder, and now the app won't even log in.

There's not really any good apps I'm aware of.  I think most expats kinda do their own thing, most aren't looking for other foreigners to be with, so you have to work harder to find them.  We give Chinese a hard time when they go to the States and just hang-out in their little Chinese bubbles, most expats to China also don't want to be stuck in expat bars and Starbucks, they want to get out and enjoy the culture and make new Chinese friends.

Other opportunities would be visiting a church.  You don't have to pretend to be a religious zealot, you can admit to others there that you are just looking to meet people, and most people would be supportive.

&gt;sects were forced to live with the other sects and accept them

The main reason is secularization, the transformation of a society from close identification and affiliation with religious values and institutions toward nonreligious values and secular institutions. Process of secularization was gradual. The first and most important sub-process was gradual replacement of religion by science as the source of cognition and knowledge. It was accompanied by change of religion role in private life. [Secularization of public matters and state] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_state) was also gradual process and had different development in various states. Some European states formally have a ""state religion"" up to now; other states went trough periods of active state atheism. Peaceful relationships between Christian denominations are result of secularization of the society and secularization of states, spreading open atheism, persecution of religion and religious institutions. So emergence of non-religious forces and institutions created environment and induced need for mutual tolerance and collaboration of Christian denominations.    

Appendix:
The (Christian) religion ceased to be a serious and important source of conflicts (in Europe) because it ceased to play (at least direct) important role in international and internal politics, society and public matters. Religion was replaced by other ideologies and value systems, which become sources of conflicts and wars. It doesn't seem me to be the present situation of Islam.

&gt; As someone who studied economics this post is so uninformed it hurts my brain.

Doesn't give a reason.

&gt; Can I also remind you that from 1950-1964 the Tories ran the country.

Indeed. Want a cookie?  They had *completely* different policies.  Like, worlds apart.

&gt; Labour were in office significantly less during this successful time.

Which is a lie. Labour were in office 1945 to 1951 and 1964-1970. You're comparing 11 years to 14 years—hardly a ""significant"" difference, especially when Labour actually laid the entire post-war foundation.

  &gt; Labour dominated the 70's where we famously became the sick man of Europe

Another lie. Edward Heath was in government between 1970 and 1974.

&gt; Thatcher arrived in 1979 and by 1991 every section of society was better off.

This is just pure dogma. Unemployment stood at over 10%, crime was through the roof, public services were crumbling.

&gt; Unlike the 70's filled with rolling black outs due to strikes, bins not being collected due to strikes, an economy out of control, high unemployment 

Are you serious? Unemployment skyrocketed and peaked in the Thatcher years. The three-day week came during the Tory government (not that it matters, but apparently you like to play ""Which government was in charge?""). Bins not being collected is a problem *right now* due to the Tories slashing local government by 40%.

The couple met at the Slip Inn, a pub in Sydney when the prince was visiting Australia during the 2000 Summer Olympics. Their official engagement in 2003 and their marriage the following year was the subject of extensive attention from Australian and European news media, which portrayed the marriage as a modern ""fairytale"" romance between a prince and a commoner.

Among the competitive scene, even TPA wasn't really considered true underdogs. There's a vlog from a CLG member, back when they were playing in OGN, mentioning them as an extremely strong team that consistently took games off of the top Korean teams. They were unknown in the West who were just circlejerking TSM and their favorite teams, but in the competitive scene, they were pretty well known as a serious contender, not just among CLG but pretty much every Korean and Chinese team at the time. 

Also, many first gen Koreans *were* mechanical gods, at least relative to the competition. In fact, we still have leftover names and terms from those days, like ""Madlife hooks"", ""Captain Jack cleanses"", etc. Even Flame later established the term ""Flame horizon"", albeit a little after his S2 play. This is all detracting from the fact that Korean dominance has much more to do with macro and team play than individual mechanical prowesses, but I digress.

Obviously the domination wasn't to the point where it is now where non-Koreans look rather hopeless against them, but by S2 Koreans were still undisputed as the strongest region. There's a reason why CLG/CLG.Eu went to compete in Korea in S2.

We also examine the relevance of other determinants of expansions in credit to income and test whether the causal relationships are sensitive to different measures of credit. We find that top income shares significantly affect future credit to income of the private household sector. The test statistics reveal that the effect of top income shares is weaker for bank credit to the private non-financial sector. This is broadly consistent with the notion, that rising (top-end) personal inequality may lead to an increase in demand for credit by low and middle income households in order to maintain their relative standards of consumption. While results suggest no robust causality relationship from the Gini coefficient to credit, there is evidence for feedback effects from credit to the income distribution. Moreover, we find bidirectional causality relationships between economic activity and credit on the one hand and asset prices and credit on the other which may give rise to mutually reinforcing boom-bust cycles. The monetary policy stance does not seem to be a strong driver of the expansion in credit to income and financial deregulation affects the expansion in credit to income only at the individual country level.

Noroi: The Curse. Creepy Japanese found footage film about a paranormal investigator who goes missing while investigating an ancient Japanese demon. 

Afflicted. Another found footage film, about two guys who travel through Europe and one of them winds up falling ill with a bizarre sickness. Really well done film.

As Above, So Below. Pretty cool found footage film about a team of explorers who embark on a journey through the catacombs beneath Paris in search of the philosopher's stone and wind up encountering... well, I won't spoil it for you.

The Atticus Institute. Another found footage film (I know, I know), but this is a great film. A group of paranormal investigators who run a lab encounter a woman with highly unusual gifts.  This film goes in really unique directions and winds up being genuinely really creepy.

The Orphanage. Spanish horror film about a woman who purchases the orphanage she grew up in. Eerie, beautifully shot, and very moving.

Dark Water. Japanese horror film about a recently divorced woman who moves into a creepy apartment with her little girl. Very atmospheric and creepy.

Inside. French home invasion horror film about a pregnant woman being terrorized by a psychopath. The gore is intense.

I Saw The Devil. Korean psychological horror/thriller. Really quite intense, very violent, fantastically well done.

Martyrs. French-Canadian extreme horror about a woman who takes revenge on the people who kidnapped and tortured her as a child, and what becomes of her friend who had witnessed her hallucinations. It's a film in two acts, and it's quite existential; it's difficult to give an accurate synopsis of the film, as it's a film that needs to be experienced rather than told. Extremely disturbing movie.

&gt;the UN weighed in on a dispute between Britain and Mauritius over the Chagos islands

This is where Diego Garcia is, and Britain forced the inhabitants to leave to make way for a military base.  Mauritius claims the islands and wants an international court to rule on the matter.

&gt;Ninety-four countries sided with Mauritius; just 15 backed Britain.

&gt;Only four members of the EU voted with Britain; one, Cyprus, voted with Mauritius and 22 abstained, including usually reliable allies France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.

&gt;Britain argued that it should be resolved bilaterally. America took its side. But with its State Department understaffed and its president widely distrusted, its lobbying effort failed.

Seems like our alliance with the US failed because they didn't care enough to make a serious effort, and because Trump is so widely loathed across the World.

&gt;Britain’s diplomacy was no better; the name of Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, “raised an eyebrow or a laugh each time it was mentioned”

&gt;In an inauspicious sign for “Empire 2.0”, the nickname British officials use for their plan to forge closer links with the Commonwealth, the vast majority of Britain’s former colonies backed Mauritius or abstained.

This is most concerning for me.  One of the arguments for Brexit is that we can rely on our Commonwealth more than the EU.  Unfortunately it doesn't seem that they view us in the same way.

&gt;Other far-flung British territories, such as the Falkland islands, might face new challenges from rival claimants. “If you’re an Argentinian diplomat, you may start recomputing how much international support Britain has,” says Mr Whitman.

&gt;The ICJ will probably offer an advisory opinion on the matter, but not before the spring of 2019. By then Britain is due to have left the EU. And Mauritius may even have a more sympathetic negotiating partner. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s leader, is—perhaps inevitably—a longtime advocate for the rights of the Chagossians.

This is not a serious matter - there is nothing binding on the UK.  But still it is a bad sign for our post-Brexit place in the World.

,Kesuke,,,"Before anyone gets carried away, this is further evidence that banks are basically looking to brass-plate their EU operations. This is where a company opens up a small office in an EU country with a skeleton staff, with the objective of nominally having residence in that country for legal purposes. The name brass-plating is a reference to the brass name plates you see on the outside of office buildings. Basically these ""relocations"" are relocating in name only (i.e.  Chucking a name plate on an office block in Dublin). The banks are looking to retain as much of their actual day to day business operations in London as possible. The reasons for this are that London has the infrastructure, the skill mix and the allied industries to actually perform the role of trade hub. It isn't just a case of moving a few thousand jobs to Frankfurt and 'voila' you're the new London.

As another poster has pointed out, the fact that different companies are brass plating in different nations also throws a nice big bucket of cold water over any French aspirations to 'poach' London's status as the financial hub for Europe. Like it or lump it, the EUs finances are still going to be piped through London. It's worth remembering that London's status as a major financial centre has been cultivated over 2000 years of Roman, Saxon, Norman and Imperial history. You can't just magic that somewhere else and if you could, everyone would be doing it because London is enormously profitable.

&gt; Manowar is a metal band from Auburn, New York, United States that prominently features mythology and fantasy in their lyrics as well as songs about Heavy Metal and a theme of camaraderie with rebellious attitude.

&gt; Manowar was founded by bassist Joey DeMaio and guitarist  Ross ""Ross the Boss"" Friedman in 1980. Joey DeMaio was a bass/pyro technician for Black Sabbath, who were playing a show in England at the time, and Ross the Boss was the guitarist of a band called Shakin' Street. The whole thing started when the two locked themselves in a locker room to find out which one could play the guitar harder and faster.

&gt; After agreeing that they would found a band, the two took in Eric Adams, the ""man with lungs of leather"", as their vocalist, and Donny Hamzik as their drummer. They released their first album, ""Battle Hymns"", with this lineup in 1982. On their second release, ""Into Glory Ride"" (1983), Scott Columbus was introduced as their new drummer, along with his custom made stainless steel drums (regular ones would not endure his aggressive style).  The contract for Into Glory Ride was also signed in the band's own blood. 

&gt; Manowar's third album, Hail to England (1984), started a tour in Great Britain. However, the band were fed up with their current record company's dominant nature, and released yet another record during the same year; ""Sign of the Hammer"" was published by 10 Records - hence the song ""All Men Play on 10"" included on this album.

&gt; In the beginning of 1987, ""Fighting the World"" was released, featuring hit songs such as ""Fighting the World"", ""Black Wind, Fire and Steel"" and ""Defender"". Followed by a tour in Europe, ""Fighting the World"" was a success.

&gt; Their next album, ""Kings of Metal"" (1988), was widely dedicated to the fans of Manowar all around the world, as can be told by looking at the cover (plenty of different flags scattered around). This album also featured recordings with a large male choir, such as ""Blood of the Kings"" and ""The Crown and the Ring (Lament of the Kings)"". The title of this album is the reason that their fans (and also themselves) dub them ""The Kings of Metal"".

&gt; Not being pleased by his career with Manowar, Ross the Boss quit the band at this point, and was replaced by David Shankle. Also, the drummer known as ""Rhino"" took Scott Columbus's place on Manowar's next release, ""The Triumph of Steel"" published in 1992. After finishing their ""Secrets of Steel"" tour, they were voted as the band that fans would most like to see in Russia, beating out Beatles and Michael Jackson.

&gt; 1996 saw the release of ""Louder than Hell"", with Scott Columbus back in the drums and a new talent, Karl Logan, in lead guitar. This album included hit tracks ""Gods Made Heavy Metal"", ""The Power"", ""Brothers of Metal (Pt.1)"" and ""Return of the Warlord"".

&gt; After some more touring and the change of millennium, ""Warriors of the World"" was released in 2002, featuring tracks ""Warriors of the World (United)"" and one dedicated to Italian fans, ""Nessun Dorma"", which was earlier performed by Eric Adams on their show in Italy.

&gt; Manowar has also released six live-DVD's, ""Hell on Earth"" Parts I-V and ""The Day the Earth Shook - The Absolute Power"", with the unbelivable event of the 2005 Earthshaker festival.  A new EP called ""Sons of Odin"" was released in October 2006.  Their latest album was released at the end of February - beginning of March 2007, entitled ""Gods Of War"".

&gt; Also in 2007 Manowar started their own metalfest in Bad Arolsen, Germany, which is called the Magic Circle Festival.

&gt; In August 2008 Manowar released an one-song single,  'Die With Honor'. The song was also edited for the latest ""Thunder in the sky"" EP, part of ""The Asgard Saga"" forthcoming CD. The EP included the song ""Father"" recorded in 15 more languages other than English-another tribute of the band to their faithful fans all around the world!

 as during my recent trip to China in a spa in the Oriental Mandarin Hotel. I have regular hip issues, so underwear really gets in the way of a proper treatment, yet I was also concerned for the MT's comfort level, being in a different country. So I told her my comfort level with not wearing underwear and asked her if she was ok with that. Ok with her, I'm pretty sure she preferred it. I am sure she has to deal with different cultures, different comfort levels, so she is ready for anything. 
I have three MTs - one is an MT/Naturopath based in Chinese medicine, has a studio in her home - I wear leggings and camisole, staying clothed the whole way through the massage, which is not a relaxation massage, she works specific problem areas like my hips and back. Another MT gives Swedish/Relaxation massage, I am fully undressed, and with so many European clientele that she has (who are known for being less concerned about draping), she give me the option of draping or not-draping the breast while on my back - I chose not because I have a high comfort level with her and the towel gets to be annoying. My other MT gives Lomi Lomi, low level of draping  - I can't imagine having to work around underwear in that massage. Just giving you an idea of how different MTs work can work in different ways.  And very often your comfort level with that MT determines how you feel about factors like underwear.
You won't be seen as looking for something sexual if you go without underwear. For the MT, you will likely be seen as someone who is less tense about receiving massage. Remember, you will get a better massage if you are relaxed so do what makes you feel the most relaxed. If you are more relaxed right now keeping the underwear, then do that. It's your massage.

,Wenno,phoenix,,"I'm aware of the fact that no marketing is being done until the game is out of Beta, which is probably a good idea so they can focus on production (Even though it's probably different teams that handle those different aspects.).

While that graph shows you constant players, it doesn't show you how many of those players keep on playing after they've played for a week. The game doesn't so much need to worry about people trying the game, since it's a Free-To-Play, it needs to have a way to keep people involved. The graph doesn't show that. If it wasn't an issue, then we wouldn't see 80/90% of casual servers containing people of a max level of 15, you know? People get bored at that point. I know I did and only when I came back and began to enjoy the gameplay did I stick around.

I'll answer these in corresponding bullet points.

* All FPS games require skill and since the game is a F2P game, it brings a lot of people into the gaming scene that haven't been in it before, which will probably make the game hard. Hell, some people might not of even played an FPS game before. But, we're the ones who have to deal wiith the idiots who don't even take the time to play the tutorial. Even stupider, SD had it remade and still didn't make it mandatory. Just wasting their money.

* Yes, that point is fair and I agree with it. I'm glad they're stepping up their production line after it took... 2 Years? After Dome's release for an objective map. Let's just hope the quality is on par with the rest.

* This also does need clarifying. It's brought up in like every Dirty Bomb video, in the community complaints part. (Talking about the official DB videos.) Along with this, I wish they'd clear up the message for scrubs when people try and stack repair/defuse which they did say they'd address in the next update. This ties in to the next question a bit too.

* There *is* saltiness from us, for fairly obvious reasons. When I'm playing ranked, I expect competence, which isn't even guaranteed when I'm queuing these days. If this was a game based on purely killing, I wouldn't mind, but people need to be taught that this is an objective game and they need to learn, before playing ranked, how to play the objective. Like, instead of our Bushwhacker flanking them to place a completely ineffective turret, to repair the EV. Stupid shit like this boils my piss. I expect to be put with people on my level, against people on my level. Instead, it seems like the Bronze/Low Silver ranks are completely obsolete. The reason I get so ratty when I come across a scrub in my ranked game is because they shouldn't be getting matched with a Silver Master, you know? They should be put in Bronze when they don't have a rank from the last season. Of course it's going to annoy me when a person, who is affecting my rank, doesn't know the difference from an engineer and a medic. It's ourageous.

That's an issue that will be solved as the game gets a bigger playerbase, so it might never be solved. If you're talking about ping and stuff. As the game grows, more and more servers will be available, I'm sure of it. That won't just be fixed with servers in more locations as the servers wouldn't be uesd. There's just not enough players to put them to use. I'm in the EU and I'm forced to play on US servers if I decide to play early in the morning.

In the final 8 or so games you've usually got 1 or 2 teams actually relegated already, 2 sides, 3 in a good season actually still with a shot at the title, 2-3 sides with a shot at 4th and 1-2 sides who could sneak into europe.

Half the table has given up, they have fuck all to play for, look at West Brom's form, or Palace last year when they were done half way through the season, Swansea a few years back won a cup then forgot how to play football. 

THere is a reason certain teams who still have something to play for suddenly 'play well' in the last 5-8 games, because by and large they are playing opposition who don't give a shit anymore.

Ox is crap defensively, I can't even count the number of times from a central position that he's stopped and watch an attack developing, let people run past him and reacted to the threat far too late, Arsenal as a whole seem to suffer from inability to track runners into the box from midfield. Offensively, he has a handful of useful games a year, the rest he shoots, often from outside the box, and has a horrible shots/goals ratio to the point that he should simply never shoot. 

Every year Arsenal do better in this period that almost everyone else has given up and every year people suddenly think oh, some players finally came good and Arsenal are on a run, we can carry that into next year. Every year those players go back to their usual form and Arsenal go back to being Arsenal for the start of the next season.

Last season 2 goals in 28 shots, 3 assists against Utd, 2 end of season in a game after Mourinho had completely abandoned the league. His other 4 assists in the league, one each in both West Ham games, Sunderland and Stoke.

,abb91,middleeast,Late Modern Middle East and the Balkans,"Hi again,

The newly formed governments had the agenda of making a more homogeneous society, and they did that in lot of different ways. First of all expulsion policies were widely used, especially in towns were Muslim communities was a minority, the state or neighbors would simply claim homes, land and belongings. Systematic cleansing or genocide were carried out by the armies and state supported militias. Various sources indicate that the Greek and the Bulgarian armies took largely part in raiding, killing and looting civilian populace. These types of atrocities were not only isolated instances in the Balkan Wars, also under previous wars and later in the Turkish War of Independence nationalistic influenced prosecution of minorities were commonly found.[1]

”On a close view of what happened in Macedonia, as the Balkan armies marched, this War of Liberation assumes a more sordid and familiar aspect.  It made the oppressed Christians for several months the masters and judges of their Moslem overlords. It gave the opportunity of vengeance … against a harsh landlord or a brutal neighbor” 

And

”The burning of villages and the exodus of the defeated population is a normal and traditional incident of all Balkan wars and insurrections. It is the habit of all these peoples.”

Carnegie Endowment, The other Balkan wars. Pages 71 and 73


Commonly the atrocities were carried out by militias, whom had been organised in the areas as robbers and guerrilla fighters. These actions were widely accepted and encouraged not only by the newly formed Balkan states, but also in the rest of the western world. The common view on atrocities and the wars at time was that these states were fighting against invaders, and the expulsion of Muslims were a rightfully engaged activity. This approach actually made it extremely difficult to find sources and reports that looked objectively on this issue, because these atrocities and prosecution is clearly and without any doubt classified as a genocide. The only thing that holds this separated from other genocidal atrocities in this time is that the victims were Muslims or Turks, and commonly these groups were classified as invaders, overlords and newcomers, but in reality they had lived side by with their Christian neighbors for centuries.[2]

”The expulsion of the Turks from Europe was long ago written in the book of  fate. There was nothing uncertain about it except the date and the agency of destiny”
Schurman,The Balkan Wars. Page 22

Back then these newly founded states were driven by nationalistic nostalgia and vision of creating a future, were these countries could rise again and become what they've been before the arrival of the Ottomans. And the atrocities were commonly justified with these nationalistic arguments, as a result these wars destroyed the multicultural composition of many areas and at the same time wounded relations between Muslim and Christian communities in generations  to come. The states were newly formed and not highly organised, so if they had any intention to stop the atrocities it would not have been effective. But I have not come upon anything that indicates a action against the atrocities.

When all this s said it is very important to pin point that these conclusions are based upon how the  newly formed Balkan nations treated the Muslim populace. If we dive in to atrocities of the Ottoman Army and their treatment of others we can find a similar patterns again driven by nationalistic ideals. Just to clarify I'am completely aware of that the Ottoman armies were no angels themselves, and the atrocities they carried out are widely researched and easily accessible in common history.

***
&gt;• Since 2002, hundreds of thousands of people around the world have logged onto a website run by Harvard University called Project Implicit and taken an “implicit association test” (IAT), a rapid-response task which measures how easily you can pair items from different categories.

&gt;• To create this new map, we used data from a version of the test which presents white or black faces and positive or negative words.

&gt;• But they are quicker to make the link between blackness and negative concepts in the Czech Republic or Lithuania than they are in Slovenia, the UK or Ireland.

&gt;• Looked at like this, the IAT – which at best is a weak measure of individual psychology – may be most useful if individuals’ scores are aggregated to provide a reflection on the collective social world we inhabit.

Ook het onderscheid tussen westerse en niet-westerse allochtoon is heel vaag en slecht gedefinieerd en de facto racistisch.

Is het niet omdat het een Nederlandse (en dus westerse) kolonie was? Dit betekend dat de infrastructuur en levensstandaard over het gemiddelde genomen een stuk hoger ligt dan in niet westerse landen. Dit zorgt er dan ook voor dat mensen gemiddeld hoger opgeleid zijn. Dat lijkt me een logischere aanname dan puur baseren op opleiding (wat overigens helemaal niets met racisme te maken heeft).

Wat betreft de verdere discussie: Voor mij zou een probleem liggen in de noodzaak onderscheid te maken. Ik zie dit als een mechanisme wat verdere polarisering in de samenleving bewerkstelligt. Een groot deel van het probleem zit in de opvatting van een bepaald woord. Het klopt dat na verloop van tijd mensen negatieve connotaties ontwikkelen bij bepaalde terminologie, echter dit is een probleem van de mensen; niet van de terminologie.

Het voorbeeld wat je aanhaalt met 'Niggers' is een goede.
Daarin kun je stellen dat zowel amerikanen met een europese als een afrikaanse achtergrond het woord op een racistische en niet-racistische manier gebruiken (denk aan rappers, acteurs etc).
Dit maakt het interpreteren van intenties behoorlijk lastig. Ik denk dat dit tot op zekere hoogte ook gebeurt met het woord allochtoon.

However, if you can take the damage, it might be in you best interest to attack at disadvantage as the Octopus can't use its tentacles on someone else until the grapple ends.

&gt; America is a soft rock band, most popular in the early and mid 1970s and now best known for their #1 hits ""A Horse With No Name"" and ""Sister Golden Hair."" Comprised of Gerry Beckley (September 12, 1952 - ), Dewey Bunnell (January 19,1952 - ), and Dan Peek (November 1, 1950 - July 24, 2011), they were seldom a favorite with critics, but were exceptionally successful commercially selling both singles and albums. Despite the presence of other heavyweight acts like James Taylor and Rod Stewart on their roster, America was Warner Brothers Records' biggest selling act of the 1970s.

&gt; Sons of American fathers and British mothers, their fathers being military personnel stationed at the West Ruislip USAF base in London, all three attended London Central High in Bushey, Hertfordshire in the mid-60s where they met while playing in two different bands.

&gt; They eventually got together and formed the rock band America, honoring the name of the homeland they had hardly even seen during their several travels around the world. They played their first gigs in pubs and clubs in the London area, including some highlights at the Roundhouse, where Pink Floyd had been playing at the beginning of their own career.

&gt; Their first LP was recorded at Trident and Morgan studios in London and produced by Ian ""Sammy"" Samwell, who was known for the hits he had written for Cliff Richard, with the assistance of Jeff Dexter.

&gt; The album was initially released in Europe with only moderate success and without the breakout hit ""A Horse With No Name."" Samwell helped the group to record and persuaded the Warner Brothers label to release the new song on an EP which was highly popular in the United States as well as in Europe.

&gt; America the album was re-released with ""Horse"", and quickly went platinum with the other favorites ""I Need You,"" ""Sandman,"" and ""Riverside."" Their second album, appropriately named Homecoming, saw the band moving back to the United States to record. The most notable song was ""Ventura Highway.""

&gt; The group's fourth album Holiday had them with George Martin (former producer for The Beatles), who worked with them through Silent Letter in 1979 with much success. The next album, Hearts, featured ""Sister Golden Hair"" and ""Daisy Jane.""

&gt; Peek left the group after recording Harbor in 1977. The remaining duo produced many more albums and had one more significant radio hit, ""You Can Do Magic,"" reaching #8 on the pop charts in 1982. Their last top-40 hit was ""The Border,"" which went to #33 on the pop charts (and #4 on the adult contemporary charts) the next year.

&gt; America continued with consistent live work and sporadic recordings following their departure from Capitol Records in the mid-80s.

&gt; In 1982 America provided the soundtrack for the magical anime film The Last Unicorn. Although officially produced by an American company, the film is an important transitional work in the development of Japanese anime, since most of its animation was subcontracted to the Japanese company Topcraft. The music was composed by Jimmy Webb, though performed by America, and the title song was covered many times later on. The tone is wistful and the themes are of loss.

&gt; Beckley released a solo set - ""Van Go Gan"" - in 1999.

&gt; Later, in his post-America career, Peek became a born-again Christian and released some highly-successful Contemporary Christian albums. His autobiography ""An American Band"" chronicles America's most successful period and his own spiritual journey.

&gt; Members include: 
Gerry Beckley (1970-present) - lead and backing vocals, keyboards, guitars, bass, harmonica
Dewey Bunnell (1970-present) - lead and backing vocals, guitars
Dan Peek (1970-1977) - lead and backing vocals, guitars, bass, keyboards, harmonica

,bbrown3979,,3/24 CSP CSR MPE CIP- Referrals in profile page,"I would definitely recommend doing the CIP next as the other poster mentioned. Start your business relationship with Chase early. If you can locate a BRM in branch you can apply for 100k offer vs 80k online and through standard bankers. The CSR (450 AF -300 travel credit =150) would also net you an extra 50k points and lounge access through priority pass. With all of the travel plans you will definitely get use out of this. The extra 50% bonus on UR helps as well.
I know you mentioned interest in Companion pass, which living in the ATL hub is great for USA (and parts of central America: ex Costa Rica, Mexico, Belize), but it will only help on a handful of flights for your big picture. As far as Europe there are some great redemptions with British Airways as their reward chart is distance based, but that Chase card is not under 5/24 so it's not a priority. If you do want the SW Companion pass it lasts for the rest of the current year and all of the following year.

By joining countries with strong economies based in technology like Germany, UK, Finland, etc... to countries like Portugal or the Eastern block that are based on cheap labour, the economies based on cheap labour begin to have a harder time competing with other countries as the Euro raises the costs and salaries of the country thus making it less competitive. Granted that the EU distributes plenty of money to raise the standards of the countries, but corruption and stupid politicians squander the money with little to show for. You can see this between Ireland and Portugal... in the 80's we had similar economies and joined the EU roughly at the same time. They invested heavily in technology and advanced skills for their people, Portugal built roads. Eventually the money ran dry and Portugal saw all their industry move out where it was cheaper... but still had much better roads than Ireland. Just nothing to fill them with. 

There are great things and not so great things about it though. The one you pointed out is a not so great, but to a certain extent the result of joining different economies. 

Most foreigners want to come to the UK as the benefits system works for anyone that just landed off a boat. Any other country, you usually have to work before you're allowed any kind of benefits and even then you won't make a nice living. However, as I see it, for a politician to change this is committing political suicide so they let it slide when people unjustly say that it's because of EU law that this happens. 
Sadly, anyone with half a brain would see through it as these people are crossing 4 or 5 EU countries with much better weather and proximity to home and if the benefits system was determined by the EU it would make more sense to stay down south.

&gt; Peter Gene Hernandez (born October 8, 1985 in Waikiki, Hawaii), better known by his stage name Bruno Mars, is a Filipino-Puerto Rican American singer-songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist signed to Atlantic Records. He is most well known for his hit Just The Way You Are, which went #1 in 9 countries in 2010. He is also known for singing/co-writing the hooks for the #1 hit Nothin' On You by B.o.B, and Billionaire by Travie McCoy; he also co-wrote the international hits Right Round by Flo Rida and Wavin' Flag by K'naan.

&gt; After the success of the songs he featured on, Mars released his debut EP, It’s Better If You Don’t Understand, in May 2010. 

&gt; He then released his debut album, Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans, on October 5th, which features special guest appearances from B.o.B, Cee-Lo Green, and Damian Marley.  The lead single, Just the Way You Are, was released on July 19, 2010.  The second single off the album, Grenade, was released on September 2010 as a promotional single but was eventually shifted to official second single. The It Will Rain Songfacts reports that in 2011 he recorded ""It Will Rain,"" the lead single from the soundtrack to the movie The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1. It was released exclusively on iTunes September 27, 2011.

&gt; Bruno Mars was born and raised in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii by parents Pete and Bernadette ""Bernie"" Hernandez, of Puerto Rican and Filipino descent. Hernandez was one of six children and came from a musical family giving him a diverse mix of reggae, rock, hip hop, and R&amp;B. From a young age, he was impersonating and performing songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, The Isley Brothers, and The Temptations. In 1990, Hernandez was featured in MidWeek as ""Little Elvis"", going on to have a cameo in Honeymoon in Vegas in 1992. ""I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love studying them because I'm a fan,"" he stated.

&gt; In 2010 he said, ""Growing up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father's band. Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays instruments. My uncle's an incredible guitar player, my dad's an incredible percussionist, my brother's a great drummer, he actually plays in our band. I've just been surrounded by it."" He attended President Theodore Roosevelt High School, graduating in 2003 at the age of seventeen, and shortly after moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a musical career.

&gt; Before becoming a successful solo artist, Hernandez was an acknowledged music producer, writing songs for Alexandra Burke, Travie McCoy, Adam Levine, Brandy, and Sean Kingston, as well as Flo Rida's international hit ""Right Round"". He also co-wrote the Sugababes' hit song ""Get Sexy"" and provided backing vocals on their album Sweet 7. His first musical appearance as a singer was in Far East Movement's second studio album Animal, featured on the track ""3D"". He reached prominence as a solo artist after being featured on and co-writing B.o.B's ""Nothin' on You"" and Travie McCoy's ""Billionaire""; both songs peaked within the top ten of many charts worldwide. He said of them, ""I think those songs weren't meant to be full-sung songs. If I'd sung all of ""Nothin' on You"", it might've sounded like some '90s R&amp;B."" Following this success, Mars released his debut extended play (EP), titled It's Better If You Don't Understand, on May 11, 2010. The EP peaked at the ninety-ninth position on the Billboard 200 and produced one single: ""The Other Side"", featuring rappers Cee Lo Green and B.o.B. He performed a medley of ""Nothin' on You"" and ""Airplanes"" with B.o.B and Hayley Williams at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.

&gt; He opened for Maroon 5 on the fall leg of the Hands All Over Tour which began on October 6, 2010. Mars also co-headlined with Travie McCoy on a European tour that started on October 18, 2010.

&gt; On September 19, 2010, Mars was arrested in Las Vegas for possession of cocaine. He claims ""he has never used drugs before"" and his decision was ""foolish"".

&gt; He has been nominated for seven 2011 Grammy Awards. Read more on Last.fm.

,guildensterncrantz,CROA,Croatia,"Spicy Ex-Yu slapfight that *doesn't* involve Serbia, which made the Serb redditors feel very strange indeed.

It's the endless border dispute with Slovenia. Recap:

+ Jugoslavia never settled its internal borders properly, especially not the maritime borders.

+ So Croatia and Slovenia have been arguing since independence. Slovenia cares because they want access to international waters, which the usual divisions of sea-borders wouldn't give them (it usually goes half-half for various bays and seas, Bay of Piran in this case). Croatia cares *because of the principle*. Translation: because we have other uncertain borders with Ex-Yugos, don't want bad precedent.

+ Bunch of agreements in 90's and 00's fell through. So Slovenia blocked our access to EU because *we're not friends anymore ;-;*. (See: the other reason we care about the *principle*.) Then we agreed to the arbitration because we're both too petty to resolve the issue on our own, and so they unblocked us.

+ Then in 2015 Slovenia was caught trying to influence the judges. To the surprise of no-one, Croatia jumped on that opportunity to withdraw from the process, some Vienna convention of withdrawal or whatever. Parliament voted unanimously that the arbitration doesn't exist for us anymore.

+ Slovenia don't care about that. The court investigated itself and concluded that the court is clean.

+ This Thursday the verdict was given. It's not actually bad because both sides are mildly instead of strongly displeased. Problem is that Croatia is like ""what, that non-existent arbitration?"", because *principle*. Same *principle* means Slovenia won't hear of trying to settle it bilaterally.

+ And now, what do?

https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/world/europe/germany-gay-marriage.html

&gt; The historic decision came with a swiftness rare in Germany’s usually staid politics, just five days after Chancellor Angela Merkel unexpectedly relaxed her party’s opposition to same-sex marriage and allowed lawmakers to vote on the issue according to their consciences.

&gt; Ms. Merkel’s softened resistance opened the way for her coalition partners in the Social Democratic Party and two other political groups to press for a vote on the measure, which had previously been blocked by her Christian Democrats and their conservative allies. Ms. Merkel voted against the measure on Friday, but many of her party colleagues voted in favor, allowing it to pass easily — 393 votes in favor and 226 against, with four abstentions.

&gt; “If the Constitution guarantees one thing, it is that anyone in this country can live as they wish,” Thomas Oppermann, the parliamentary leader of the Social Democrats, said in opening the floor debate. “If gay marriage is decided, then many will receive something, but nobody will have something taken away.”

&gt; His remark was clearly intended to defuse the opposition of conservatives like Ms. Merkel who argued that the Constitution protected conventional marriage.

&gt; Explaining her stance after the vote, Ms. Merkel said that while she had come to support the right of same-sex couples to adopt, she continued to believe that marriage ought to remain a union between a man and a woman. What she did not want, she said, was a culture war over the issue.

&gt; “I hope that with today’s vote, not only that mutual respect is there between the individual positions, but also that an amount of social peace and togetherness can be created,” Ms. Merkel said.

&gt; Axel Hochrein, a board member of the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany who attended the parliamentary debate, said of Ms. Merkel’s vote: “This is perhaps part of her religious education. I think it is more honest of her than to say yes. In the end, she fought for a long time against it, and always argued it was in her feelings, and this was a feelings decision.”

,IAmNotRyan,undecided,Undecided,"I will give you that the word ""extreme"" is a bit much, but in terms of US presidents, he is very far to the right. The problem with Trump is that he doesn't hold a lot of solid positions, so it's hard to pin him down until he actually does something. A good example is how, a lot of people probably thought he'd be pro-marijuana because he hadn't really spoken out against it, but he wound up putting Jeff Sessions in as AG, which is essentially the biggest codemning action he could possibly take. So, sure he's not, like, African-dictator-extreme-right, but the positions he supports through his actions show him as the most right-wing president in history. 

His healthcare position was kind of ambiguous until he supported the GOP house bill, which is kind of brutal towards people who can't get insurance through their work. I'd say it's a very far right-wong position.

As for gay rights, he seems to not care too much either way, in that, he's ok with gay people succeeding in society, but he won't really actively help them. It'pretty much the exact same position as Obama. And, at this point, I'd say gay rights are almost a minor issue in comparison of others.

Trump is extreme right when it comes to education though. His support of Betsy Devos, shows he'd prefer a system that defunds public schools in favor of private and charter schools. 

Trump is also extreme right when it comes to climate change. Most GOP members claim climate change is happening, but not man-made. Trump claims climate change is entirely nonsense.

Finally I'll just say this. I do consider myself center-left. Almost completely center actually. I believe in a strong free market, and I believe a low-tax burden is good for everyone. I'd hobestly prefer America to be closer to what it is right now, than for it to look like a European country.

I didn't invade anyone's land. I have nothing to feel guilt nor shame over. I'm assuming you're not a Native, since you keep using ""they"" and ""them,"" so I'm not 100% on where your directed attitude is coming from, but good on you for consistence!

&gt; I wonder how you'd feel if someone from another country wanted to invade parts of your land

I have no land. I rent my house.

&gt; aka basically almost the whole land except for some few pieces of land, called ""reserves""

Reserves were developed way, way after Europeans started moving in. Those areas were already considered American land. Thus:

&gt; where the ~~Euro~~Americans ~~deported~~ settled these people.

In 1851, specifically, reserves were set in Oklahoma to help protect the Natives from the settlers as much as the settlers from the Natives.

&gt; [They couldn't even leave their sacred place of hunting untouched in Dakota because they wanted to mine that gold and exploit that land to its bone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hills_Gold_Rush).

Well... Yeah. You realize that gold rushes were a [big thing that happened all over the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_rush), right? They still happen on occasion. That it was Native land has no real bearing on anything. It could have been the spot where Jesus was buried and it would have been torn to pieces to get to the gold.

&gt; Oh but it's ok because you traded it, isn't it?

I didn't trade anything with anyone.

&gt; ~~You~~ The US government in 1830 basically [blackmailed them](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Removal_Act) saying ""we buy your land for a few rifles

Well, except that Jackson's original statement was ""You get the west of the Mississippi."" He honestly thought, and considering the thinking of the time was likely correct, that if the Five Nations didn't assimilate as citizens to receive *legal* protections, they were leaving themselves open to being wiped out by angry state militias. By moving to federal lands and becoming wards of the federal government, the nations could have, in theory, been allowed a measure of independence while still receiving federal protections.

&gt; exploiting the fact that you don't have the concept of private property nor market

Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. If there's no concept of personal property and ownership, nor market, then there's no ""their land"" nor ""trade"" in play here. So... Nothing happened. They didn't own the land as they had no concept of ownership, nor did they need to trade. Well ain't that convenient!

&gt; and if you oppose we are gonna kill you like This or this.""

Both of those happened *after* the Indian Removal Act. Man you are just *really* bad at this whole concept of linear time. But as pointed out, things [aren't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Creek_massacre) exactly [black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cookes_Canyon) and [white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_War_of_1862#Early_fighting) in history. Lots of awful things were done by lots of awful people for lots of awful reasons, no one is denying that.

&gt; It's not that big of a piece of news that the reasons behind the massavres by EuroAmericans towards Natives were often the"" ethnic cleansing"" of the ""barbarian uncivilised race"".

Citation needed. Because if you look at the actual [list of Indian Massacres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_massacres) you'll see that the reasons most often were either war, expansion, or retaliation. In fact, there's fewer than ten on that list where white people attacked without any provocation at all, which would indicate some form of racial motivation.

Washington considered the Natives equals. Jackson fought the Seminole, yet wanted to try and protect the tribes from state militias. A lot of southerners didn't like Natives and wanted their farmland for themselves, yet a good many also fought for them, from local mayors all the way up to senators in Congress. As westward expansion was going on, some settlers were able to settle *with* Native tribes rather than force them out.

&gt; We also have the ground wire longer than the rest, but the plugs are factory molded so you can't pull them apart by hand.

We also often have plugs that are moulded in one main piece on expensive appliances that need to prevent tampering.

&gt;With no major carmakers due to make spending decisions on new models in the first half of this year, the amount of investment in the six-month period had been expected to be relatively low. 

Investment was already expected to be low.

&gt;Investment in the UK car industry last year was £1.66bn, which was down from the £2.5bn in investment recorded in 2015,

Investment was already down by almost half this time last year between 2015 and 2016, most likely due to a slow down in new car model designs and a slow down in total in the sale of vehicles.

&gt;""It’s very difficult to cost investment if you don’t know what your output price is going to be,” said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, pointing to Brexit-related uncertainty. “The industry wants a lot more certainty.”

Companies are not looking to pull out, they just want more certainty. They are being prudent and holding back dedicating large amounts of money to a situation that may change.

&gt;When carmakers allocate new models, their manufacturing plants around the world bid for the work. Historically, the UK has fared well in bidding for business from such carmakers as Nissan, Honda, Toyota and Vauxhall. 

This section of the artciel may be factually correct, but it does not gel with the prior section of the article where it states a lot of the slow down is due to a lack of new designs being released by motor companies in general, so there are no new designs *to* be bid on. Even then, the UK has some of the largest car plants in the world, and therefore some of the highest manufacturing capability. They would still be very competitive in most ways.

&gt;BMW recently said it may begin making the electric Mini outside of the UK, saying that “the result of the EU referendum creates uncertainty for the automotive sector in general and for overseas investors in particular”.

Keyword here is 'may'. It is not certain at all. BMW is basing this prediction off of a bad result in negotiations with the EU, which is unlikely to happen as both the UK and EU want a strong UK as well as an EU that is doing at least somewhat well. At least for the short term.

""There are few things I feel confident in predicting with any certainty, but of this one I am certain. History will judge mercilessly President Trump's reported decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement as the height of folly, where greed, cynicism, shortsightedness and ignorance triumphed over intelligence and leadership.

 

The implications for this action are far-reaching. There is hope that the rest of the world will move on, **and the forces in this country at the state, local, and corporate level can lessen some of the repercussions**. Renewable energy is on the rise, thanks also to market forces. But more is needed. Much more. This is not an issue with which we can trifle, and although Mr. Trump at his age and with his wealth will likely be immune to most of the long term consequences of his action, his descendants and those of his willing enablers will not.

 

That is the headline, but what is also clear is that the United States is no longer a leader. We have ceded the moral high ground to countries like those in Europe and even China who have no trouble understanding science and reason. This is a long-term threat to our own health and prosperity. We are retreating where we should be charging forward. We say we can't when we should be saying we can. We are buying into an antiquated view of our global environment that will only isolate us and diminish us.

 

These are the stakes. Time is running out on the environment. It is time for some profiles in courage of Republicans in Congress to push back on the denialism that has wracked their party. And it is time for all of us to say that this is an issue of the top priority. Our elected leaders need to feel the heat - not only the thermostat but at the ballot box.""

Oh no. That's some twisted logic. You can't get away with the murder of thousands of women and children, the [ethnic cleansing] (http://www.crimemagazine.com/ethnic-cleansing-native-americans)  and the conquest of another people's land by saying ""oh, they were ok with that so it doesn't matter"".

They were not ok with that, they simply didn't know. They were like naive children in the field of market and private property. ""You"" (read:Euro-americans) exploited that ignorance and naivety and backstabbed them all.

Reducing social mobility is terrible for the economy because it increases inequality, which massively reduces spending power.

Therefore, measures that reduce social mobility are bad for all of us in the long run.  The issue arises in the fact that British politicians have always failed to consider long term prosperity over short term electioneering - hence why this idiotic argument is still being played out across the country. 

Also, government spending on benefits and healthcare breaks the generational cycle of poverty, which has a huge effect on stuff like teen pregnancy rates - this plummeted under Labour taking the UK from one of Europe's highest teen pregnancy rates in the early nineties, to one of the lowest.
