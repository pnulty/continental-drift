And then the second half hit me hard. The girl I'd proposed to, and was thinking of going forward to marriage with by next year, and I broke up in truly a ground shattering way. It was a 4 yr relationship, and even 4 months after the breakup, I'm still not able to smile genuinely. A day after the breakup, I failed the exam that would have given me my professional career designation and moved me wayyyyy up. A month after that, I got into a car crash from which I don't know how I walked out. Car was totally destroyed. (Got a new car after) A month after that, I got laid off from the job I'd gotten after graduation. (Got a new job after)

For 2016, I want to turn things around in the following ways: 

1. Be confident in my career choice and move to this new company.

2. Complete that exam that I previously failed and just be DONE.

ETC som vanligt subpar nivå när det gäller journalistiken, inte undra på att dem lagt så mycket krut på att verkligen maximera presstödet ifrån staten. Ren stöld ifrån folket om man frågar mig.

Löfven släppte solidariteten långt innan det, då snackar vi om den egna befolkningsgruppen som lever i Sverige vare sig den är vit eller brun. Det är tragiskt jag måste använda yttre irrelevanta attributer i detta stycke, men folk är tyvärr dumma i huvudet och tror att hudfärg och det man har innan för huvudet är relevant. (LO, SVT mfl JA jag menar er)

Men man valde att köra på med Reinfeldts internationella solidaritet istället, där vi ska vara någon sorts världsföredöme när det kommer till humanitära flyktingmottaganden i siffror. 
Rödgröna fattar inte att alliansen brydde sig mindre om att hjälpa dem som har det svårt, utan snarare mer intresserade att skapa flyktingtryck mot redan svaga EU-gränser. 
Nu har människor med löften om guld och gröna skogar slängt sina besparingar i sjön, sålt sina marker för betala giriga flyktingsmugglare som ser tillfälle att fylla båtar som är direkt livsfarliga för snabba cash.
Nu har vi  hundratusentals flyktingar och immigranter i EU som behöver arbete, då hamnar man i en situation man får antingen använda skattemedel eller lönedumpningar för att sätta dessa i arbete. 
Vilka vinner på det? Företagen och kapitalister så klart. Men det kommer ta tid så klart.. Vem gynnar det? Så klart kapitalisterna som blir överösta med skattepengar för ta hand om flyktingarna och migranterna.

Vilka blir drabbade?
När dem rika slinker undan så beskattar man pöbeln eller lånar (återigen gynnar kapitalisterna).. för de med pengar vet och har insikt hur man skatteplanerar... sen kan man alltid låtsas vara solidarisk men ändå skatteplanera... påkommen?? äsch bara skylla på sin revisor.. svenska journalistkåren höjjer inte ens ögonbrynet..

Dra in biståndet till de fattiga i närområderna som har det jävligt dåligt idag.. alla dessa vi tyvärr omöjligt kan ta hand om i Sverige, om man inte lever i någon ideologisk fantasivärld där vi kan ta hand om alla miljarder som har det sämre än i vårt långa land..

Varför inte bidra till att bygga en bättre värld ute i världen istället för att föra en politik som gör det sämre för det som redan har det dåligt och bara gynna dem som har råd med frikostiga lösningar som hjälper få medans det överöser andra med rikedomar.

Jag snacka om precis detta scenario över ett år sen på både fackmöten samt internt och må våran arbetarrörelse gå under p g a egen inkompetens och arrogans. Istället för tänka själva kör man på moderpartiets association politik. åh SD tycker SD säger SD gör SD kan inte tycka som SD rasister SD.. jävla besatthet.

De agerar på alla vis som gynnar kapitalisterna och lukrativa företag. Tro sig kunna få någon sorts humanist titel i samma veva..

Men lova en jävla massa till folk i nöd, helt verklighetsfrånvarande och slösa på folkets pengar på detta vis.

The thing is, despite being the top 10% of asian guys, they have trouble getting women of other races. That's why you see threads asking how to make themselves more appealing to non-asians. Bros give asian guys shit all the time asking ""why do you only hook up with asian girls?"" The truth is, asian guys would like to hookup with different races, it's just that other races don't seem to be that attracted to asians.

How? Please back up the statement. I studied anthropology for quite a few years, the difference in cranial volume by population is old news and so well established no-one has challenged it. And brain size correlation (EQ) to IQ (again, anthropology) isn't questioned either, not when comparing ancient remains. I'm sure Gould must of known this, given the level of research he had to do.

As I recall an anthropologist (unconnected) remeasured a sample of the crania back in the eighties and found Morton's measurements were correct. 

The Penn. state team verified that Morton didn't fake the results, which was one of Gould's claims. And if anything he made any minor errors in measurement in favour of the African crania The story about Morton packing in the seed to make European volumes seem bigger was pure fabrication. You should read what John Hawkes has to say on this; scathing doesn't cover it.

Gould never had a good name in anthropology or psychology, but it's pretty much mud now.

A single payer system and other things he wants to do will literally drag economic growth into the ground.

As to neocon economic thinking of the last 30 years, you're right.. it failed because of corporatism and the aristocracy that tends to control congress.  Von Mises and Bastiat however have been providing well regarded rebuttals to anyone that thinks the state is capable of anything other than tyranny on an economic sense (really any other sense) for around 150 years.

Bernie has proved his complete incompetence with his comments about how unsecured student loans should have a lower interest rate than loans secured by real estate.  He also has shown complete lack of basic knowledge about how the fed works when he wrote his commentary on how he views the Fed and their recent actions.  His comments about putting laypeople (farmers and the like) on the Fed's Board of Governors shows he is incompetent. He commented about the Fed not being transparent enough when it is independently audited and free for anyone to take a look at the books further shows incompetence.  The Fed doesn't release unredacted minutes for good reason, it allows for good debate without having to worry about the political consequences.  Bernie wants us to be able to use political pressure to control the Fed, which is the stupidest idea.  I'm sure he's a nice guy, but in reality his economics are just plain bad and reddit for some reason has a hard on for him.  Just go to /r/finance and read the comments when something Bernie related comes up... He is cannon fodder in there for good reason.

Yes, social scientists the world over have been placed in utter thrall to their feminist overladies, and it took the profound intellect of YouTube sensation Maddox to expose the truth!

Seriously friend, you would certainly benefit from taking some intro sociology - if only so that you'd gain some insight into how incredibly, hilariously wrong that guy (and by extension, you) are. 

In general, in North American (and most European societies), women are seen as [less competent](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/89/3/416/) than their male colleagues - especially in jobs that have long been dominated by men. Which is a factor in why companies and industries that tend to be male-dominated **a)** tend to hire fewer women and, **b)** pay them less when they do.

What's more, people often associate a higher educational requirement for jobs perceived as male-dominated than those associated with women, and similarly view ""feminized"" jobs (such as [veterinary medicine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC340187/#r2-1)) as having [lower status](http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/4/1/2158244013518923) than those associated with male dominance.

Put simply, corporations don't look at the pay gap and think ""Oh man! Look at that huge untapped market of cheap labour!"" because that's not *all* they see. Study after study has shown that in addition, the folks doing the hiring for these companies also see women as less competent, less reliable, and less productive.

So do your math again, because it appears to be missing a few important variables.

Hoje temos mais médicos no país que a 25 anos atrás mas ainda sim a distribuição é brutalmente desigual, por isso que a história do mais médicos colocar 2 anos de trabalho no SUS logo após a graduação faz todo sentido, ao menos na minha opinião já que nenhum médico sai da faculdade especialista já que pelo o que eu sei o médico só se especializa depois na sua residência, além disso vai que as vezes esses 2 anos de trabalho pode fazer com que a pessoa se decidir que ao invés de querer ser um otorrino especializado em plasticas resolva virar um pediatra ?

Sim, eu tenho a percepção que um neurocirurgião perdido no meio do estado do Amazonas vai estar praticando aquilo que sabe uma ou duas vezes por ano e que por isso ele vai querer estar em um grande centro para ter mais recursos e um melhor salário, mas em lugares como o meio do estado do Amazonas é onde justamente um médico generalista mais faz falta, lugares onde pessoas chegam a morrer de diarreia por falta de conhecimento mínimo. Será que o povo que mora fora dos grandes centros, especialmente no interiorzão do país, não tem direito ou não merece a atenção médica da mesma forma que um morador de SP por exemplo?

Por mais que se diga que ninguém vai pra faculdade pensando em servir a sociedade eu acho que a pessoa que está se beneficiando de uma faculdades pública deveria ter o dever legal, já que moral a enorme maioria das vezes as pessoas não tem mesmo, de retribuir o que foi investido na educação dela, e se discordar de fazer isso que procure uma faculdade privada, o que fará ele estar plenamente dentro do direito dele. Felizmente ainda existem pessoas que tem a percepção de quanto essas coisas são importantes, como por exemplo aquele ex-catador que virou médico no DF (se não me engano) ou a ex-faxineira que virou juíza na BA, mas infelizmente o que eu vejo com ENORME frequência é que a maioria absoluta dos alunos de faculdades públicas, especialmente nos cursos mais ""premium"" como medicina, odonto, direito, são um bando de filhinhos que poderia muito bem ter o ""paitrocínio"" em uma faculdade privada mas que tá lá tirando o espaço de pessoas que não só (no meu entendimento) mereceriam muito mais estar naquelas vagas mas como também se preocupam em dar para de volta a sociedade uma contraprestação pelo ensino que tiveram porque eles sabem o que é ficar horas na fila do SUS para ser atendido ao contrário do filho de papai que começa a tossir vai pro Albert Einstein ou pro Hospital Copa D'Or, ou tem que pegar senha para voltar daqui 2 meses na defensoria pública porque não tem dinheiro para pagar um advogado privado.

* An independent Europe is a Europe that would have to spend far more on defense than it currently does, to the point where a good deal of government services would have to be curtailed. Government provided medical care would definitely face cuts if Europeans now had to spend enough on defense to ward off not only Russia but also the United States.

* A Europe that is not aligned with either the United States or Russia is a Europe that Russia and the United States could align together against. The Kremlin has been trying to find some sort of arrangement with the United States where both sides divide the world into spheres for years, Putin would be only too happy to ally with the US to conquer Europe. Europe would be hard pressed to deal with the threat of Russia's endless sea of tanks in the east, and the world's largest navy and airforce to west. 

* Two of the strongest military powers in Europe -Turkey and the United Kingdom- are closer to the United States than the rest of Europe, along with plenty of growing military powers such as Poland. An independent Europe would almost certainly be a fractured Europe as many European countries would rather be aligned with the United States than with a European bloc if they could only choose one.

In this situation, because they were in the states, both walked away without injury. Apparently in Europe there would have been a fight and the weaker could have been hospitalized.

Also, to be honest looking at what happened to Muslim/Turkish civilians in the Balkans after loss of Turkish rule its good that Turkey invaded and still protects the people in Cyprus.

""What's the story?"" he asked, grunting in his thick Dublin accent with the throaty gasping voice of a heavy smoker, looking toward DS O'donnell. ""It's the Zodiac gang"" said McKenna's partner.

""O bloody hell what is it this time?"" McKenna complained.
""It's  Ivan Ibrahimović, he's been shot."" sighed O'donnell.
""Which one is that again?"" McKenna inquired.
""Taurus."" O'donnell stated.
DCI McKenna leant down and lifted the plastic tarpaulin, soaked by not only the rain but the pool of blood which had formed around the body which was concealed, the body of the dead Zodiac gang member.

McKenna recoiled in distaste as the stench of death reached his nostrils, a dark musky horrid stench, which he knew he would smell for a few days to come. He felt his stomach turn slightly as his eyes began to adjust to the darkness of the side street and he could make out the injuries which covered the body. This killing was brutal, the body had been maimed all over, covered in deep bloody gouges and grooves all certainly done post-mortem guessing from the gunshot wound which occupied the area where his heart had once presided. 

The Zodiac gang were 12 brothers and their father, the Ibrahimović family, who had immigrated from eastern Europe. The police weren't sure exactly which country however. Since they had arrived in London around 10 years ago they had quickly established a criminal empire, getting theirs hands dirty in just about any business the could find, from contract killings; to drug smuggling. 

""This is bad fucking news"" McKenna rasped angrily, pulling a fresh cigarette from his pocket and lighting it in his mouth ""any leads?"".
""No nothing, as of yet. The state of the body makes me think this isn't gang related though, too rough."".

When they arrived back at the station and walked in McKenna was called over to the front desk. Angela the secretary informed him that there was someone there to see him, and he was waiting in McKenna's office. 

Slightly surprised he made toward his office but stopped as his recognised the slim, recognisable figure of the head of the Ibrahimović family, Dmitri, the father, otherwise known as Sagittarius. McKenna hastened toward his office rather nervously, however very intrigued. He grasped the brass handle of his old rickety wooden door and pushed the door open with some effort as it was too large for it's frame and always stuck. As McKenna fell loudly into his office Dmitri span around and fixed him with an intense gaze. 

Ibrahimović senior was not someone McKenna wanted to mess with, indeed he was thin, frail and looked like he would topple at the slightest touch. But McKenna knew that he was deadly and his sons were even more so.

""Hello, detective McKenna"" Dmitri said, in a decent English accent, but with an unmistakeable eastern European lilt in his voice.

""We need your help""...

My parents separated when I was 8 and my dad left the state the following year. As I went through high school and those first years in college, I just wanted to be a bachelor for the rest of my life. More on this in a few paragraphs. 

When I met said college sweetheart, I honestly didn't think it would last as we were polar opposites. However, things were amazing and she quickly became my best friend and the person I knew I wanted to spend my entire life with. We were in the process of buying a house which quickly went to shit once she decided she wanted a divorce. No rhyme or reason, she just wanted out. I tried everything to salvage the relationship, but she wanted none of it. Seven years invested and it was all over. 

A few months after the divorce, I met a great woman who was in a similar situation to mine. We both thought it was love at first sight, but she was also another polar opposite (but in different arenas than my ex). Things were great for the most part, but then there was a disconnect. 

There was a moment with my marriage that I could pinpoint things became different, but I didn't realize it at the time. Towards the end, my wife began going out with her coworkers on a more consistent basis. My friends believe she cheated on me with a specific individual that she became good friends with a few months prior to the end of our marriage. I never thought anything of it with hanging out with this specific individual, because I trusted her. Similar thing happened with my last relationship. When she began doing her second leg of field work at a local hospital and hanging out with the employees there, things changed. I saw her less and less, was never invited out with her friends, and ultimately the relationship was over once we returned from our trip to Europe. That honestly hurt more than the dissolve of the marriage. I thought things would be different, but I ended up back at square one more hurt than I was before. I thought I learned my mistakes from the marriage, but I didn't. It took a second go around to realize what went wrong and how to better and improve myself. 

I would love to find that one person that I could be with for the rest of my life and we live together and have a family full of dogs (fuck kids). One of the realizations I had during my new tenure of being single is to find someone who does share common interests with me because clearly that saying of ""opposites attract"" is complete horseshit. 

However, I look at my best friend who I've known since senior year of high school. He has never had a LTR. The longest one (six months) ended right before I went to Europe and it probably didn't help that it was a LDR too. She didn't want to move from Miami to Vegas, and honestly, I can't blame her. This place sucks. Now my best friend is a good looking guy and is wildly successful; he graduated law school at 25 and is already the general counsel for one of the larger production companies here in town. He's a great catch. He's on dates practically every week, but he's jaded, miserable, and pessimistic about love. I still have some optimism even through its dying fast. 

Being single has its benefits. I get to travel constantly now, meet new people, and I don't have to worry about anyone who is not me. I get to be picky now about who that next person I fall in love with is. However, there is that dread of loneliness. I know what being in love feels like and it sucks that I now have to go back into the dating scene which is a dumpster fire, especially when you're closer to 30. I've had success recently going on dates with women younger than me (21-24), but someone closer to my age with shared interests in practically non-existent. We all have our baggage, but my baggage thankfully is a carry on and not checked bags (like women with [multiple] children). 

Maybe we might find those women we can settle down with, maybe we might not. However, at this point, I'm just going along for the ride. 

I've already typed for far too long and now I'm late for meeting up with friends.

False,0,,t5_2s599,36,36,thelordofthelight,"In the EU Vader is scared of Sidious' lightning because it's fucking overpowered as fuck, like everything Sidious does. Not because he's afraid of a little lightning.

Remember how much lightning Starkiller had to use to bring down Vader? That's the reason why Dooku's lightning is doing nothing here, but also because it's just going to get absorbed by a saber.

Edit: Here's what the novelization says

&gt;Vader himself fought more cautiously than he had on the Death Star, the last time they had dueled in earnest. His armor seemed to have improved, too; it was less vulnerable to lightning than it had been just days before.

&gt;But the same was true in reverse. And when Vader forced Starkiller onto his back foot and raised his lightsaber to strike him down, **Starkiller fired a lightning blast into the side of Vader's armor that was so concentrated, even the new insulation couldn't absorb it.**

&gt;The Dark Lord stiffened, betrayed by his extensive prosthetics. **The distraction lasted only a moment**, but it was enough. Starkiller knocked his blade out of the way and moved in to strike.

..

And they keep fighting for several pages.

And again

&gt;**A burst of lightning arced from Starkiller's fingers. Too late, the Dark Lord raised his lightsaber to catch the attack. Lightning crawledup and down his chest plate and helmet, provoking a painful whine from his breathing apparatus**. The servomotors in his right armstrained... **Starkiller had only a split second before his former Master repelled the attack**. The Force flowed through him.

(a paragraph later)

&gt;The temptation was very strong. **Vader's blade caught the edge of the lightning.** The Dark Lord began to straighten.



[No sells a random's lightning](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111155790/3915310-4277189132-33343.jpg)

According to this source, Vader apparently died because of Sidious' dark side burst, not because of the lightning.

&gt;A livid Palpatine then used his own dark powers to attack, searing Luke with blasts of blue lightning. As he watched the agony of his son and the Emperor's glee, Vader finally broke the hold of evil that had suffocated him for so long. Vader grabbed the energy-seething Palpatine and hurled him into the Death Star reactor shaft, where the evil leader was disintegrated. **The shock waves of dark power mortally wounded Vader.** Luke Skywalker could do nothing for his dying father, the terrible enemy who had saved him in the end. -- The New Essential Chronology

So yeah, Vader doesn't have that much of a problem with lightning. Dooku's lightning is next to useless here, in fact, again mostly because it can be blocked.

There was also some comic scene where Vader easily tanks some web-lightning or something, but I can't seem to find it unfortunately. I'll link it if I do.",whowouldwin,cyi1e8r,0,,1451645316,t1_cyi15lg,t3_3yzdfx,1451622947,,1454211625

This is the issue. People love the Star Wars they met first. That's what I loved about TFA - it introduces the worlds in the style that started it all.  And it was style, in some ways over even substance.

I don't hate the prequels.  But if they'd been the only part of the Star Wars legacy, it would be over except for perhaps the EU and some of the animated stuff.  The OT is what started it all, it's what propelled it all forward, and it's what all the stuff that came after was based on.

If we were starting Star Wars now, perhaps you'd have a point.  I mean, you do have one, but perhaps it would be persuasive.  The film is on it's way to the highest grossing film of all time.  JJ knows how to world-build, as do those coming after.  Rogue One, SW VIII - you aren't going to be disappointed for long.

&gt;In 2005, Cosby goes on a massive tirade against thug lyfe yo culture.

&gt;Actually, here’s the real text of it: *They’re standing on the corner and they can’t speak English. I can’t even talk the way these people talk: Why you ain’t, Where you is, What he drive, Where he stay, Where he work, Who you be… And I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk. And then I heard the father talk.*

&gt;*Everybody knows it’s important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can’t be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth. In fact you will never get any kind of job making a decent living.
People marched and were hit in the face with rocks to get an education and now we’ve got these knuckleheads walking around. The lower economic people are not holding up their end in this deal. These people are not parenting. They are buying things for kids.*

&gt;*$500 sneakers for what? And they won't spend $200 for Hooked on Phonics. I am talking about these people who cry when their son is standing there in an orange suit. Where were you when he was 2? Where were you when he was 12? Where were you when he was 18 and how come you didn't know that he had a pistol? And where is the father? Or who is his father? People putting their clothes on backward: Isn’t that a sign of something gone wrong? People with their hats on backward, pants down around the crack, isn’t that a sign of something? Isn’t it a sign of something when she has her dress all the way up and got all type of piercings going through her body? What part of Africa did this come from? We are not Africans. Those people are not Africans; they don’t know a thing about Africa.*

&gt;*I say this all of the time. It would be like white people saying they are European-American. That is totally stupid.*

&gt;*I was born here, and so were my parents and grandparents, and, very likely, my great grandparents. I don’t have any connection to Africa, no more than white Americans have to Germany, Scotland, England, Ireland, or the Netherlands. The same applies to 99% of all the black Americans as regards to Africa. So stop, already! With names like Shaniqua, Taliqua, and Mohammed and all of that crap. And all of them are in jail.*

&gt;*Brown or black versus the Board of Education is no longer the white person’s problem. We have got to take the neighborhood back. People used to be ashamed. Today a woman has eight children with eight different “husbands”–or men or whatever you call them now.*

&gt;*We have millionaire football players who cannot read. We have million-dollar basketball players who can't write two paragraphs. We, as black folks, have to do a better job.*

&gt;*Someone working at Wal-Mart with seven kids; you are hurting us. We have to start holding each other to a higher standard. We cannot blame the white people any longer.*

&gt;Not even a year later, the first rape accusation surfaces.

&gt;It's a massive spectacle, but NO other victims step forward. NONE.

&gt;Cosby isn't even charged, due to **absolutely NO evidence.** None, zero.

&gt;Ten years pass.

&gt;Trayvon happens, Brown happens.

&gt;Cosby is still telling blacks to stop killing and raping each other while not speaking properly or wearing properly sized pants.

&gt;Suddenly, like 40 victims step forward, all claiming they were raped by Cosby 30 fucking years ago, all telling the exact same story.

&gt;NO charges, because there's **no evidence** in fucking ANY OF THEM.

&gt;Butthurt, they instead try to sue him for slander.

&gt;EVEN THAT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THERE'S NO EVIDENCE FOR EVEN THAT.

&gt;The accuser count is now over 100. Over fucking 100. And no charges yet because EVEN IN 100 ACCUSATIONS OF DRUGGINGS AND RAPES, **THERE IS NO PROOF.** IN 100+ GODDAMN FUCKING CASES, IN NOT ONE OF THEM IS THERE ANY FUCKING EVIDENCE. NONE.

&gt;Suddenly, judges claim ""the statute of limitations starts when a woman claims she first remembers it!"".

&gt;And yet, STILL no charges, STILL no evidence.

&gt;After two years of this, they find the one single case in which the statute of limitations isn't up, and do everything they possibly can to charge him with it, despite **no evidence at all.**

Catholic - Roman script.

The next big change was Martin Luther decided to speak out about the church being, essentially, a protection racket. - Split between Protestants - Northern Europe; and Catholics - Southern Europe. Cue big wars, much death and mayhem, and the rebirth of Northern Europe as the driving engine of modern science, art, colonisation, and military power.

Why? Because every other religion said: 'If it happens, it's because God wanted it to. I'm just gonna hang out and let shit happen.' Protestants said: 'God put me here to do cool shit, I'm going to invent the steam engine.'

The top google search results for my name links to “Banned Canadian CS:GO professional Joshua ‘steel’ Nissan”. People don’t seem to grasp how poorly this reflects on me. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Since I can remember, I’ve always been trying to do things on my own. I felt weird asking for help, even from my family. I needed to do things on my own and show that I am capable. I deal with everything on my own. Especially my depression. I’ve carried this baggage for over a decade. I remember when I was first told I was “depressed” when I was 16. I thought that’s what “normal” felt like. But I’ve since felt happiness. There were periods of time that I was happy. I chased this happiness across the world, quite literally. It took me to Europe and back. Competing in CS brought me happiness. Travelling and meeting everyone involved brought me happiness. Now that’s gone again.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I’m fortunate enough to have a handle on my own situation, but not everyone is as lucky as me. I don’t like talking about my personal life and I’ve done my best for years to keep private parts about my life private. All that is changing tonight because I’m in the position to do more.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Last night I had mentioned I was donating my FPL earnings for the month to charity. It blew up in a reddit post but still there were people who came in to shit all over everything. It seems like no matter my intentions, some people will never let go or change their perspective of me and that’s completely fine. But they’re wrong and that’s all that matters.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I’ve ordered my new chequebook which will see a lot of use this year. To start it off, I’m pledging $10 000 to the family foundation which I’m a part of. As a director, I am going to have the funds split between the following Canadian charities:  Canadian Mental Health Association, Defeat Depression, and Pathways to Education. Additionally, every dollar I earn from competing in CS:GO after expenses in 2016 will be sent to the foundation. I don’t know what that will amount to, but it will include any and all local events I am allowed to participate at, as well as other things I am eligible to participate in such as FPL.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Through the years I’ve gotten by with CS as my crutch. I never dreamed it would become my job, I never thought I could make a living out of it. I played it because it made me happy. What happens when your distraction becomes the reason that you’re distracted? What happens when CS becomes the reason you need therapy?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I still to this day need to drink to get through some of my streams. But I’m to have learned about myself early on. Going to University was never something that I wanted. I only went so I had an excuse to study psychology to understand myself better. Not everyone has the same opportunities that I had.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Streaming has been good to me. This year I have the opportunity to help others. Be safe. Happy New Year.""

Edit: Hmm, it only looks like it supports my point. Seems like it stresses multiple times that the peoples' fighting force against tyranny would consist of a well-organized and well-regulated militia. 

""Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the State governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger. The highest number to which, according to the best computation, a standing army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This proportion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a **militia** amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a **militia** thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the British arms, will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it. Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the **militia** officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers **appointed out of the militia, by these governments**, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.""

Not any laws. It has to be a very serious law, such as immigration law or actual crime. They cannot deport me if I urinate in a public place. 

&gt; Also your residency can be stripped if you leave the country for more than 6 months out of the year. Plus, citizenship is cheaper on the long run since you do not have to renew the greencard every 10 years.

I've removed 50-100 ticks from myself in my life. At most I had a dozen at the same time. I'm not that unusual, everyone here has had ticks.

You have a point about how we need to be careful about where this country heads, but that doesn't just apply to youth: there are many ways a country can fall. Sweden, for example, fell for the immigration trap. Crime statistics, especially rape has skyrocketed in that country, and many experts agree that Sweden is deteriorating so fast they're projecting it to be a third world country by 2030.


The way the EU has been handling immigration this past year is clearly unsustainable and is simply asinine. You're incredibly naive, even though you may have more years than me, if you think kindness will solve all the world's problems. No it will not stop religious fanatics from killing people either.


Your generation was not ""nearly as depressed and anxious and acerbic as the younger generation is,"" because you grew up in safer times both politically and financially. The fact is plenty of youth are struggling to make a comfortable life for themselves, instead of blaming their problems on videogames or pop culture or other dumb shit, you need to recognize that there IS a problem.


You mentioned rebelling too. Many people are rebelling because society has swung to far to the left. So it's natural they'd kneejerk to the right to even things out. Fighting insanity with slightly more sane insanity is how I like to think of it.

- In the Info Kiosk there are no ingredients, so the map is made out of tin air?

- The ability for making shops close and open like the rides

- no X64 client? Game uses the max amount of memory on my system an sometimes it makes my system crash.

- like some comments below, a side entrance for the goods to be delivered;

- faster transport for the goods (like golfcart/transport band/...)

- hotels/restaurants/swimming pools/golfcourts/... eg. something just for fun and not real rides

- if I select a worker/ride or something in a window I want it to be better visibly that I selected the thing (put the selected item in a other Collor?). Now I find it hard to see if I have 1 of my 30 workers selected in the overview.

- no days in the time? Now its hard to see when a month is over.

- shops needs to be placed in subcategories (eg. Food/drinks/other) (like some comment ago ;) )

- seasons (snow/hot summer/rainy autumn) that affects the sale of goods. Eg if its warm more drinks selling and less warm food...

- the name off the rides on the billboards in front off the queues and some info if its open/closed/defect/wait time/...

- park finances needs to be stored in archives so I can see only the active year in the main overview, but I can go to the archives to see how I did in the past.

- rides needs to have some sort of maintance budget/cost for it (like electricity) or just to it globally on the whole park (economy?)

- Different park entrances (little park with 1 entrance lane/big parks (like Disneyland with 10+ entrance lanes.

- The ability to set the currency of the game to Euro (or other) and not dollar for us Europeans (or other).

- buildings where whe can store trash so whe don't have to go to the entrance every time

- If i open a saved coaster and i see the select window, when i pres the escape key the windows doesnt close and i get the main window instead (resume/save/load/settings/quit)

&gt; Passengers on a ship traveling from Mexico to Europe in the 1930s represent society at large in that era. The crew is German, including the ship's doctor who falls in love with one of the passengers, La Contessa. A young American woman, Jenny, is traveling with the man she loves, David. Jenny is fascinated and puzzled by just who some of the other passengers are. The once famous Mary Treadwell gets much of her attention.
(*IMDb*)

**Critical reception:**
&gt; Although both acclaimed critically and well received by audiences, Ship of Fools was looked at by some reviewers as a Grand Hotel afloat, the 1932 film that was often aped. ""Preachy and melodramatic"" was another criticism, although the cast was universally praised.

4) Anyone can get a pay-as-you-go phone/plan - that's easiest.  If you're dead-set on a contract, you'll need to get a bank account first.

3) You don't need much for an NI number, just an address they can send stuff to as you quite rightly say - doesn't have to be your place, just a semi-permanent residence you're living at.  Having an NI number is no indicator of your right to work in the UK, just a mechanism through which you can be taxed, so they're a lot less difficult to obtain than you might think.  You will almost certainly be required to attend an interview, however.

1. An online subscription based student essay database website back in '96. Sold several years ago and still running. Never made much. Lesson learned: students are poor, better choose a product or service with a more affluent target audience.

2. Online service to decrypt locked, password-lost MS documents by brute force. I outsourced the processing power required to a company in Australia. Failed. Reason: there wasn't enough demand for the service and the IT overhead was too high. Data protection became an issue too.

3. 1 page double sided A3 what's on guide for tourists in a large city. 5,000 copies delivered to 100 hotels etc. every week. 32 advertising spots sold for 100 Euros/week. I ran it for 2 years with my gf, writing the content, selling the ads and doing the distribution ourselves (10 hours every weekend dragging a heavy trolly around on foot!). Was successful and cleared 2-3k / month but the commitment of self publishing and distributing a weekly publication took it's toll and wasn't sustainable. Sold for 15k. The business wasn't scalable or able to be run passively one day - it didn't generate enough to hire staff. Both of these attributes are very important.

4. A chain of franchised printer cartridge recycling shops in a major city. On paper (well, Excel) the business was a wet dream. Ink costs nothing and you can sell a refilled cartridge for 50-70% of the price of a new one. Margins in the 2000% range. What we failed to appreciate was a) the difficulty in sourcing good quality empties. Demand outstripped supply. b) the original manufacturer's response to this growing industry - make their cartridges damn near impossible to refill. c) the influx of cheap Chinese clones to the European market. d) considerable competition from other franchise chains as well as independents. I saw the light after a couple of years and sold my stake. My partner went the other way and bought the master rights for the whole country, managed to sell 20 or so franchises but eventually the whole thing failed. Lesson: timing is important. Had we set the business up a decade earlier it would have been very successful. Also, I learned that knowing when to give up the fight is just as important as perseverance. Don't let your heart rule your head.

5. Window cleaning. Buy a ladder, a squeegee and a bucket and hey presto, you're in business! Until you get threatened with violence by existing window cleaners whose territory you've invaded... Aside from the fact that all I did was create a job for myself with little chance to build into a solid business, I failed to appreciate the willingness of the competition to physically remove me from the equation. I was only 19 when I did this though, which makes it a little less embarrassing!

6. Import business. 20 years ago savvy manufacturers started to get their act together and created websites showcasing their products. I researched products that I thought might have a market in the country where I was living at the time. The cost and complexity of the importing process, insufficient funding and the extreme difficulty in even getting my products reviewed by the major retailers ended that one after a year or so.

7. Freelance IT support. I did this for several years and was reasonably successful, making about 3k / month. Essentially it was just a job though, and I jumped when the cartridge refilling opportunity came along.

There have been a few others, but they didn't really progress much from the initial idea and research phase. Hope this has been of help :)",Entrepreneur,cyi7qyz,0,,False,t1_cyhl4dc,t3_3yu3lh,1451646179,,1454214618

It's not just with LEGO. It's with everything in Australia as you no doubt know. And I don't think it's companies being sneaky. I think it's a logistical fact with distribution and keeping industries alive. If you want toy shops, book shops, music shops etc. to stay open, they need to charge a higher price. For example, the reason books cost so much in Australia is because without that price the Australian publishing industry wouldn't exist.

And I think LEGO is the same. Without the RRP being what it is, there would be no business incentive for LEGO to sell to Australia. You have a country nearly twice the size of the European Union but with less than 5% of its population. And it's on the other side of the world! So when you factor in all the overheads that come with shipping, distributing, stocking, selling, and promoting toys and models in a country as vast as Australia, it makes sense. It sucks balls but it makes sense.

Civilians who originally supported them have begun leaving their occupied territories in droves, and in order to stop their now ragtag army from dissolving entirely, the hardliners have had to employ ever more brutal methods to keep the les fanatic soldiers in line - like when they recently executed a few dozen troops for refusing to wear suicide vests.and have killed hundreds of other soldiers for being either unable to fight or wanting to defect to other groups
http://www.torontosun.com/2015/10/29/isis-executes-200-of-its-own-trying-to-defect-to-fight-russians


The key reason is that they're  frankly beginning to lose the war, for the exact same reasons that other fascist power- Nazi Germany-also lost its own war in Europe, Making too many enemies too soon, and relying on Blitzkrieg tactics to overwhelm weaker foes without a  long term contingency plan to fight a war of attrition against better armed and funded armies. Chiefly because they felt their cause was just and that was all that mattered. 


The battle of Kobani against the Kurds at the Turkish border late last year was their Stalingrad - they through everything they had into the fight and lost.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Koban%C3%AE
 Now without veteran units their entire offensive campaign ground to a halt, and it became reduced to a matter of trying to plug the numerous holes with foreign suburban recruits and any Sunni Arab they could scrape up- Most of the Kurdish offensives this year have been met (relatively speaking) by little more than pot-shots , the only ISIS fighters not simply running for the hills  being groups of lone snipers and suicide bombers (Take a look at this VICE documentary to see what I mean https://news.vice.com/video/pushing-back-the-islamic-state-the-battle-for-rojava-dispatch-1)


ISIS is under pressure on nearly all fronts, and Thanks to Russian and NATO air strikes, their ability to wage large mechanised offensives beyond simply local counterattacks has been nullified, by this time next year, they will probably be reduced by the same manner African Islamist groups like Boko Haram in Nigeria, Al Shabaab in Somalia and other groups in Mali have been - chased out of the cities and towns they ruled over and continuing their campaign as a rural insurgency planting the occasional roadside bomb. 



It wont be easy to break the hold they have over the people though, and the hard fact is that many Muslims in that part of the world appear to think an Islamic state run by Sharia law is the only viable way for them to go



**Essentially my TLDR in a nutshell**- Iraq and Syria will survive ISIS, but will it survive the people who gave ISIS their power?

Agreed from Europe. I'm on the fence about a 40-team World Cup, it is okay the way it is right now, but 40 would ensure those few extra places are dished out and give more chance to smaller nations to qualify. They shouldn't go any higher though.

And I see it most in the FIFA talk around criticism of Blatter/anyone working for FIFA, on here and in the media, they seem to be stunned how Blatter can get re-elected days after all that controversy they just uncovered, not bothering to look at how the voting system works, all he has to do to get even a mid-sized country like Jamaica to vote for him is to actually listen and care about what they have to say.

Not that the executives should be immune from criticism, but it does get blown way out of proportion, they get accused of 'ruining our game' by the Eurocentrics, but what has actually been done that has had any effect on the running of European football? The only thing I can think of is the 2022 World Cup being moved to winter *(a move I disagree with as well, for World Cup tradition and not being the months Qatar bid for, etc.)*, although the complaints seem to be more that they're going to have to watch Premier League games in June or something.

&gt; An independent Europe is a Europe that would have to spend far more on defense than it currently does, to the point where a good deal of government services would have to be curtailed. Government provided medical care would definitely face cuts if Europeans now had to spend enough on defense to ward off not only Russia but also the United States.

It's probably the social care that will face more cuts. The US actually spends a lot of tax money on medical care too (even before Obamacare), but in a completely other (and less efficient in terms of universality) way. 

&gt; A Europe that is not aligned with either the United States or Russia is a Europe that Russia and the United States could align together against. The Kremlin has been trying to find some sort of arrangement with the United States where both sides divide the world into spheres for years, Putin would be only too happy to ally with the US to conquer Europe. Europe would be hard pressed to deal with the threat of Russia's endless sea of tanks in the east, and the world's largest navy and airforce to west. 

That is probably the best point you've made. Though of course you have to take into account that said Europe would probably have different allies of its own too. In your case China would become Europe's ally and it might be Russia that is more hard pressed. Though Realpolitik isn't always done that 'realistically'. There's many other ways things could go since politically the links between Europe and the US are deeper and thus wouldn't be cut as quickly.

&gt; An independent Europe would almost certainly be a fractured Europe as many European countries would rather be aligned with the United States than with a European bloc if they could only choose one. 

I think the assumption made above didn't just mean a Europe of independent states, but an independent and politically united Europe. Still vague but the assumption probably means that the states wouldn't be able to backstab each other.

&gt; Compatibility is not a major issue these days. It's literally a 5-10 minute process at most 


You... clearly don't play a lot of games, some games are running like crap or completely unplayable if they're not working on the right OS. You're mistaken here, there's a reason why GOG is doing good, because older games are usually run very badly on modern OS on steam.

&gt; this type of incompatibility is either going to not happen (recipe from mod that is last in load order will overwrite), or will be fixed with the automatic patcher.

Except you can't setup load order via Steam, and automatic patchers would still be sold separately, so it would still be broken unless someone *paid for that fix*.

&gt; By buying one mod, you should be guaranteed compatibility with every single mod that anyone can come up with forever. That's a fucking stupid thing to say.


No, I'm saying, don't sell mods unless they are setup in a way that you don't run into compatibility issues to begin with. That's Steam's duty as its their shop we're browsing. 


I don't buy the whole ""its a marketplace"" then why would Valve and Bethesda still take the majority cut of the deal if that's true?


&gt; So, in this imaginary (read: bullshit) scenario, people would pay someone else to do something that's exceptionally easy to do, and nobody would do it for free for people that are too lazy to spend 45 seconds fixing it themselves?

I'm happy for you it went that way, getting ready together and everything, just like any other girl. :) *hugs* 

My New Year's Eve went great too, I metal the bar with my best friend and a few other friends. There was one waiter who always liked coming to our table and gave me this ""I adore you"" look. He was at least in his 50s, but as he hasn't tried anything else it was nice and not scary. He even came to say good bye when his shift was finished. 

And is was nice because I was around friends, drinking mostly sparkling wine and just celebrating the good times. 

What I disliked were the fireworks. I mean nice to look at them, but I really hate the fact we are celebrating with explosives while in parts of the world explosives are used to bring death and destruction and fear. Even here in Europe. 
Plus, it's free available firework over here, and it's really scary to see a bunch of drunk guys playing around with such dangerous goods. 

I'm now a little hung over, but I think it was worth it. 

And when we left the bar owner made no exception and hugged me like all the other women for saying goodbye. :) ",MtF,cyi9g6e,0,"MtF, 33, HRT Feb 20,2015",False,t3_3z0h5v,t3_3z0h5v,1451654923,,1454215490

You're not talking about something that is a few inches long and made of metal, you're talking about a (usually) powdered chemical, that due to being a powder is extremely small and can have it's form changed or smuggled inside someone's body. Guns are much, much, much harder to hide than drugs. Not impossible, but much harder.

Not to mention, I don't believe that guns are addictive, nor are they consumed on use, meaning you have to get another one tomorrow, nor are guns as frequently used, even legally, by gun owners today. A druggie needs their fix every day. All those factors, mean the market isn't there, meaning that drugs and guns are in no way comparable in this regard.

As for prohibition, it's a much better example, but you still have the consumption on use and frequency of use aspect, meaning there just isn't as big a market for guns as an illegal substance.

I would point to european countries, like the UK, Germany or France, who have outlawed fire arms (with a few exceptions) and it is extremely difficult to acquire one in those countries (or at least, I assume so, due to the very low gun crime rate, which includes possession of an illegal fire arm - I haven't tried to buy one myself).

And yes, I would. A semi-automatic weapon is a weapon which after firing a round, loads the next round into the chamber, ready for firing. Now, considering I answered your question, perhaps you can do me the common politeness of answering my question about fire rate?

False,0,,t5_2qpp6,21,21,All_Business,"&gt; Q: From that perspective, the StarCraft 2 industry seems to be shrinking.
&gt; 
&gt; A: **I think there's a big problem with Blizzard's policy.** **After the announcement of their plans for 2016, a lot of veteran players – especially those who were competing overseas – announced their retirement.** **Blizzard's policy regarding StarCraft 2 esports changes too often, too radically, and too unfavorably toward Korean players.** When WCS was first formed, Blizzard had no region restrictions. Korean players could compete in North America or Europe, with the idea being that if Korean players could show good games overseas, then the fans would be pleased, and Blizzard was okay with that. Because of that policy, the North America and European pro scene was crippled, and teams only focused on acquiring Korean players. Afterward, the policy eventually changed so Korean players needed citizenship, residency, visas, etc to compete, reducing their opportunities to compete. And going into 2016, the policy has changed so Korean players can't compete in international circuit tournaments. 
&gt; 
&gt; When Korean players compete abroad, they win almost all of of the time. From Blizzard's perspective, Korean players are bullfrogs destroying the ecosystem [bullfrogs are a major invasive species in Korea]. They're changing the environment in order to catch the bullfrogs, but players end up retiring or leaving the scene. When Blizzard said it was okay for them to compete abroad, they left Korea, leaving teams to disband and shrink. **Stopping them from competing in foreign tournaments now, three years later, is just forcing players to retire with no alternative.** 
&gt; 
&gt; Q: Another sad reality.
&gt; 
&gt; A: **You have to wonder if Blizzard really has any desire to help StarCraft break through its current situation.** If you look at their interviews, they say they make games with 'artistic spirit, the heart of a craftsman.' Right now, StarCraft 2 doesn't need any artisanal spirit. It needs Blizzard to act like a proud owner. All the people in the Korean StarCraft 2 esports industry have a spirit of ownership. **When they hear other people say ""StarCraft 2 is a dead game,"" they feel more hurt than Blizzard.** 
&gt; 
&gt; Brood War was the top esports game for a time, but it gave up that spot to other games, and not that many people play it any more. In this situation, Blizzard Korea employees have no problem going around saying ""StarCraft 2 isn't any fun, is it? Play other games."" in the company of pro players. I don't think that's right. Players, teams, industry workers are all doing their best to keep StarCraft 2 afloat. Saying that kind of stuff shows you don't have the right attitude. Of course, it they probably meant it as telling players to play HearthStone or Heroes of the Storm. Still, I can't understand it.

Emphasis mine. But I guess now we know 100% that the changes to WCS are a contributing factor in player retirements.

National Socialism doesn't work. We should stop trying to regulate everything from a federal level. People act as if this is how we have to do things. It shouldn't be. Let the largely metropolitan areas/cities regulate them selves (they're largely liberal and favor surveillance) and let the rural areas of the states regulate themselves (they're more conservative/libertarian). When the federal government integrated the schools it did not get rid of private schools or create one schooling system, it just made sure all states followed the laws. 

The current abstraction for what we consider a ""state"" no longer works under socialism. We need to re-define what a ""state"" is.

An even more progressive abstraction for what we refer to as a ""state"" could instead be defined as an area of land with a population &gt;x. If we want to be progressive we have to realize the benefits of having multiple interpretations of our progressive systems spread out across the land.

When my cousin's girlfriend (Slovakian) was attacked by a Polish man with a length of re-bar, she was told by police to consider the north-western area of the village (the area almost exclusively inhabited by Eastern Europeans) a no-go zone after sunset as they were unable to control the place.

Get it out of your head that bad guys are going to attack people and you need your gun to save everybody. Its not going to happen and even if it did its incredibly unlikely that you are going to be a hero and save the day.  A gun is for your own personal protection and thats it.

Spurs might just look to him to solve their striker issue. The Arsenal manager has spoken with an ex-player about Pato but I think it unlikely any move to the Emirates will happen. Spurs is, according to someone very close to the situation, one of his two preferred destinations - Barcelona being the other (although I get vthe feeling that if the question was posed again today he would say two other clubs). Clubs will have noted his wages are very high, he has some ownership issues that would need to be resolved before a return to Europe, and (importantly) he has multiple agents and representatives that would need to be paid as part of any transfer'.

Well, it does sound silly when you pick an example out of a bunch of conflict to make your point, right? Furthermore, Australia does receive refugees/migrants without prior notice, however they have the intelligence to send them away which is exactly the point of my initial statement. 

I can point to Afghanistan, Congo, Rwanda, Somalia and tons more. They're farther away than ""just miles"" (poor Turkey) and yet, (Western) Europe is, as always, paying the price for their and America's fuck ups.

Outside of that, Mann's book actually focuses around some strong arguments from respected archaeologists and anthropologists that believe North and South America were far more densely populated than we now think, perhaps containing more people than Europe itself at certain periods in time. The fulcrum of Mann's theory is that epidemics and tribal warfare destroyed these civiliziations before they were contacted in person by European explorers, and that the vision we have now of ancient America as sparsely populated is an illusion. Critics liken the argument to finding an empty bank account and concluding it must at some point have contained millions of dollars, and there is a dearth of evidence making it hard to buy the argument wholesale.

Rey is *no one*. She's just a kid; her parents took her to the Kid Pawn Shop when they ran out of money; maybe they meant to come and buy her back when they had the cash, but they didn't. Let us shed these claustrophobic webs of EU-style character relationships in this soft reboot. Let the Force not be this pedigree thing, but something that wells up in people who need it, who are receptive to it.

She's technically ""free"" but a day's labour buys her *a meal*, making it effectively impossible for her to escape offworld. And so the theories that she's Luke's daughter, that she's another Solo kid-- nah, I don't buy that. She's had to live in terrible danger as a slave girl living alone in complete poverty for 15+ years. If Luke or Leia did that deliberately that's fucking abominable.

False,0,,t5_2v1jk,5,5,ucde,"Greece's national debt was not the cause of the Greek crisis. It was specifically to whom and how it was owed. Let me explain. 

Greek bonds were high yield instruments that French, Dutch and German banks invested very heavily in around 2006-2009. These banks invested in 'periphery debt' because that debt had high yields, basically Greek, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian bonds. Their bonds had high yield because these countries were not as economically stable as others in the region, which is not and was not an issue while a nation is fiscally sovereign, e.g. can issue its own currency. Greece lived happily for 40+ years with its 'olive oil and tourism' economy, as Yanis Varoufakis commented, calling it 'a pearl in the sun'. Quite a difference from today, I'm told. Schaeuble and Brussels strangling the life out of the country is not some inevitable natural consequence that flows from southern european economic structure, its a political power play that has everything to do with the EU economic structure.

The fundamental issue with European debt is that the currency was federalized, but the debt was not. Some financial architects who were called in (most notable Martin Armstrong) during the design phase of the EU, said that they originally had a plan to federalize the debt, but that it was postponed and ultimately scrapped. Armstrong also claims to have warned them at the time, that if they didn't federalize the debt, the system would disintegrate. 

They did not federalize the debt. That means that everybody has to go begging to Daddy (Daddy = the EU commission and bureaucracy in Brussels), when they need money, instead of being empowered to create it themselves, which they formerly were. Now, it so happens that Daddy plays favorites. Some countries are Daddy's favorites. Germany and Belgium and France, are real near to daddy's heart. These are very powerful and influential kids, and when they need a loan, they get one. 

Some of the biggest banks in France, Germany and the Netherlands were threatened with insolvency by the bankrupcy of Greece. They couldn't be repayed, and everyone playing the game was also aware that Greece was just a forerunner of other bad periphery debt-producing countries. Looking at the current state of Portugal or Italy, how would you feel about owning 20 million in Portuguese or Italian bonds? Thats the larger question behind the scenes. 

So Greece had to be made an example of. They were basically economically destroyed, to demonstrate to Southern European countries that they are second class financial citizens, and that they have to pay up on their debts. If they can't find the money, they have to shut down their schools and hospitals, or they will suddenly find their supply of Euro's shut off *for them*. 

Its similar to if the U.S. would demand that Tennessee start repaying its debts, or lose electric, gas, and utilities. It would be a form of economic warfare. 

So, unless Basic Income means that a very powerful French bank comes to depend on your bond repayments for its continued existence, and that a league of powerful northern european financial interests choose to make an example of you to keep other (eastern) nations in check, the situation of Finland will probably be completely unlike Greece. 

That being said, I don't know who Brussels will choose to wage financial war on in any given year. Finland could be their next target, but so could anyone who doesn't share a land-border with Belgium.",BasicIncome,cyiegw6,0,,False,t3_3z0du1,t3_3z0du1,1451669482,,1454217856

Obama care cant hold a candle to the NHS or any European health care systems, but its a beautiful start to the idea of universal social care that the USA is petulantly and ignorantly refusing. Suffice it to say, the happiest countries in the world are, on average, the Scandinavian countries, which have the best social care system in Europe. Perhaps America would do better under a president like Bernie Sanders, who could really change the landscape like FDR did. However, it must be said that whats been done so far isnt enough, and it needs to be pushed through harder.

The prison system is still abysmal and needs heavy reform. America is the jail-house of the world, more people incarcerated there than anywhere else, and it needs to stop. On that note, drug reform and rehabilitation should be implemented rather than the idiotic and backward thinking ""Tough stance on crime"" that seems to originate with the Red Scare of 1919. 

The Gay rights movement was a brilliant success in America, but needs heavier Federal backing to stop incidents like certain states still refusing federal laws to marry legal citizens of the US. But that may come in time.

As many have said, Guantanimo is a major issue that needs to be addressed, but I somehow doubt it will be. No one in congress wants to touch the issue, and as good as an Executive order is, I dont know enough about American politics to know if that would aid the situation or just endanger the president of impeachment. The judicial system likely plays a part in saying if an order is legal or no. 

Various scandals like the NSA issue and his general lack of strategy in the Middle East are important, but this has been going on for a good decade now and I think Obama has little real power to stop these things, or to influence strategy to any large degree.

Overall, a lot of his failings as a President are down to the incompetence and impotence of Congress and it's horrific political system that is almost dystopia compared to the UK system. Even our parliament can be shitty and obstructive at times, but this is a whole new level of terrible. If America is to survive without falling into disillusionment and backwardness, Congress needs to get it's act together and work together.

If there was a revolution in the US, the rest of the world would get involved, fast. Depending on the type of uprising, there is a large chance that it would not be a quick affair. It would be brutal, it would be bloody, and the US government could start a global scale war. Here are the top ten issues that came up.

1) The US power grid can be taken down by a series of “surgical strikes” with the exception of the Texas grid. By surgical strikes, I mean a few marksmen (US army-tier Marksmen–the minimum requirement) hitting certain spots on the grid would fuck a lot of the military and government because they need the grid more than Bubba and his friends do. Additionally, while all government agencies have backup generators, they will be hard pressed dealing with the resultant looting and other madness that would come with power outages. This would effectively create another front for the military. It would also turn the people against the government more quickly and paralyze the government’s propaganda machine. Worse still–the key points of the US power grid are publicly obtainable information, and not only are the points too many to be effectively guarded, they are not guarded anyway.

2) The estimated desertion rate in case of a civil war is 75% in the case of a left-wing president. 50% of that would be assumed to immediately betray the president. The remaining (treasonous) military would be fighting its own. Yet another front created in the war. Additionally, there is an assumed 25-50% desertion or outright betrayal rate in three letter government agencies (FBI, CIA, NSA, ATC, TSA, etc.). Additionally, it is assumed that 5% of the initial 50% betrayers would stay in their job and become saboteurs. 10% of that 50% would contain key information that would be of critical danger to the US government. Of that 10%, 1% would be able to deliver that information to the US’ foreign enemies. What you should get from this is that the second the United States government declares war on its own is the second it ceases to exist as the state we know it.

3) “Tea baggers,” “right-wing extremists,” and “oath keepers” which are considered untrained racists who aren’t “good with a gun” often are A) veterans who now have more time to have fun at the range, sometimes more than some Army units or Marine units. In addition to previous military training, B) often camp and do other outdoor activities–more than many in the military do, as the focus has gone away from field exercises, and C) often have better equipment–outside of armor and heavy weapons–than the military. However, C) is kind of irrelevant because many of the places in which these people could hide would make the kind of war the US fights with the equipment they use pointless.

4) Outside influence is a huge problem. Russia has already stated they would back a Texas seperation movement. and right now we already have enough problem keeping Islam in check. The second the US has to fight in a “civil war” is the second it becomes a proxy war between NATO and whoever wants to mess with America. While America has amazing nuclear and air defense, if it comes to a civil war you have to assume that in a best cast scenario the US military is going to be operating at 50% capacity at best. Shit would go down. Hard. And fast. And if Russia–spoiler alert: one of the best militaries in the world at fighting in an urban environment–sent trainers and helpers to rebels, you can reliably bet that they would also possibly deliver weapons to them. So instead of fighting “Timmy TeaBagger,” you are fighting “Timmy TeaBagger who is buddies with Vlad.”

5) A civil war is not just the US versus the rebels. There will be looting. There will be rioting. Cities will burn. The National Guard cannot fight both the rebels and rioters in a city that would also cut off their supplies. Additionally, if you don’t think that the rebels will send in instigators into the cities–or worse, stand alone actors (A Lone Wolf on steroids. Think Timothy McVeigh, but instead of one van they have a whole fleet of them. A good movie example would be Bane)–you would be mistaken. If the US government cannot even help its own people. why would its own people support the remaining (treasonous) military? Worse yet, if someone emptied out prisons (There are more prisoners in the US than there are people in the entire Chinese Army), you would have more crime than the police could ever handle.

6) Logistics and infrastructure in the US are crumbling and failing. Any war fought against a rebellion in the US would be a logistical nightmare, even before the rebels started going full Al-Qaida and putting IEDs in the road. A retired general who was contracting with us on the team said, “The only thing holding together the US’ infrastructure is duct tape and the will of the Department of Transportation. And often enough, there isn't enough duct tape.” Your most loyal cities to the US government, as we polled, are also the most logistically easy to cut off. NYC? San Fran? L.A.? D.C.? Baltimore? Most of them require crossing water to enter, from certain directions. Most of them have critical air ports. Some of them have critical ocean ports. If anything happened to just TWO of the cities on the list, it would create a logistical clusterfuck.

7) Your “Johnny Reb” and “Timmy TeaBagger” states (i.e., “red” states) all have something most of your “oh so progressive,” “Aren’t we so European,” “Oh my god, we are just like Sweden,” blue states don’t. Blues are mainly consumer states. Reds are producer states. Urban areas don’t have farms. The second that shit goes down, realize a lot of those blue areas are likely to starve. In a civil war scenario, we predicted that at least 10,000 people would die of starvation if the war was not finished in a year. The numbers get worse after that.

8) The US has way too many choke points, and the government forces would often be on the wrong side of them. This ties into the logistical nightmare, but it also has to do with an odd phenomena. Liberals like to live near the ocean. Many of the dividers of the country, like the Rocky Mountains, the Mississippi River, Appalachia, the Missouri River (fun fact: the biggest choke point for the US government is in Missouri) are red state areas. Sure, air travel is a thing, but a majority of the US government's needs would have to travel by ground. Even still, many of the major airports are outside of the city. Of course, the US would use military base air fields, but if civil war did break out… which bases would be safe? Which ones would have fallen to the deserters?

9) PR Nightmare. Every rebel killed on CNN would be spun as “the US government killed X Civilians today in a strike” on foreign news and pirate media not owned by the government. That is–as pointed out earlier–if the US media could even function in a civil war or uprising. Your “rebel scum” know that the main thing that holds together the US–nay life in the US as we know it–is the 24 hour news cycle and the media. The second it's gone, you are going to have urban anarchy. If you are from America, can you imagine a day without TV, newspaper, or Internet? Your average urban youth can’t. If you don’t think that isn’t going to cause rioting, you must have a real high regard for how much restraint they have. Assume in a civil war that your ability to talk to the people is compromised. Also assume that in the case of a civil war that rebels may know how to monitor conversations like the US does, as there are manuals online on how to do so.

10) This one is either 1 or 10, depending on who is asked. The US will never nuke its own. The second it does, they have lost the civil war and other countries will come to “liberate” the US from its own “repressive regime.” Additionally, if any general, minuteman, nuke tech, or nuke sub captain decided to side with the rebellion, the US government is immediately SOL.

In short: The second that a “civilian uprising” or “extremist group terrorist attack” turns into “civil war” is the second the US loses. As a result, you will never see a civil war. You will see Waco, you will see Bundy Ranch, you will see all sorts of militant group confrontations and maybe even some skirmishes. But the US government fears its own people way the fuck too much to ever start a civil war.

I don't like to put labels on what I am because what I am and what I think are too broad for a single label. I like certain aspects of capitalism. For me, global healthcare is necessary. I don't think that should even be a discussion. Free healthcare to all, period. People don't choose to get sick. Nor will they demand a leg amputation because it's free.

Basic income makes sense to me. It just does. I think it would allow for a much more productive society.

Now, at work, I believe that people should be paid based on what they actually produce or help to produce. Do you know how many people show up at work, do nothing and demand to get paid as much as those who carry the company?

I think Walmart is an asshole company for paying shit wages. How much fucking money do you need that you have to fuck your employees? A basic income would take care of that. People would not be forced to work for peanuts to eat and feed their children.

I don't know man, too many problems are created by the greed of few that taint the way things should really be like. And things should be easier than they are now.

It costs a lot of money to be poor. A lot. Skip a phone bill, it costs you more money. Miss a payment, it costs you more. Everything is si much more expensive when you don't have the money. And the world just keeps going in that direction. Nothing makes a lot of sense for poor people and the way they are treated by these multi-nationals. It's fuck you all over the place.

False,0,,t5_2tk95,0,0,Barkevious-Mingo,"Ill try to follow your outline.

Originally, you said I was blindly following what WSJ had calculated, and that there was no rhyme or reason behind what the WSJ had written. I pointed out a cited source in the image, which you probably did not see earlier. The lion share of the estimated 18 trillion dollars is ""free"" healthcare. Regardless of the conclusion that Friedman came to, it still costs 15 trillion dollars. That's my issue, so even though you correctly point out the emphasis Fiedman was making in the study, I still have principal issues against the cost.

To your second point, I have no idea what you're talking about, we all engage in political rhetoric every day. Its 1-1 and im hungover so It's easier to fuck with you and be cheeky on the internet rather than line out an argument. You are some random guy and your political ideologies are so ingrained there is no reason in arguing principals. In citing Clement Atlee I had never heard of him, and your point really is falling of deaf ears/eyes. (unless you'd like to explain that one more)

To the third point..Hamiltonian protectionism and interventionism, yes from the colonies till very recently government structure to a free market has lead the way a prosperous economy.....so? Many leading economies have modeled their markets after how the United States regulates theirs...How do you conclude that this is proto-socialism...So any type of government intervention is proto-socialism and is a good reason to implement a form of European socialism here? Is that really your conclusion? That's quite the jump.

Whups misspelled principles..

And lastly my argument against socialism. I dont have the book smarts you obviously do, So I wont be able to go point counter point with you in citing works of scholars and thinkers. Patronize all you want but I am just a normal dude, who didnt go to college and have worked my balls off owning a small business..... My belief against socialism comes from my life experience in business so far and the testimony of my fathers friend  ( who lived in Azerbaijan) for many years under the Communist rule of the Soviet Union.

If B.S. gets elected the US will slowly move toward European socialism, he has said it, he has based his political principles off of it...its gonna happen right?  The Federal government will grow larger and larger, and more and more of my money will be taxed for federal spending. I bust my ass daily to make what I make, and currently I get 28%  percent taken out yearly? Explain to me how going to a more European socialist country will benefit me and my family? I do fear socialism, because for me it has an impact. It has impacted my family. Maybe because you would benefit from more government programs that is why you are seeking this but yeashh no thank you. I value private ownership and individual liberty both of which are limited more so under European socialism than the American Constitution.

False,0,,t5_2t4s3,71,71,NinjaJeebus,"I moved to London a few years ago from the US on a visa as well. Having visited before you're probably alright when it comes to figuring out a lot of the cultural differences, but the change will be that when you visit you're only subject to those differences for a short period. Now you'll have to live with them and confront them. (Longer post because I wish I knew some of this when moving)

* Sunday trading hours (that is the 6 hours larger shops are allowed to be open on Sundays) is relatively annoying if you've forgotten something or have nothing to eat. But there's usually a kebab or pub somewhere nearby.   
* The tourists will begin to annoy you just like everyone else. Embrace this, it will make you a true Londoner (so I am told). You'll want to learn how to do everything and go everywhere in a way that avoids tourists. As a bonus, you can start playing 'Spot the American' on the tube. It's a wonderful game full of stereotypes. 
* Casual racism. Ah, it's nearly an art form. It's not usually meant cruelly or even that badly. It's usually a form of jest, but stems from everyone else not being British (how dare they!). Welcome to also being considered as 'Other - White' as a demographic. Embrace it. 
* Banter. I don't know your experience with British humour at an interactive level - but it doesn't mesh well with American humour unless you have a dry wit. Sarcasm is subtle and you have to realise it on your own. Americans make inflections in their tone to indicate a sarcastic comment, typically. The British (and a lot of Europeans) do not. This can make banter (jocularities amongst friends) a bit hit or miss for a while. Just do your best to listen, engage, and try it out. I realise you said you are quiet...but that may become 'were' with your mates. Also be mindful that banter can, and often does, include a lot of insults. Don't take them personally if you're on good terms with everyone involved. 'Cunt' here is not as bad as it is in the US. It's like a greeting with the right people and in the right tone.  Also be aware that you have to be able to take the jokes as well as give. Self-Deprecating humour is also a staple, so don't be afraid to make fun of yourself at times. But it has to be funny. 
* Culture mixing pot. I'm not sure where in the U.S. you hail from, but London has more cultures than anything you've experienced so far, likely. They all are different, and all have a different way of doing so much. American politeness (assuming you have that) has served me well and it's my default in new situations and I only ever get compliments. 
* Food. Always a contentious topic. As Americans we view the food in England as 'bland'. But not all food. Sunday roast is amazing. Eat it. There are several foods not found in the US that are great. If you like spicy foods, be sure when you get your Indian or Asian food to specify that you like it hot and you mean it.  Don't knock the food in general without trying a lot of it. There are some hidden gems. But it all tastes different. There are less 'additives' in their food than we're used to. I now find US food too much at times. 
* Convenience. Your daily life convenience for finding everything you need at some big-box mega store is now gone. You'll need at least 5 different stores. And that's fine. Most of them will deliver it all to your house on a day and time of your choosing. And consider Amazon Prime - it's massively convenient and they have lockers for pickup all around the city. My typical shopping doesn't involve a store anymore - easier to just order online and have it all delivered on a Sunday afternoon. Including Amazon. 
* History. They have so much more. The culture is so much older and explains a few eccentricities of how things develop. Also explains why they have a thousand and one systems to accomplish what to us only takes one or two. Don't question it too much. You can complain and join in with others complaining about said issues - but don't complain and compare to the U.S. unless asked. You'll be subject to the statements of 'Fine, just go home then.' And don't make world war jokes in Sept-Nov. 



**Apps**. Just to be helpful, make sure you have a few apps to help you along your London way: 

* Citymapper (for getting around) 
* Uber (for getting around via taxi service cheaper than black cab) 
* Laundrapp (deliver-at-home laundry service...useful if your days are long and you have to do dry cleaning/laundry/pressing on a regular basis)  
* Amazon Prime Now (If you have Amazon Prime, this will get you items in about 2-hours from amazon. It truly is amazing and useful) 
* WhatsApp (messaging service, everyone uses it).   
* XE.com (Monetary conversion app) 
* TransferWise (I like this one for transferring money overseas to US accounts, super cheap. Seems secure as well) 
* Fever, YPlan, Dojo (Apps that give you information about events in London...if you like that. There are other apps too, I just stopped bothering) 


So this is far more than you probably wanted. Enjoy. PM me if you have any questions or want to ask anymore.

Each country has it's own stuff which makes it more difficult for a single company (manufacturer, retailer) to reach a certain number of customers which would justify the costs to implement a distribution network like that. Just the customer support of such a company is nightmare because of the language barrier. Only a few companies sell online and even fewer sell to the whole EU or even worldwide.

On the bright side, we have several countries close by with low taxes where products are a lot cheaper. People here go to Andorra where they say you can save around 25%. Bad thing is customs doesn't ""technically"" let you get into your country without paying taxes for what you bought, so you can only cross the border with what you can wear and in the case of motorcycle gear that's complicated.

However, since we Europeans ride whole of a lot more than Americans do, we actually have more options. Partially also because each country has it's own stuff but there's more to choose from here. And searching online for a few popular products, I see it's also cheaper.

When I had to buy my gear I faced the same problem, where to buy it from, and since I'm terribly terribly lazy (I even buy my groceries online), I didn't want to have to go to a physical store.

Also, between ~400AD (the end of Roman rule in Britain) and ~830AD (the hegemony of Wessex established over England) Britain was flooded with invaders and settlers, the Angles, Saxons and Jutes only came to Britain during this time. The Anglo-Saxon states of England only existed for around 400 years maximum. Comparing this 'lack of unification' with other regions of Europe show similar fragmented states (cf. Iberia).

But your question is somewhat leading, it implies that England was an entity which needed to be unified when in fact England as a state exists as a fluke of history, similar to France or Switzerland.

Less critical pieces would see a lot less maintenance, but people aren't going to go ""Oh my, the dollar collapsed. Let's suddenly decide to ignore all the basic services we need to live."" You would just see a major re-shuffling of power, new currencies, and new policies affecting the local economies.

The rest of the world would likely take a decade to adjust to the new balance of power, whatever it happens to be. In the situation we would likely see more dangerous seas, and growing importance of regional military powers. Russia and China would suddenly jump in importance, South America would probably become more active, though the development of Africa might suffer.

It usually didn't play well reddit every time I said the following but anyways:

- In many Europeans countries (In France and in Belgium for instance, where the events took place) we don't consider races. Indeed, from a biological standpoint there's no races in the human species. What you call ""race"" is a social construct that did not remain in all countries. It's absent in France and in Belgium, where the scientific definition of ""race"" still prevails. Yet we still use the word ""racism"" to talk about bigoted views. However, don't ever talk about ""people's races"" in my country or you will sound like a 18th century colonist to us.

So now you can attack entire countries for misusing the word ""racism"" but that would be a little vain. A bit like if I jumped in every conversations in America involving races to yell ""there's no race in the human species anyways"".

False,0,,t5_2qhcv,2,2,MrJMaxted0291,"&gt;comparing share of GDP is a real joke because everywhere other than the West (- Japan) shrunk massively in comparison.

That's the whole point though. The Raj was under the British empire's jurisdiction at the time, yet no serious effort was made to modernise it's industrial capacity because doing so would require an enormous amount of capital investment and would undercut the niche of the factory work that was plentiful in England at the time. India's given role was to provide cheap and plentiful raw materials at bargain bin prices, not to industrialize. It wasn't profitable for them to improve the situation in India rather than exploit it, so they let it languish. 

In many ways, the burden on the Indian public was increased under the British; the salt taxes originally put in place by the East India Company were widely condemned for how severe they were. For example, land rent was doubled at procured saltworks in Calcutta in the mid 1700s by the company and a transit tax was put in place. The profit produced from these exploitative new laws didn't remain in India, it went to the East India company, an international organization whose wealth was tied to financial institutions in Britain, not India. This is just one example of how laws put in place by the British rulers of the time were used to sap wealth from India; through extreme forms of taxation and regulation of the movement of goods, which was another incentive for the rail network, which could turn a windfall on the transit of taxed goods like salt and later cotton. This produced wealth was then handled by nebulous international companies, that moved it around the world, where it would typically eventually settle in investments in the developing industrial nations of western Europe, in the form of estates, private ventures and so on.

It's important to note with your example with China as another power that lost it's position as an economic powerhouse due to a failure to modernise, the rate of wealth loss is [drastically different](https://infogr.am/Share-of-world-GDP-throughout-history), with India's portion of wealth falling at a dramatic rate between 1700 and 1820 compared with China, a period that correlates with the incursions of the British East India company from the mid 1700s when their private army conquered Bengal, an event that triggered the gradual capitulation of India to the British crown. China then only falls behind Europe in the 1870s, a good decade or so after the Raj was established and a great deal of the infrastructure needed to transport mass quantities of goods like cotton exports for the British textile industry was completed. This would suggest that the incorporation of India into Britain's colonial economy hastened their loss of wealth and exacerbated poverty in the region as the revenues generated from harsh taxes and tarriffs were moved out of the country, much in the same way supranational corporations continue to do so today. This is the basis of the argument that enormous wealth was drawn from colonial India while the country's infrastructure was neglected to allow such exploitation to continue.",ukpolitics,cyim9rq,0,,False,t1_cyiiu8g,t3_3yygs0,1451683448,,1454221604

Morocco took a few years to take out, mainly because I was more focused on forming Andalusia as my primary goal of the whole playthrough and wanted to consolidate my position in Iberia. The first war I declared on Portugal after they broke their alliance with Castile, but Castile joined the war midway through before I could take anything from Portugal and pushed me back to the mainland. Ended up with White Peace. Second war I screwed up and was planning on using military access through Aragorn but somehow ended up exiling my armies in Spain and Portugal and literally had to walk them halfway across Europe and Anatolia back to North Africa. Gave up all hope of taking Iberia so I focused on Africa and kept expanding. A few hundred years later in the mid 1700s I saw my chance to take out a vulnerable Portugal and Castile and managed to establish a foothold and began expanding over the course of a few wars. Eventually I managed to secure all the provinces I needed to form Andalusia. At this point I had an army well over 160000, and the only countries that could oppose me were France, Russia and Kebab. The shitty thing is, when I switched to Andalusia, my capital got moved to Iberia and all of my provinces became overseas provinces (75% minimum autonomy) and my force limit got cut down to about 80. I didn't realize this until it was too late. I continued to expand and took out Castile's presence in Western Africa and Iberia, and almost took Portugal out of Western Africa, but I didn't quite make it.

You're not personally liable if fraud results from your decision to use the stripe, though. The banks and retailers are, and they are the ones who set the rules.

&gt;  I'm not allowed the option to use the perfectly functional mag stripe that my card also has on it? 

No, because it's not secure and the plan is to render it not functional in time. The rest of the world has been waiting for the US to do it.

&gt; I also run one of my computers (my beater/travel laptop) without any sort of AntiVirus software, but Lenovo isn't crawling all over my ass forcing me to adopt it.

Lenovo isn't liable if your laptop gets a virus and does something, though. The banks and retailers are liable - especially now that the ""liability shift"" has occured, which is why everyone is pushing chips in the US. You'd presumably want them to cover your losses if your details got stolen and someone went on a spending spree with your card?

&gt; I understand that it's a tested, tried and true technology in the ROW, but it is absolutely a new technology here. Maybe not a revolutionary one, but it's definitely new. Some stores use them, some stores don't, some stores have a card machine with a chip reader in it that isn't activated, can you see where this might frustrate people? 

But the technology was designed by American companies (Visa/Mastercard) and built by American companies (they make the card readers). Some US banks have European and Asian subsidiaries who have been using EMV for ages. Some US retailers are the same (Walmart owns ASDA in the UK, Walgreens owns Boots). The US seems to be trying to reinvent the wheel.

You can worry about the blackheads later, right now just focus on starting up a solid, gentle routine. CeraVe and Aveeno are both drugstore brands. Neutrogena's Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser is good too. You'll want your cleanser to have a pH of around 5.5, not any higher than 6. Too high creates an environment for bacteria to thrive. Bar soap is bad for this reason- bar soaps are made in such a way that they have high pH levels. TTO is good for acne if it's diluted in a carrier oil like mineral oil. If you want to use it feel free, but make sure you dilute it to at least 5% to start off (1:20).

You probably aren't using enough BB cream to get the full effects of the SPF; you need 1/4 tsp. Try a dedicated sunscreen underneath your makeup. There are a lot of cosmetically elegant sunscreens from Asia and Europe, and a few good American brands as well like EltaMD.

If a product is making your face feel taut or dry, it's probably drying you out, which is bad because again this helps create a good environment for bacteria, which leads to more acne. If you really want to use a toner, a lot of people here like Thayer's Alcohol-Free Witch Hazel, or you can use something more hydrating like Hada Labo's Gokujyun Lotion. A toner isn't really necessary though- cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF are more important.

Vaseline won't clog your pores, and don't worry it's not a stupid question. The molecules of petrolatum are too big to penetrate your pores, so they're not able to clog them. It just sits on your face and creates a barrier that keeps moisture from escaping. I prefer Aquaphor because it has more beneficial ingredients but YMMV.

If you add in any new products, make sure that you add them in very slowly- two weeks before each new product is added. If something starts making your skin worse, stop using it and return it. Save your receipts for easy returns. Don't buy a ton of things at once because it's too tempting to try them all at once.

Some things the tpd adds:

1. No tanks above 2ml capacity
2. No bottles above 10ml with 20mg/ml limit
3. Only ecigarettes that are 100% leak free will be available. This means none of our famous tanks will be purchaseable legally after this date
4. Leak free refilling. They have two options they are considering. Either bottles with 20 drops per MINUTE or bottles/tank devices that must be connected to the device to refill (meaning only cigalikes)
5. No purchases cross border will be legal. Only within country borders. Meaning no more molinshop except for polish customers
6. All products has to be tested of every flavor and every nicotine strength of said flavor. This will cost tons, maybe 10k euros for f.ex ""lambada 6mg"" and another for the same flavor in 3mg, and etc. Most companies will not be able to afford this. If they do, the liquid selection will be really low. Only big companies can afford this, this means tobacco companies will take most of the market. And who knows what they put in the liquid... and every liquid has to be tested at every store who sells it, even though it has already been tested!
7. No advertising at all.

False,0,,t5_2svvy,1,1,madscientistEE,"I like working on it and it gives an opportunity to get a lot of well built power at very reasonable prices if one is careful with their selections and knowledgeable enough to bring said selections back into spec. If you venture into vintage without some repair skills, expect to either settle for mediocre performance and reliability, swap gear until you get some that works properly or pay someone to restore a unit for you. This hobby can be cheap if you're willing and knowledgeable enough to get a little dirty. If you want turnkey performance, be prepared to shell out quite a bit of cash. 

Speakers... For every wonderful classic Klipsch, JBL, Polk or ADS, there are a thousand rubbish vintage speakers that aren't worth picking up from the curb. The exceptions however can be quite lovely, as many of us will attest to. Some classics, like old Altecs can fetch thousands. The CD era produced some very good speakers designed to show off the strengths of the format, many of which are old enough to be considered vintage but still use modern materials and construction methods. These can be absolutely fantastic but don't pay too much for them because for not much more than the ""top dollar"" prices, you can get a new speaker in kit form that will decidedly outperform them. I love my ADS-L500s but I have a design I built 10 years ago that is definitely superior and the cost to build them was only ~$250. Look for bargains or buy new basically. 

Vintage sources, other than tuners and turntables, are hell to get working perfectly with little reward. Yes, I'm talking about tape machines, both cassette and RTR. Belts are the least of your troubles here. Worn and virtually irreplaceable mechanical parts like rollers and heads may await those willing to adventure into tape and you'll go through all this work knowing that your laptop can make a higher quality recording. It's purely a nostalgia or legacy media preservation purchase, IMHO. I'm going to rebuild my Technics RS-M228X but only because it looks cool and because sometimes people want to convert their cassettes to digital formats and I need something to get the tape into the computer with.

80s CD players are another nostalgia only item. The 90s-new units have better DACs, lower noise analog circuitry and more reliable optical assemblies. Plus, it's unlikely you'll find one in silver to match your 70s to early 80s stuff anyway. (Heck, you'll have an easier time finding a *new* CD player in silver!)

Turntables... There are few modern turntables worthy of your consideration. Most of the good ones are vastly overpriced units for customers with more money than sense. Technics made the SL-1200 until 2011 and Onkyo is currently producing a direct drive unit called the CP-1050; these are some of the few modern tables worthy of your consideration. In most cases, you'll get higher performance and or more value for your money by getting a good direct drive from the 70s-80s. Maintenance is generally simple on these thanks to very high quality mechanical parts that wear very slowly. Pick a good cartridge and stylus and lube per the manufacturer's instructions and you'll be treated to very solid performance for decades with little maintenance required. (Older DD units may be getting to the point of needing capacitor replacement.) 

Tuners... Assuming you don't need digital reception (HD Radio in the US, DAB and DRM in EU), a vintage tuner is a fantastic idea. Currently there are two types of modern tuners for sale: Those that are kinda pricey and provide OK but not stellar performance and those that are awesome and super expensive. A good vintage tuner, assuming it's in alignment, is a fantastic way to enjoy radio. Alignment issues are a deal breaker unless you have a shop that can perform them and you're willing to pay the alignment fee. (usually around $75-100 as the shop has to recoup the cost of the expensive alignment gear somehow!) AM performance in particular has been neglected on many modern designs so if you have good AM programming that you'd like to hear more clearly, a good antenna along with an older tuner in good working order may be exactly what you need. While it won't deliver the clarity and detail of FM, AM doesn't have to sound awful! 

Surround sound processors, A/V control amps and A/V receivers... Modern only unless you have an old TV or don't need the video features at all. A modern surround sound processor will not only decode old analog formats but will also decode newer formats and will give you the modern connectivity you need to hook up modern sources. 

Amplifiers and Receivers... Excellent values exist here, especially if you can refurbish them yourself. Any quality brand vintage amp in good condition will make rated power with instantaneous reserves to spare. Gutless wonders weren't nearly as prevalent back in the days when the FTC actually enforced rules on power amplifier ratings. Watch the noise specs though, particularly if you enjoy digital recordings. Some of these old amps aren't the quietest designs. 

So that's my thought on the state of vintage vs. modern...so where does that put my system? Well I have three.

False,0,,t5_2cneq,2,2,yea_about_that,"&gt;He completely reversed course from what Bush was doing. Got us out of Iraq and Afghanistan. 

It is not correct to say he reversed course:

&gt;...in 2008 George W. Bush signed the U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement. It included a deadline of 31 December 2011, before which ""all the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory"".[11][12][13] The last U.S. troops left Iraq on 18 December 2011, in accordance with this agreement.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_U.S._troops_from_Iraq

He removed troops from Iraq EXACTLY the same time as Bush planned to remove troops.  To say he ""reversed course"" is simply wrong.

He increased troops in Afganistan once he became president and after 8 years we still have troops in Afganistan.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_U.S._troops_from_Afghanistan

&gt; targeted drone strikes.

Bush started the drone strikes and Obama has continued the policy.  Obama has ordered an order of magnitude more drone strikes than Bush and some estimates are that 90% of the drone strikes involve innocents and 2,500 people have been killed by them.
https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2015/02/02/almost-2500-killed-covert-us-drone-strikes-obama-inauguration/

http://www.globalresearch.ca/obama-ordered-ten-times-more-drone-strikes-than-bush/5475415

&gt;Shifted the focus from American centric to American led coalition.

Not really.  For example, the vast majority of the troops in Afganistan are US troops.  Nobody wants to put their troops in danger if they can get someone else to do it.

&gt;Diplomacy with Iran over isolation.

Again, this was essentially a continuation of Bush foreign policy:

&gt;...Nine years ago, President George W. Bush agreed to join Europeans at the negotiating table with Iran. At the time, the conditions were that Iran must suspend uranium activities for talks to engage about halting its nuclear program in exchange for economic and political benefits.
“It’s conceptually a deep irony because this diplomatic outreach was originally designed and engineered by President Bush,” said Philip Zelikow, a University of Virginia professor who was a deputy to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in Mr. Bush’s administration. “It’s convenient for Republicans and Democrats to forget this.”

In some parts of South America and particularly in Mexico (as well as Russia) cops don't have much patience but again, you are not generally at risk of being shot or beaten or tased for just being a drunken oaf and being guilty of having too much fun or running your mouth.

So if you take all of these pathogens together and spread them at once to a previously non-affected population, mayhem doesn't seem out of the question to me. Not as in everybody dying, but as in half the population dying or something like that.

If you're doing that intentionally, sure. Someone actively infected with Influenza or with a wet Shingles rash could probably do a lot of damage to primeval *Homo sapiens*.

However, if you're feeling healthy with no sick contacts within 2 weeks of time travel, I don't think there's any danger though. We generally stop shedding virus within a few weeks of symptom resolution.

Our bacterial flora, to which OP referred, would probably be tolerated just fine. They are generally kept in check by our innate immunity rather than the specific immune response, and aren't pathologic at baseline. Skin is even less likely to have changed in a big way.

100,000 years from now, encountering a new virus or bacteria would give you the same mortality rate *as an individual* that an age-matched control of that population, unless you are missing a very specialized gene or something. (Black Plague comes to mind; there is a hypothesized mutation that would explain why Europeans no longer get *Yersinia pestis* infections, but that could easily be a public health thing rather than a genetic thing.)

Now, if a *population* of time travelers went far into the future and stayed very close together with intermittent exposure to future humans, things might go south very quickly.

Quand tu commences à t'inscrire à des systèmes de protections de droits d'auteur, t'as des contraintes débiles et tu te fais baiser. Le fait d'attendre 70 ans avant de mettre l’œuvre d'un défunt dans le domaine publique est complètement absurde, et Disney fait la loi à ce niveau là ce qui est inadmissible. La possibilité de pouvoir vendre ses droits, ou de pouvoir récupérer des droits sur quelque chose qui était clairement domaine publique (à la happy birthday) pose aussi quantité de problème. Aussi le fait qu'on ait pas (à ma connaissance) un équivalent du fair use en France est ridicule.
Je les ignorais pas, mais on parle du concept, pas de l'execution (qui je suis d'accord laisse à désirer).

Encore une fois une vision clairement pas informée premièrement de l'histoire des artistes, et deuxièmement du fait que le contexte économique a changé depuis les temps anciens. Premièrement, les deux couches sociales ont toujours existé. Il y a certes toujours eu des amuseurs publiques, ton exemple se référant probablement aux ménestrels (d'ailleurs dire à""à la base un artiste"" et utiliser l'exemple d'un type d'artiste qui n'existe que depuis le XIIe siècle c'est assez drôle...), mais il y a toujours eu en parallèle des gens qui travaillaient pour l'aristocratie. Et si tu veux prendre des exemple qui sont plus vieux d'un peu moins de 1700 ans, les grecs avaient déja un système autour de l'art extrêmement organisé. Donc l'argument est juste complètement invalide.
Quand bien même, imaginons que l'argument de tradition (qui est déjà en soi un mauvais argument) basé sur des faits tout simplement faux soit valide. Un film ça coûte des millions à faire, qui est-ce qui va te donner des millions pour faire un truc qui fera aucun profit ? Ou est-ce que les investisseurs auront le droit de faire du profit sur les ventes de tickets mais les artistes peuvent se brosser ? C'est quoi le système alternatif que tu proposes ? 

Quant au deuxième point. J'avouerais que je vois pas en quoi le type connu pour être mort de fatigue à 34 balais parce qu'il arrivait justement pas à combiner le train de vie que son status lui imposait avec une activité prodigue de compositeur t'aide à prouver quoi que ce soit.

Mozart c'était une star, il avait une super carrière de compositeur, mais il faisait pas d'argent dessus parce qu'il n'y avait pas vraiment de lois de droits d'auteur à l'époque.

However, as the Tal'Darim in SC2 show, there are much better ways to approach that; the rule of two is ""subsist and hide"", not ""be strong and rule"".  If it wasn't so ingrained into the mythos and cool-sounding, it would be a passing fad.   

From a more meta perspective, Revan wouldn't have been written as creating it if it hadn't already been established over the EU's mythos, so downplaying the rule of two hardly downplays Revan, who was incredible, and just given credit for that rule because Revan is awesome, and they wanted him to have historical significance to the Sith in a story where he had to canonically return to the light. 

I don't think that Revan is unimportant, or a terrible Sith.  I think he was alright as a Sith.  But everything that makes him truly incredible, indelible, and special, is what he did AFTER, when he was neither.

2012 remake of the Sid Meier game in which you defend the Earth from an alien invasion with a squad of Elite soldiers in turn based strategic tactical missions.  Highly recommend if you haven't played it before.

All Major Grand Theft Auto games from the PS2 and PS3 Era.

**Metro Redux Bundle** $7.49

Two really good fps games with nice HD graphics. 

**Crusader Kings 2** $9.99

One of my favorite games but it is not everyone's cup of tea.  A grand strategy game in which you try to build up your family dynasty to be a major power in medieval Europe. You either totally hate it or spend too much time plotting to kill your wife, so that you can marry a courtier with the genius trait to pass on to your heir. 

**Mass Effect Collection** (Mass Effect 1+2) $8.74

Technically a RPG but it feels more like an action game than an RPG. The game is usually cheaper on Origin ($5
 for the Trilogy including Mass effect 3) but Mass Effect 2 was that good of a game that I felt it should be included.

**FTL: Faster Than Light** $3.99

Cute little Roguelike spaceship simulation game with pixel graphics in which you need to out run the enemy fleet while trying to upgrade your ship so that you can defeat the enemy battleship at the end.

**Sid Meier's Pirates!**  $2.49

OK it is a game from 2005 and the engine wasn't designed for widescreen displays but this game is pure casual fun being a pirate in the Spanish Main.

##What do you like to talk about?

I love Disney movies, Buzzfeed, politics, books and just generally hearing about your day! You should be interested in chatting equally about the mundane day-to-day parts of life as well as the exciting and sexy. I love animals and would be happy to see pictures of your pets! 


##GFE Questions

Please answer these to the best of your ability and send them in a private message to /u/memoriepatton. The subject of your email should be your Reddit username.

What time zone are you in? (I am in Central, -6gmt. Usually European time zones and Australian time zones conflict with my time zone, if you are in these time zones you purchase at your own risk, I do not do refunds based on timezone conflicts. The light usually works best for these time zones.)

What are you hoping for a GFE type experience?

What kind of photos would you really love to see?

What kind of videos would you really love to see?(KIK videos are about 15 seconds long).

Are there any times you are not able to chat besides when you are sleeping?

What is your typical sleeping pattern? 

Are there any fetishes you have you'd like me to indulge in?

Are you okay with the 3-4 block of time per day where I will be unavailable to chat?

Are you able to receive NSFW photos at work? Are there any times you are not able to get photos?

If you are interested in the heavy package, what would you be interested in for your additional service?

What method of payment would you be most comfortable using? I currently prefer to accept Amazon Giftcards and Bitcoin, but we can discuss other options.

This means the majority of players are Americans, Canadians, and Mexicans in that order. The league draft is currently only American colleges and therefore you'll be seeing the highest percentage of players being American. 

Outside of North America, there is an Australian contingent because the NWSL season takes place in the W-League's off-season and vice versa. The next areas with multiple players are the British Isles and Brazil, each with a handful of players.

False,0,,t5_38gfm,3,3,DanglyW,"&gt;and who do you think is forcing this opression? Do you think it has fallen from the sky? NO. Some people are effectively doing this opression which is highly supported by its (mostly male) citizens. Was there ever a pro-LGBT march in some middle eastern country? Dude even in eastern europe they got beaten up a decade ago, what do you think would happen in a much much more radical ideology?

I really really urge you to read up on the Arab Spring. Like, really, because it sounds like your impression of the Middle East is based entirely on Fox News promo vids.

&gt;you cannot compare neighbors with 3rd world immigration which has a much different culture 

I most certainly can - my Chinese neighbors barely speak English. I don't think 'much different culture' is a problem, or a bad thing. One of my childhood friends is a Dominican dude - I don't think his culture was my culture, but that didn't stop us from being friends.

&gt;Germany will spend about 20 billion euros on immigrants in 2016 while Sweden took a loan of 9 billion euros for immigration, since it's a loan it will have an interest rate which means that swedish taxpayers will have to repay it.

Just read the Wiki I linked. There is enormous evidence that immigration has a net positive outcome on economies. Germany for example enjoys a lot of cheap labor from those immigrants. You brought up Japan - out of curiosity, are you aware that most of Japans workforce is immigrants that serve the growing population of elderly that need constant care?

&gt;Do you know how economy functions? If any country suddenly started giving out money to it's citizens it's GDP would grow. Sweden had a 4.6% growth this year, partially because it simply gave money to immigrants, guess what, this could've been done if they gave out money to it's citizens 

Do you understand what taxes are? Or how cheap labor pools contribute to a country? 

&gt;Only like 95% of them lol

Dude, seriously, you need to educate yourself. I'm not saying this to make fun of you or be combative, but your presumption that 'only like 95%' of immigrants are devout and religious Muslims is factually wrong.

&gt;First of all, I love how everyone think that Christianity is Europe's version of Islam. It isn't. Islam is much more radical. Do I regard it as dangerous? Yes, but not to the same extent as Islam. I don't know much about judaism and hinduism (my mistake) so I won't talk out of my ass in subject I'm not good at - but it's not a problem since, with the exception of the UK, indians are moving that much to europe.

Are you serious? Christianity has an entire country dedicated solely to it's management. Christianity is pervasive, exploitative, and subjugates it's followers under ignorance and fear. Islam and Christianity are so damn similar they've been warring with each other for more than a thousand years - you think Christianity is the good guy here? Or that places with more Christianity aren't *also* more ignorant and extreme and suppress women, homosexuals, or free thinking? How's Italy's science program doing? What about it's birth rate or literacy?

Have you ever heard of the 'brain drain'? It's a phenomenon wherein Chinese and Indian students are coming to America to get educated, and then leaving back to their home countries, and for a while was viewed as a problem in academia until it was realized that many of them were trying to stay in America, and also, they're hard working and cheap to train, so form a significant part of the backbone of the industry. This notion of 'only Muslims are immigrating' is so far from the mark I'm just going to tell you again to read more.

&gt;I wish Chinese moved to europe instead of muslims.

I'd like to point out that many people in /r/European don't agree with you. And, hilariously, I have to point out that 'China Town' is a thing in almost every major city in America, and can be described as 'a part of a city where people don't assimilate, don't learn the language of the country they're in, and continue practicing their home culture'. Why is it ok for the Chinese to do it in your mind, but not Muslims?

Because you're racist against Muslims.

EU is falling apart politically and EURO was at the edge 2015 with the greek crisis. The next country to go bust is at the doorsteps: maybe italy, spain, portugal, france or finland. there will be one candidate and that is much harder to fix than little greece. portugal just bailed its 2nd biggest bank. and even smaller local banks are now systemic as a bust can collapse the whole sector like a domino.

And US is still in the different wars, adding debt. 2008 was an appetizer and was fixed a la minute with 3 trillion usd taxpayer money. but now debt has multiplied and credits can be payed. The banking is now global and a single bank collapse in one bigger country can trigger a whole industry wipe out as all are basically bankrupt and dont have hard edged collateral.

in summary we'll have a crisis in commodity market, in industrial overcapacities, big companies cant pay back their credits and that will lead to above described domino in the banking sector and a proper feedback loop of debt and now with china landing it's only getting worse. and what the ""elites"" answer to crisis?

False,0,us,t5_2qhvo,4,4,tayaravaknin,"&gt; For example, if you read the diaries of the early Zionist writers and settlers they call for the expulsion of the natives (Palestinians) and the colonization of Palestine by European Jews

They call for Jews to be able to return to their historic homeland. Some call for encouraging the leaving of Palestinians (who are natives **like the Jews**, not ""instead of"" Jews), but they do not encourage it be done forcibly. For example, while Herzl wrote that, ""We shall have to spirit the penniless population (the Arabs) across the border...while denying it any employment in our country"", this quote is truncated in such a way that it changes the meaning. What Herzl actually said is:

&gt;When we occupy the land, we shall bring immediate benefits to the state that receives us. We must expropriate gently the private property on the estates assigned to us. We shall try to spirit the penniless population across the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while denying it any employment in our country. The property owners will come over to our side. Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discretely and circumspectly...It goes without saying that we shall respectfully tolerate persons of other faiths and protect their property, their honor, and their freedom with the harshest means of coercion. This is another area in which we shall set the entire world a wonderful example … Should there be many such immovable owners in individual areas [who would not sell their property to us], we shall simply leave them there and develop our commerce in the direction of other areas which belong to us.

With context, this quote shows that Herzl sought not to expel, but to encourage and find employment for Palestinian Arabs in other countries. It also shows that any who did not want to sell their land in exchange for better opportunities elsewhere would have all their rights respected and be left alone, if necessary.

&gt; Today Israel is identified as a state but it has never actually been one. It has no borders, no constitution, no recognized capital, and its Supreme Court has ruled that there is no such thing as an Israeli people.

It has undefined borders, true, as a result of a border dispute. So do many other countries. There are over 200 border disputes in the world. That does not make every state nonexistent. It does not have a constitution, but neither do many other countries. In the meantime, its Basic Laws function as a Constitution. Many could point to the United Kingdom, for example, as having no Constitution. Does that make it not-a-state?

And the Supreme Court has not ruled that there is no ""Israeli people"". The court ruled that there is no [Israeli **ethnicity**](http://www.timesofisrael.com/supreme-court-rules-israeli-ethnicity-doesnt-exist/), but an ethnicity is not the same thing as a ""people"". New Zealanders are not an ethnic group, but they are a people. They are a nation. Not all nations are ethnically based.

So you clearly don't understand what constitutes a state if you don't think Israel is one.

&gt; This is preciously the root of the problem in Israel/Palestine. There has never been in human history a colonial project that did not face resistance from the people it was destroying/dispossessing.

Israel is not a colonial project, though attacking natives returning from diaspora being construed as ""colonialists"" in the same vein as the French or British is an Arab propaganda victory that built on Palestinian xenophobia to the pan-Arab advantage.

&gt; If the project had started earlier Israel would have destroyed the Palestinians and probably become a normal state like the US/Canada/Australia but it started too late and it cannot openly commit genocide or wide scale ethnic cleansing without encountering the world's wrath

Leaders come and go in Canada &amp; Mexico and there is never talk of invasion.  Canada and Mexico conduct trade with whomever they want.  Based on closeness we are a major trading partner with both but we are hardly their only trading partner.  

The bottom line is Russia is trying to pretend that it is still at the center of the USSR &amp; Warsaw Pact but that is nonsense.  When countries left those organizations Russia lost any special rights or authority that they ever had.  They are all just sovereign nations.  Russia has no special rights regardless of its opinion on any topic.  By invading and occupying and treating its neighbors badly it is forcing them to make a choice and most will choose to move closer to the West.  As for what what Russia said in 2008 that was just a threat.  Threatening your neighbor does not create special rights for you.  The bottom line is Russia is driving Eastern Europe towards the West.

Porto and Lisbon have the world's best hotels (literally, Google it) so you will have great choices and ridiculous prices. Also the staff are helpful, kind and knowledgeable (er, I would know, I was one for 4 years). Check a guide or tripadvisor for the top things to do but make sure to go to the Real Companhia Velha wine cellars. Don't go inside the ones by the river beautiful as they are), instead walk out a bit into the RCA. When there, *make sure* to ask to see the ""Frascaria"". If they say no (it's not open to the public) beg. Tell them you will be careful and that you travelled all the way from Canada and that you were specifically recommended that Cellar and the Frascaria. 

Travel from Porto to Lisbon: train, bus or ride sharing. Neither is too expensive or complicated, so I trust you will succeed. 

Stay in Lisbon: another 4 days. Again stay in a hostel, I believe the current number 1 is in Lisbon but the 2016 awards should be coming up (keep an eye out in hostelworld.com). Again check a guide or tripadvisor for things to do, I will just leave a couple of less known tips:

* Free tours are awesome, enjoy them
* Taberna Portuguesa is a nice place to go and Eat. Ask for Fernando, tell them I sent you and ask for the house digestif in the end. Go easy with it, it's stronger than it tastes.
* If you are interested in Fado, Bela is my favorite place. Be there at 20.30. Be sure to stay quiet during the performance. Quiet doesn't mean whispering, it doesn't mean texting, it doesn't mean filming. It means **quiet**. They are quite traditional about such things. They will offer you the sangria, but the fact is their whole wine selection is no good, you will be better off with a ginjinha in this particular place.

Sintra: since you have spare days, I would actually book an airbnb in Sintra for 1 night. From Sintra you can go to Cascais, Estoril and Cabo da Roca by bus (ask you airbnb host). There is a lot to see in Sintra, certainly enough for a very busy day. Then you can return by train from Estoril.

Cascais: One cool thing to do which is near the ocean but does not require swimming is to walk along the ""Paredão"" (""Boardwalk"") which connects Cascais to Estoril along the ocean. It's pretty and it will get you a few nice pictures along the way. Another alternative for Ocean related activities is below.

Estoril: Europe's biggest casino (or biggest slot room?) is in Estoril. I personally don't like it, but I thought I could mention it. What *is* more up my alley is the small hip pizzaria ""Don Formaggio, just across the Casino gardens. Perfect place if you er find company along the trip.

Beach: if you can't swim DON'T FUCKING TRY. Seriously you will be underwater in 10 seconds and dead in 60. Don't try to dip you feet, don't play games with the sea. Seriously the Atlantic does not fuck around, a wave can come out of nowhere and ruin your shit - permanently. *That said*, the ocean is a beautiful place so I do recommend you Cabo da Roca. It's a beautiful precipitous cliff with a never ending view over the ocean. Def check that out (I took 4 Canadian girls there who had never seen the ocean - 2 of them cried). 

Football: unfortunately you will only know the exact match date and time max 15 days in advance. So prepare to be flexible. Also, depending on the teams standings at that point one game or another may be more interesting. Check back later with us and we will advise you :)

NTSC was originally developed in the United States. Europeans trying to move to color television found that NTSC didn't work as well due to geography and a difference in electricity standards. So they developed two new protocols. Germany invented PAL and shared it with Europe, while France invented SÉCAM as a point of national pride. 

Politics entered in and determined who adopted what standard. American-influenced countries like Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and parts of the Americas adopted the American NTSC standard. Former French colonies adopted the SÉCAM standard. Because most of Europe went with PAL, the Soviet world went with SÉCAM to prevent their citizens from receiving Western broadcasts. 

None of the standards are compatible with another because they transmit different things. NTSC transmits 525 scan lines of data whereas PAL and SÉCAM transmit 625 scan lines of data. PAL and SÉCAM transmit color and audio differently, so a TV set in one standard will receive a black-and-white picture with no sound from the other standard's broadcast.

These differences persisted into digital television. The US upgraded to ATSC. PAL and SÉCAM merged into DVB. Japan invented ISDB, and shared it with Brazil. And China is developing yet another standard, DTMB. So not all digital TV is the same.

Region locking, though, is completely made up because nowadays the device (video player, game console) is what converts the data from the disc to a video format the television will understand.

""I played on Kronos, I had a 60 rogue with close to pre-raid BiS at the time before quitting due to population not allowing for BGs. As of now I have a 60 rogue with full pre-raid BiS and a few MC items on the Nostalrius PvE server. Sitting on 3/8 NS with t2 helmet and in the strongest guild Horde side (Deja Vu) atm. Here are a list of the notable differences:

Kronos scripting once upon a time was superior because they pushed a finalized product and even took a month in closed beta to iron out all kinks. Nostalrius I did not play on launch but I heard the typical things you heard on Kronos about Nostalrius, no scripting, it's all buggy etc. For the first month after Kronos launched it was an endless mudsling fight vs the two servers and their communities.

Playing on Nostalrius PvE atm and it's relatively solid. It beats in population, to test this point I played the servers Monday morning at 6:00 central. So roughly about noonish server times. NOW it's also important to note this is shortly following the ""dead hours"" of Nostalrius PvE where it's too late for NA players, too early for European players. Nostalrius PvE was in the 1300s, Kronos had 136. As of right now, 3:41 central (am if you don't use military time/24 hour time) 1130 players on which is dead by this server's standards. We call this ""Above average peak"" on Kronos. To further illustrate the point I remember a thread of the dude from Stormlords on Kronos where he took players during peak hours over all of November. Your average peak for November was like 752. We have above that when our server is dead, that is your peak.

When it comes to scripting, I can't argue anything here. Kronos had solid scripting I will admit except for the video I remember seeing on Arcanum's Onyxia where it was under the floor. Might have been Insidious. Nostalrius had the Grizzly video for Rag we all know of him bugging and not doing anything for the kill. Does that mean it's the case still? No, Nostalrius PvE scripting is really solid, I'd even go as far as to say it's better than Kronos scripting as of now. Also for as much hell as Kronos gave Nost over BWL crashes, I'm told the same is happening in ZG for Kronos.

No, here's the big reason of why Nostalrius is better: They actively gated gearing up. On Kronos bosses had full loot tables and reworked stats, it was basically starting again in 1.12. My rogue had the core hound tooth and I only played Kronos for about two months so I can say this is fact. Nostalrius on the other hand has the pre-reworked stats so my Bloodfang Helmet is actually inferior to Mask of the Unforgiven until either March or May whenever stat reworks happen. This means since I am actively wanting to go daggers, I can't make that spec work fully until that time when Aged Core Leather Gauntlets can drop in MC. Alternatively we have DM on the horizon. Also that's another thing, Kronos had DM in on launch so you had that and all the crazy gear that comes from that place. Meanwhile our mages don't even have 55 water yet IIRC. So when it comes to gear, Kronos has the full loot table and reworked stats in so the content is made a lot easier by that token. Fortunately when it comes on Nostalrius PvE, no reason any guild that isn't made in that week shouldn't have MC clear. To my knowledge only one guild on Nostalrius PvE doesn't have MC clear and they're fairly new.
During the leveling up phase I had more bugged quests on Kronos than I did on Nostalrius but I refuse to use that as an argument as I did them on one server far later than the other. However Kronos had the Proudtusk quest in Blasted Lands to find his wife on the mountain bugged (her ghost wouldn't show) and the moonsaber quest in Felwood were bugged. I had zero bugged quests leveling up on Nostalrius PvE and the only bugged thing were escorts mongoloiding because some dude 300 yards away was hitting a rat.

I have nothing against Kronos or its community, however Nostalrius for all intents and purposes is the better server. The only issue would be lag from the pvp server but with as many players as they have it's expected.
I fully suggest anyone who wants the best odds to play, play the Nostalrius PvE server as it doesn't have the pvp server lag and far more players and equal if not better scripting to Kronos.""",wowservers,cyj7kkc,0,,False,t3_3z0jrn,t3_3z0jrn,1451733669,,1454231852

For example, many of the African languages belong to the Niger-Congo major family; so Swahili can be traced through Niger-Congo &gt; Bantu &gt; Swahili. Swahili and English, therefore, belong to different families.

3. Some families are debated because it is unclear whether they share a common ancestor with other languages, e.g. Basque. I don't think there is consensus on how many languages you can have in an ""isolate group"". For example, suppose that there are several varieties of Basque, I believe that they all would still count as language isolates.

4. The most common characteristics used to compare families are lexical and morphosyntactic properties. For example, you can compare kinship terms across the Indo-European languages (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_vocabulary). As for morphosyntax, many African languages use an extensive noun class system, whereas Indo-European tends to use only a two/three-way grammatical gender system.",linguistics,cyj7ncz,0,,False,t3_3z4n9d,t3_3z4n9d,1451734017,,1454231890

My problem is that I feel his idea of the club showing ambition will be to let him actually improve the team for once. It's fine declaring we want Europe, but unless we actually improve a team that has generally (for me) looked ""OK"" at best since last January, we're never going to get close to Europe again.  

But the club don't go out and buy players that can do that, or bring through youths that can develop into good players (which has previously funded other transfers in itself). In the long term, the only player we have bought that has been an improvement on an existing or departing player (since our first PL season), for me, is Forster. Maybe Wanyama too, but I always had a thing for Corky. Mané is good as well, but he didn't really replace anyone directly, and has been inconsistent anyway.  

I think that if we're just going to buy mediocre players we should promote youth instead, because at worst they'll likely be mediocre/bad (Martina), and at best we'll get a Shaw, Chambers, Lallana. If Koeman won't give the youth a chance because he doesn't think they're good enough, then we need to address that, but that means the ambition has to come from transfers, and not just intentions.",SaintsFC,cyj7vkp,0,,1451735341,t1_cyj6xfb,t3_3z4i2s,1451735071,,1454231997

These days, I only visit for a few days at a time (must have been to Budapest around 15 times total) and I've seen tourism increase noticeably in that time. In fact much of the inner city has had EU money renovating roads and pathways to improve quality so Budapest has a much nicer city centre and river front area even compared to 2010.

False,0,SWED,t5_2u7i2,2,2,HaltRedditCensorship,"I am fundamentally against the idea of democracy. I believe in a bill of rights: a constitution, that guarantees certain rights to the people, and it should be regarded of as a document that cannot be infringed in any way. The vast majority of people in Europe are uneducated plebs that don't know what is best for them. It was democracy that fucked my country up to the point where thought crimes are now illegal. How did this happen? The media (state funded) made a major push in the 90s for hate speech laws by pulling at the heart strings of the common folks. Democracy means the unwashed masses can freely infringe on my fundamental rights. The only area in which democracy can work is on the local level, in matters that hardly matter. In a nation there should exist no means by which to alter the constitution. 

I think you overlook the significant cultural and racial differences between the people of Europe. We are not compatible with each other. I have spoken to several Romanians and other eastern Europeans, and they all seem in favor of a very totalitarian state which goes against the values of old of the west, independence, freedom and self sufficiency. We don't have this anymore, but I would say we still yearn for it at some base level, whilst eastern Europeans seem more comfortable with the idea of a totalitarian regime/nanny state.

And you have yet to give me any example of something ongoing as you say.

&gt; No they don't. The only people who have a right to Palestine is its inhabitants, the people who cannot trace their family or physical history outside it, ie the native people there. These include Palestinian Jewish natives and Arab natives, but not ""the"" Jewish people as a whole (ie: people around the world who identify as Jewish, be it from China or India or Europe).

[The Jewish people have origins in Israel (the Middle East) the same way Palestinians do.](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/1.681385)
And thus, they can also be considered natives and your argument is obsolete.

&gt; You keep saying the Arabs refused 1948 as if it is a bad thing, the indiginous people living in Palestine who made up more than 70% of the population, did not want to divide their country and their people in two states, because people from Europe wanted a country for themselves in Palestine.

The modern world is a democracy, and again, these ""people from Europe"" you are talking about are people who have ancestors that lived in Israel thousands of years ago.

&gt; False, I abhor all crimes against humanity and all forms of racism, you unfortunately do not, clearly you believe that we should close our eyes when Jews commit crimes because we must be sensitive to Jewish suffering, this is a shameful position to hold, particularly for a Jew.

Wow, thanks for calling me someone who does not oppose crimes against humanity and call me shameful, also for my religion. What an attempt to belittle someone when you are losing an argument.

&gt; You can call me an antisemite all you want, I do not care about your race or religion

Yet you have mentioned the fact that I am Jewish **several** times.

&gt; and you sir are an advocate of war crimes and a believer in racism/discrimination when done by Jews against Arabs.

Nice generalization... By giving one example I didn't oppose to suddenly I'm an advocate of war crimes and a believer in racism/discrimination against Arabs.

How wonderful.

**What have you enjoyed?** The first RPL qualifier tournament was one of my best RL experiences ever (as a player) fighting our way to the top 8 and trying to get as good seeding as possible for the next tournament was really thrilling. Playing with the best teams in EU the week after was a great bonus. 

**What can we work on?** I've been following eSports since Starcraft 2 started growing and before LoL was big. What I'm really missing for Rocket League is a site like this: [Leaguepedia](http://lol.gamepedia.com/League_of_Legends_Wiki). This website has everything I need to know about LoL eSports. Information about players, teams and every tournaments that has happened. I feel like if you guys could emulate this with your website or start a wiki yourself this would be a great thing for the community. 

**What would you like to see more of / less of?** You guys are doing great work so far. I really appreciate what you guys are doing to grow RL esports. 

That being said,
I think I would like to see more tournaments catered to the people who don't quite make the top 10. There's a lot of competition between the lower ranked teams and they make for great tournaments. Granted there are more mistakes, but my team and me can have very close matches with some of the non top 10 teams which we never see showcased.

**Is there anything we didn't do in 2015 that you would like to see in 2016?** I don't know if you guys did this before but how about you guys try to do some interviews with people who just won a tournament? Give them a short skype call and ask some questions about the games they just played or even just a text interview and post it on the website later. 

That's all I could come up with for now. Thanks for all the hard work and good luck with the RPL and Rocket League Central!",RocketLeague,cyj9k03,0,Mr Meeseeks,False,t3_3z4bos,t3_3z4bos,1451741889,,1454232787

I'm in the same age demographic as them, but when I travel I prefer doing cultural or historical activities, especially as loud clubs and bars are always a bit much for me and I don't like to drink a lot (although a quiet beer or two is always nice). When traveling around Southeast Asia I ended up staying mostly in guest houses and homestays, but this doesn't seem like an option in many other places, especially Europe.  Is there a secret to booking quieter but still friendly hostels, where people would be a little more into organizing a trip to the museum instead of a pub crawl?

False,0,Bonapartist30px,t5_2v642,1,1,BreaksFull,"&gt; Really? I was just about to say the same for you, bro!


Charming.


&gt; And you've just attempted to justify the intentional bombing of innocents. Nice try, but it's disgusting, cowardly, and there is no way it can be justified. A war is fought by soldiers, not civilians. Try to remember that.


Justified? I called it a war crime. The only thing is that WWII was impossible to fight without committing a war crime of some degree, since it was a war that involved the entire country. That's part of what defines total war, which the second world war was. The age of small professional armies fighting limited warfare decided by a few decisive battles wasn't applicable to the world wars, which were all or nothing. There was no way to practically defeat the Axis without defeating them on the home front by destroying their ability to wage war, and that was impossible without committing war crimes against the civilian population of some way or another, whether through bombing industrial centers or cutting off supplies. 


So, what should the Allies have done? Let the Nazi's rampage through Europe, depopulating it of the untermensch by millions?



&gt; They instigated the war because they knew the Allies in all their eagerness to ruin diplomatic relations, would eventually lead to a war. So, they tried to get it out of the way early on.



Oh poor innocent Germany. I suppose conquering France, Norway, the Low Countries, and Poland was just a defensive action to ward off aggression. After all, why would the rest of Europe be at all hostile to a fiercely militaristic regime rabidly rebuilding German military might? It's not like Generplan Ost existed or anything, detailing the goals of exterminating and displacing Slavic populations in Poland and East Russia to generate Lebensraum for Aryan settlers, or that Hitler ranted about that exact desire in his book. German conquest and expansion was his goal all along


&gt; Of course civilian lives will still be at risk during an invasion, but there is no dishonor in a proper invasion.


The invasion would involve the American military killing likely as many or more Japanese civilians as the bombings. Whether because of them killing drafted home guard units and militia, or because of brutal urban fighting, the Japanese citizenry would suffer horribly all the same. A moral argument for the atomic bombs was that at least when they forced the wars end, that the suffering finally stopped.


 The Japanese faced either a long and drawn out, bloody invasion, or a quicker destruction that was just as horrid but at least was quick. And this is the best 'justification' for the strategic bombing there was, or at least that one the Allies often believed. Make the war as horrible and brutal as you have to in order to make it short.


In any case, there's a very distinct difference between the Allies bombing cities to hasten the end of the war, and the Germans exterminating people for racial reasons. I'll be very disturbed if you don't realize the difference in intent.

&gt;het associatieverdrag geeft een aanzet tot het afschaffen van visumverplichtingen. Mogelijk kunnen Oekraïners in de loop van 2016 visumvrij naar de EU reizen. Oekraïne staat bekend als een land waar veel mensenhandel, drugssmokkel en illegale prostitutie voorkomt. Visumvrij reizen kan het makkelijker maken voor criminelen om ongezien naar de Europese Unie te verhuizen.  

er staat ""geeft aanzet tot"" maar als het binnen een jaartje te regelen is, lijkt het me dat er weinig tot geen discussie over is.

Daarnaast zou je kunnen discussiëren of je wel een handelsverdrag moet willen met een land dat zich alleen aan de mensenrechten wil houden als er geld tegenover staat.",thenetherlands,cyjabad,0,Nijmegen,1451744518,t1_cyjaa5c,t3_3z4oda,1451744305,,1454233145

Mulher, em geral, não gosta de homem que precise de garoto de recados.

Ou você tem a autoconfiança de flertar com ela independente dos obstáculos ou não tem.

E outra, identificar se a mulher está sozinha ou não é muito fácil, mesmo com diversos cuecas ao redor.

Isso porque o homem sempre dá um jeito de marcar o território publicamente.

Se for um cara tranquilo como eu que não se importa de deixar a mulher  dançar livremente, de minutos em minutos vai lá dar um beijinho, um abraço, oferecer água, dançar um tempo junto, etc.

Quem está ""filmando"" vai saber que ela está acompanhada.

Se for um cara menos tranquilo, vai ficar grudado nela 100% do tempo.

Logo, não tem erro. Basta observar por um tempo mínimo.

Já estive muitos anos no lado do time solteiro abordando mulheres mesmo com grandes grupos de homem ao redor e nunca causei confusão.

Algumas vezes me dei bem com a mulher e ainda socializei com os ""arroz de festa"", algumas vezes me dei mal na conquista e ainda assim fui respeitado pelos cuecas, com quem também fui respeitoso e cordial.

Nos últimos cinco anos, no time dos ""casados"", uso a técnica reversa para evitar confusão com os solteiros e até agora tem dado certo.

Uma única vez que um amigo quis crescer para cima de um estranho, mas a culpa foi do amigo por ficar quase uma hora e meia de longe vendo a mulher dançar, sem marcar presença.

Óbvio que eu e outros amigos impedimos que o estranho fosse agredido e ainda tiramos qualquer razão que o amigo bucha achou que tivesse.

I'm studying Law in a law school in Portugal.

There's a segment of the contexts for exame (which is in two days) that was barely explained in class and there's no useful notes on it.

I dont believe it will be evaluated to a great extent because it wasnt widely discussed in class, but this particular teacher has a reputation for screwing students over for things like this.

Anyway, I suppose the approach to these systems is based on the perspective of Portugal and therefore Europe.

All the notes I have consist of the following:

When Law science first affirmed as a scientific area, facing the development of social sciences, it sought to understand the juridic reality in the whole world, understanding similarities between the various juridic systems.

Roman-Germanic Systems: Not Roman Law from classic era. The source is the Emperor's Law. Generalized laws that are later applied in specific case by a set of judges.

Common Law Systems: Appearance in UK. The action of previous judges is vinculative to future decisions.

Islamic Systems: Sources are the Quran and the Sunna (tradition). Law is not an autonomous system but a reoccurrence of religion.

Asian Systems: Common Law + costume.

And there's a [map](http://www.ccaps.net/newsletter/06-05/Mochny-BR.jpg).

Seriously, these are terrible notes.

I did not understand the dimension of this, what it's worth for, the differences between systems.

And these notes don't even explain customary law, which is supposedly another system.

Based on the fact that this is for a Year 1 class, that it is in the context of Portuguese Law, and that I should understand concepts of civil law, common law, customary law, islamic law and asian law, what can you do for me?

360 million with a fertility of 3+ will seek to move. They will have to as the land ceases to be arable. By 2030 the world will have moved onto other energy sources. Meaning they can't use money to force the land to be arable as they do today.

They have three choices. Africa, Europe or Asia.

Asia will laugh at them and put them in internment camps. All Asian nations with Syrian refugees simply lock them up in prison cells and treat them as criminals.


Africa is part of the water crisis too. Meaning an extra 100 million on top of the 360.


The only option. Europe. Which has a fertility rate of 1.2 and only 670 million people. Add in the massive migrant numbers that will come and boom minority in your own homeland. At around 20-30% they might start asking for special treatment.

Max salary (non-US/Canada/Mexico national team) is $37,800. The top players in Europe routinely earn over 70,000 euros, so it is rare you'll find top European players here. Most notable are Kim Little and Jessica Fishlock in Seattle who are great, also Manon Melis now in Seattle.

Lot of other talent though: Andressa (21-yr old Brazilian midfielder), most of the Australian national teamers, Lady Andrade (made a name with Colombia at the WWC), Francisca Ordega (great Nigerian forward), of course a lot of the Canadian national team, Nadia Nadim of Denmark.

**Author**: Thomas More, Paul Turner

**Avg Rating**: 3.48 by 29562 users

**Description**: First published in 1516, Thomas More's **Utopia** is one of the most
important works of European humanism. Through the voice of the
mysterious traveler Raphael Hythloday, More describes a pagan, communist
city-state governed by reason. Addressing such issues as religious
pluralism, women's rights, state-sponsored education, colonialism, and
justified warfare, **Utopia** seems remarkably contemporary nearly five
centuries after it was written, and it remains a foundational text in
philosophy and political theory.

True, but if our time traveler was born in Europe in the mid 1970s or earlier, he probably has some residual immunity from the vaccination he received as an infant.  And if you know enough to boil your water and not eat raw foods, you won't have to worry about cholera or dysentery either.  Malaria might get you, or maybe even some ancient strain of flu. Even the bacteria that's in the air and soil will be foreign to your immune system.

The video is kinda cut off and it sounds more like ''My girl'' in a Korean accent than anything. It sounds a bit like he's saying ''My Gurr''(Gull and Gurr are common ways of saying Girl in Korea since the L and R use the same character in hangul).

Now the second video is kind of questionable because since they're playing a game they could just be repeating S.Coups words because they were excited or because they were surprised he was using a dialect instead of Seoul accent. On the other hand it could also definitely be purposely repeating the words because it sounded like racial slur. 

If they did repeat the words because of the last reason it's probably because of ignorance and because it's not frowned upon as much as in the USA or Europe. If they just didn't know then they could learn from this and we should politely let them know it's not accepted. It'd be too much to hate on them.

This may be due to the fact that this book simply isn't available in the US/UK yet apart from a fan translation which only contains the first two chapters. But it may be available in other countries, e.g. Germany and most east-european ones. 

This book's plot takes place somewhere between the short stories of ""The Last Wish"" and ""The Sword of Destiny"". I would recommend reading it, if it is somehow available to you before you start out on the ""Sword of Destiny"", because it gives some nice background information on characters appearing later on in the books. Also it is very well written. It is canonical, unlike ""Something ends, something begins"" (another book by AS), so if you want the full experience, i recommend reading it, as i did myself ;) 

So the order should be something like this: 

- The Last Wish 
- Seaons of Storms 
- The Sword of Destiny 
- The Blood of Elves 
- Time of Contempt 
- Baptism of Fire
- The Swallow's Tower
- Lady of the Lake

False,0,,t5_2zff4,14,14,part-time-genius,"I'm not very well acquainted with this subreddit and the opinions of its users, so instead I will attempt to answer your question with what I know of European federalism, as being an historic movement that enjoys varying degrees of support throughout the 20th and 21st century, and some might say is currently enjoying somewhat of a revival. 

A short answer to your question would be: yes, basically. Federalists do promote the idea of a European Federation, which would function broadly as the US does. Federalists have somewhat joined hands with what you might call Confederalists though, who instead would prefer a political construction more akin to that of say Germany, where there is a strong central government as well as fairly powerful regional states. 
As with all things Europe though, this question too is highly complex and multidimensional, and its character changes as circumstances change. Here's a little background info in case you're interested.


After the First World War, ideas about a united Europe were beginning the emerge among elites across the continent. Arguably the most influential among them was Richard Nikolaus von Coudenhove-Kalergi, founder of what would become the first popular movement for a united Europe. In 1923, he published a manifesto entitled Pan-Europa, calling for a European ‘social aristocracy of the spirit’ as a solution to the rise of nationalism, communism and (other) oppressive strong state regimes.The Paneuropean movement would prove unsuccessful, but the dream of a federal Europe lingered, though mostly among elites.


For federalists, the Second World War was somewhat of a double edged sword. On the one hand, the increasingly destructive and seemingly inescapable recurrence of war between the European nations made it clear that something needed to change lest the next war would be the 'war to end all wars' in the worst way. As Spinelli, one of the most influential post-ww2 federalists, argued: 

&gt; Federalists plan to form a small nucleus of nonconformists seeking to point out that the national states have lost their proper rights since they cannot guarantee the political and economic safety of their citizens.

On the other hand however, WW2 deepened mistrust and animosity between the European nations and peoples, thus making the federalist solution even less politically viable than it already was. But, to quote Spinelli again: 

&gt; They also insist that European union should be brought about by the European populations, and not by diplomats, by directly electing a European constituent assembly, and by the approval through a referendum, of the constitutions that this assembly would prepare.

Even if countries could have agreed, they would have had to force Europe onto their populace, which to federalists wasnt acceptable either. A solution out of this political deadlock came in the form of (neo)functionalism. In a nutshell, its the idea that integration/cooperation between states on specific issues would create a snowball effect in two ways; functional and political spillovers. Functional spillovers occur when unforseen side-effects of integration in one area creates pressure to integrate in other areas. The Eurocrisis could be seen as a contemporary example of functional spillovers, as it showed that a currency union doesnt work well without a fiscal union. We still don't have a fiscal union however, because the second element of political spillovers is lacking. Political spillovers occur when the benefits of integration in one area create pressures to integrate in other areas, and people shift their loyalty to this new supranational institution. 

Nowadays, its becoming increasingly clear that functional and political spillovers do not necessarily go hand in hand, but at the time, this was the idea. It would be put into effect with the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, in which countries' production of coal and steel was put under supranational authority. Since building an army would be impossible without coal and steel, this solution was the ideal compromise between federalists and intergovernmentalists, to whom Europe is complementary to the nation state in the way that it 'helps' countries govern effectively rather than competes with them. 


This worked quite well for a while; coal and steel was followed by pooling of nuclear/atomic material and production, and through trial and error integration did progress, eventually forming a customs union. But the underlying disagreement on what the future of Europe would look like did not go away, and soon they would find themselves at another deadlock. Those who benefitted from the initial integration projects and shifted their loyalties as a result, would not support further integration if that did not benefit them. A federalist might say they were in it for the wrong reasons. Political spillovers did not happen at the same rate as functional spillovers. The customs union came under pressure with the oil crisis in the 70's, and national political leadership reasserted itself in opposition to further integration, much like it does today. 


The functionalist approach was abandoned, and instead European leadership began working on a drastic overhaul, a great leap forward. With many compromises made, this eventually led to the European Union and the creation of the Euro in the European Monetary Union. The hope was that this would bring so much economic growth that everyone benefitted so much that political spillovers would catch up, and enough loyalty would be produced to do whatever was necessary to keep the project going. The closest thing to consensus is that this failed, that not everyone benefitted, that stronger interdependence creates animosity as much as it does solidarity, if not more. So now we're back at a new crossroads, but one that looks all too familiar. Public approval for the EU is steadily decreasing and nationalism is on the rise. European leaders are trying to fix the European Union by tweeking it with regulations left and right, but it is questionable that this will really work in the long run. Again, some federalists favor another great leap forward, but this time a truly comprehensive one. But many others think that this, still, is not politically viable in the near future. 

I hope this rant helped shed some light on federalism in Europe. Let me stress though that this is not a textbook summary, but rather my interpretation. Again, the complexity of these matters makes it so that there is never a single story, and every attempt at providing one is bound to fall short. Though this wall of text suggests otherwise, I've skipped over a lot of things for the sake of brevity, and as a result I've probably oversimplified a great deal.

Especially if you choose a competitive field where your peers are + 3 years ahead of you because they've sketched daily at uni. You have to keep in mind that competition is fierce even for the local , entry level jobs because the market is already saturated.

That said, there are also some possibilities.
Having an English lit degree and gaining some experience with the adobe suite (Photoshop, illustrator &amp; indesign) , sketching &amp; brainstorming. Could give you some advantage in a small local advertising studio as a copywriter or project manager where language and communication skills are extremely valuable. Working in small teams also gives the opportunity to get (somewhat) involved in the creative process.

Also possible is to gain experience in service &amp;/or user experience design (UX) where they look for creative people of all walks of life. Having good drawing skills is definitely appreciated as an unschooled designer.And i'd suggest to develop a small portfolio to illustrate your communication skills and enforcen your motivation to start anew in this totally different field. Because I can't stress this enough, A LOT is driven by your motivation to work in this field and it's definitely not for everyone.

Unpaid or minimum waige internships are (unfortunately) a good way to get into this field.

Note that there's a difference between Service &amp; UX design. But I'd say that it's a good bet to look both. I'm seeing more and more industrial &amp; digital design studios looking into  adding service design to their portfolio. Mainly because it gives the opportunity to create meaning in a bigger context across disciplines. But beware that trends such as this can be fickle. 

Getting an extra degree/certificate is definitely valuable and even then getting your foot in the door will depend on loads of extra factor such as connections, location, company structure and personality.

False,0,Denmark,t5_2uayg,3,3,Lazin," - No. **But** directly insulting ""officials in function"" that is employees of the stat on the job (not on their off time) is technically a crime/misdemeanor, punishable with small fines (I can find examples of 1.000-1.500 DKK = 150-225 USD). There are similar stuff for offending/insulting royalties. Keep in mind that some members of parliament are openly against the royal house and are not prosecuted due to this, being against (or for) something and insulting is two separate things. It is quite rare to happen. Last time was in 2009 when 3 Greenpeace activist snuck their way into a galla dinner... and they were acquitted. You can pretty much say what you want, popular comedians make very crude jokes on their expense, no worries. Of course discriminating insults are illegal, say ""I fucking hate you, you motherfucking bastard"" is fine but slur someone with racial or sexual slurs and it would be illegal.

 - I doubt even doing *more* than suggest it would be inciting to violence. As long as you are not outright illegally carrying or selling weapons, you're good. Promoting rights to own weapons is not crime. Arguing you need them due to specific groups of people, might be considered bigoted/discriminating though, but again, not something you would be prosecuted for I think. E.g. ""I need to carry weapons because all the Islamist/Poles/Swedes/gays coming to this country are dangerous! Sign this partition to allow ownership/carrying guns!"" Might be illegal due to discrimination, but I doubt you would be found guilty, maybe asked to change the reasoning to ""I need guns to feel safe in country/home again!"" and you're fine. **You could actively work to allow guns, without it being a crime.**

 - **No, you can criticize any religion you want to**, and many many people do so. We've had a priest basically say he didn't believe in god, people are generally not that religious and it can [baffle some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVc1ab2RcMs). We have in elementary a very strong focus on being critical to.. well most things really. Teaching critical thinking is very important, and I think that is reflected in the population. I mean **don't be a jackass** and seek out people/places were religion is important, and go all ""All religion is a human maed-up lie to control you mindless feeble willed people, wake up sheeple!"" but being critical towards any and all religion, sure, you can. Most people just consider it a private thing, kinda one of the point of Lutheranism/Protestantism, that religion became less organized, that is god is everywhere, and you do not need a priest to translate/convey the word of god to you, make up your own mind. As long as your (religious) thoughts and ideas don't infringe on others, who gives a crap?

 - I really doubt that is completely true. But I do not know enough about French politics and laws to say for sure. It honestly sounds like exaggeration of a single case where someone got accused of lying, it was found not to be true, and having lost a lot of credibility for months/ever, had the accuser prosecuted for defamation. At least something like that could happen in Denmark, I think. Does that mean you as everyday person cannot say what you want? Of course not, but if you're a journalist or maybe have a big blog, or are somehow a public person that people listen to, you have to be a bit more careful with your words, before you just accuse people of lying, especially if they make a living on people trusting them, as politicians kinda do.

 - There is a big difference between what is theoretically law and what is practice. People insult each other wildly online in Europe as much as they do on reddit. Again I think it is mainly about who/what you are and who/what you write to, like the last point. I would say ""heavy regulation"" suggest that police are spending time looking online correspondence through to see if someone might be insulted, but really it is up to individual people to bring it up. In practice I think any laws there might be against insulting people online, only allow people who might be stalked online to have a specific law that they can accuse people of breaking.  


 - What? Ehh a bit like 4th point. If you mess up someones life by making up lies about them, they might sue you... is that what you're asking? Does not seem that unreasonable. Otherwise I might misunderstand the question.

False,0,,t5_2r52c,2,2,noviceastronomer,"Southville is the classic option. But one thing i will say about someone who used to live in southville, and know people who still do. The parking there is ridiculous. Driveways are extremely rare and there is huge competition for parking spaces. I believe our mayor has some scheme in place where you pay for spaces now, but none of the residents i know of are happy about it because it involves paying with nearly the same competition for spaces as before. I wouldn't recommend. Nice area surrounding a primary school but it's crowded as hell, and don't get a lot for your money. 

My advice, albeit not tailored to what you've said about 30 minute walk from temple meads. Filton/stoke gifford. A lot of new developments going up in that area at the moment, houses are constantly being built. Much more modern than you can expect in the center, so better energy efficiency and space. With local, new amenities such as a primary school and a short walk from parkway train station which goes straight to temple meads. I thought i'd give you a good alternative, although i'd say this area would be better suited to a couple that intend to settle here. I think if you're gonna be here a while, that area would be a great investment in property, if you were gonna get a mortgage that is. 
The only thing i'd say is you've got a lot of supermarkets and cribbs causeway in close proximity (relatively) but not so much little, independent shops like butchers and fishmongers. So there's that to bear in mind. But lots of open space and stoke park, a national trust site that overlooks bristol which is absolutely great for running tbh. 

Hope this gives you something to think about

That's exactly what I had in mind. It was an alternative to the 8 groups of 5 scenario a 40 team tournament would present, since I know a lot of folks are not fond of the uneven numbers in the groups. 

&gt;The thing with the voting system, the more I think about it, is that European nations hold an appropriate level of power to their reputation anyway, just not in a formal voting sense. If someone like Italy suddenly started seriously campaigning FIFA for video replays or something, they could threaten to boycott the World Cup and their concerns would be taken to discussion pretty quickly. If Jamaica said the same thing, you're more likely to get suspended for being problematic or something.

That's pretty much exactly how I feel. UEFA already has most of the influence and soft power. The voting system is designed to give smaller nations a little leverage, but it is only engineered in such a way because it recognizes the very fact that UEFA has a level of power and influence they can't hope to match.

&gt; think there definitely is corruption in some of the smaller nations (what Jack Warner did with the Haiti earthquake relief funds was disgusting), but to automatically brand all of them like that is wrong, it's not even the nations/FAs themselves that are the problem, it's the individuals within them that are diverting funds to themselves.

Precisely. Eurocentric fans would prefer to just ban the nations altogether, though. Easier that way. 

&gt;And you're right about Qatar, Blatter was a fan of the USA bid.

I was a big fan of it too, if only because it would keep the tournament in CONCACAF and maybe improve Jamaica's odds of getting through a bit.

I try to keep all watches in my collection as original as possible. The watches are in varying conditions (generally very good). All prices excluding shipping, although deals can be made. I live in Belgium, Europe, but I have no problem shipping worldwide. It's easy, fast and cheap. In the past I've already shipped a lot of watches to the US, without any issues whatsoever.


**Shipping worldwide is about $15.**


**If you want more info/pictures on a watch, PM me.**

Here's the list of watches from left to right. Either send me an edit of the first picture with all the watches you like circled, or send me the corresponding numbers of the watches you like. Obviously telling me ""I like that steel one"" isn't going to work. 

I've got plenty more that I'm likely going to sell in the future, but I only list a couple each time. Let me know if there's a specific watch you're looking for, and I might be able to help you out. Also, if you're looking for vintage boxes, or full sets (watches with boxes and papers), I also have a few that I'm thinking of selling (not as many as last edition though hehehehe).

Since I never wear any of these watches, I can't guarantee perfect timekeeping - unless otherwise stated.

The pictures do a fairly good job of portraying it already, but if you hadn't noticed; the watch is in excellent condition! Both crowns are original and signed JL. The case is clean with some light scratches - mostly on the caseback (the case ring on the E855 is often notoriously hard to unscrew without scratching the back). The dial is pristine, I think it has been replaced by a NOS one or refinished at some point. White cream dial with gold indices and hands. The watch comes on an original NOS JL-signed NSA bracelet (worth €400 on its own).

It is the only armed group in Lebanon that was founded around the time of the Lebanese Civil War who's goal wasn't to fight other Lebanese, but to fight the Israeli's for their occupation. 

Hamas is mainly a Saudi Backed organization. Although Iran did give money to them, they have been cut off since 2011, and compared to Saudi Arabian and other Sunni money the amount is peanuts. 

&gt; **At least 50 percent of Hamas's current operating budget of about $10 million a year** comes from people in Saudi Arabia, according to estimates by American law enforcement officials, American diplomats in the Middle East and Israeli officials. After the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, the Saudi portion of Hamas financing grew larger as donations from the United States, Europe and other Persian Gulf countries dried up, American officials and analysts said.

&gt; **Qatar reportedly pledged more than $400 million** in aid to Hamas during an October 2012 visit to Gaza by Qatar’s ruling emir at the time, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani.

But when they were still getting money from Iran it's 

&gt; Iran - Its contribution was once estimated at $3 million a year.

Overall everyone has supported Hamas at one point or the other in the Middle East, but with the strong Sunni/Wahhabi influences and majority of funding the rift has opened. As Hamas trained and has supported Sunni extremist groups such as Al-Nusra and the Islamic Front in Syria.

As for the Houthis, they get support from many nations, Iran, Syria, Iraq, Russia, China, etc. They are mild and not religious fanatics, as the Wahhabi's and Sunni's that have taken over the government backed with Saudi Arabian oil money.

The main people they have been fighting in Yemen are Sunni, from Saudi Arabia, to Al-Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula, ISIS's expansion into the area, and Al-Islah, which is part of the terrorist organization known as the Muslim Brotherhood.  

If this was any other nation, the Houthis would have been viewed like the Rebels in Libya etc, and as people who are fighting oppression. ",worldnews,cyje35k,0,,False,t1_cyjan3e,t3_3z4x8l,1451753083,,1454234995

Islam is one of these Ideologies..Atheism is also one denying the very God who gave them their liberties..

While the far right are just a little slow at excepting others from other places...Both are bad and one must be in the Middle in order to be a good leader.

You must support American values and hold them higher than any other culture ..But you must not fringe on the people who want to practice their culture, as long as that culture does not take away the freedoms from those people..Like Islam which puts women into completle submission ,and to ideologies like Atheisim which deny the very God again that gave them their rights...
THey think its just a given to know these things but its not..It was Christian principled men knowing that only God can give liberty and that by placing God as the authoritative head then nothing can override that law...But Atheism trys to destroy this completely...

False,0,,t5_2qh9i,18,18,busdriverbuddha1,"Oi, eu sou professor de inglês. A sua escola trabalha com trabalhos escritos? Você tem que entregar redações ao longo do semestre?

O ideal é que você faça cada redação em duas versões. A primeira o professor examina e apenas indica onde há erros, sem te dizer a resposta certa. Ele pode, por exemplo, marcar ""ortografia"", ""tempo verbal"" etc. Aí você refaz e ele corrige de verdade. 

A segunda coisa é aplicar *tudo o que você aprendeu na aula* nos seus textos. Vocabulário, gramática, tudo de novo e especialmente o que você não estiver se sentindo à vontade para usar. É muito comum nessa transição do intermediário para o avançado o aluno ficar numa ""zona de conforto"" em que ele só usa vocabulário de alta frequência e gramática básica. É o que chamamos de *intermediate plateau*. Depende só de você vencê-lo.

Finalmente, a partir do avançado, a noção de *registro* se torna muito importante. O seu texto é formal ou informal? É um artigo de revista ou um ensaio científico? É uma carta para seu amigo ou para o presidente da sua empresa? Cada matiz de formalidade requer vocabulário e formas gramaticais específicas. Certas formas gramaticais (usar *if I was* em vez de *if I were*, por exemplo) são inaceitáveis em textos formais. 

Se você já lê em inglês, procure essas marcas de registro. Qual a diferença entre um texto de um tabloide e de um jornal sério? Um e-mail informal e uma carta formal? Tudo isso te ajuda a construir um vocabulário útil para cada situação.

Finalmente, não se apresse. Você está (pelo que diz), na transição do B2 para o C1 (procure a tabela CEFR se não sabe do que estou falando). C1 leva em média três-quatro anos de estudo para alcançar (o teste de C1 é o CAE) e o C2 é às vezes uma vida inteira de estudo. Não desanime por não escrever no mesmo nível que um profissional de comunicações que é falante de inglês nativo e fez graduação e pós em inglês. Foque nos *seus* objetivos. O que você quer escrever?

You don't even need a ""certain point of view"" for it. Even if you incorporate the stories outside of the movies, the entire order was essentially, ""Let's create as many psychological problems as possible!"" due to poor communication and even outright emotional abuse and neglect of others.

(Mace Windu telling Anakin to go meditate? Seriously? Anakin needed to *do* something, not stew in his fear. And that's far from the only example in the movies alone. Toss in the EU, and everyone who goes psycho gets started that way due to stupidity from folks who should have known better. Anakin wasn't the only Jedi to have the BPD signs—and I do believe the anger management issues and such are a to-be expected consequence of how the order set things up and shamed people for their emotions.)

A factor that I don't really see folks address is that Anakin came into the order at 9, already a concrete thinker and a native speaker of Huttese. So he was tossed into a foreign mindset, culture, and language at the same time, and nobody bothered to translate for him. No wonder he had all those problems!

Toss the facts that the Sith mastermind behind Anakin's use as a tool (but Anakin wasn't the only tool—just the most visible one!) was known to mess with people's perceptions and thoughts + might've outright been Anakin's father (potential meaning in the Darth Plagius references).

Also:

You:
&gt; Also, Ramsey wasn't played on the right to offset Cazorla ""defensive shortcomings"". He was played there because he was still better than Campbell, Ox, etc. even out of position.

Me:
&gt; He [Ramsey] gives us a balance because we have Özil who is an offensive player, we have [Alexis] Sánchez, we have Giroud or Walcott and Cazorla so to balance a bit defensively, I use Ramsey on the right,” said Wenger. “That’s where I will certainly continue to use him, unless the game demands to attack.

You:
&gt; Also, that article is from this year about why Wenger doesn't want to use Ramsey in Coquelin's role not Cazorla's. It doesn't touch on why Wenger went with Cazorla in the middle over Ramsey.

Yes the article is indeed about why he doesn't want to use Ramsey in Coquelin's position (something I'm not even suggesting) and he also gives a reason:
&gt; Asked if he would pair Ramsey and Cazorla, Wenger said: “Defensively, certainly, it’s a very adventurous one. He is more an offensive player. He is not a tactical defensive player. He is not afraid to tackle but he likes to go in the box and he has a good timing of runs and he wants the ball and he wants to go forward. If you take that out of him, and you say ‘Look, you have to sit now, and sit there and wait,’ you kill his strengths.

However, the quote I posted was about why he uses Ramsey on the right in which he says it's to provide balance since Ozil, Sanchez, Giroud and Cazorla are all offensive players. 

&gt; You've said numerous times that you think that Wenger choosing Cazorla over Ramsey in the middle was a bad decision, so that's obviously what's being discussed.

Yes I've said Cazorla over Ramsey is a bad idea but I said nothing about why I might think he went with Cazorla over Ramsey. I don't know where you're drawing that conclusion from.

It lasted two thousand and sixteen years, but the Cross finally fell. A great war near the birthplace of the Christ-child sent countless numbers of Ishmael's people running from their sandy homeland to the forested realms of Europe, in the lands once ruled by those who followed the wise god Odin, or Wotan as he was known by the locals. The people of Central Europe, not realising that the followers of the Bible and the Qu'ran can co-exist, rose up against what they perceived as a threat not only to the stability of their nations but to the very fabric of their culture. These fanatics were backed by a new military force who falsely claimed to be the reborn Teutonic Order. After driving every Muslim from Central Europe, the Teutonics turned their attention to the perceived weakness at the heart of Christianity itself - Pope Francis, who had not only sympathised with the refugees but also excommunicated the leaders of the Teutonics. A bloody swathe was cut through Italy as a full invasion was mounted, eventually leading to a siege of Rome. The Swiss Guard held out for a while, but they were overcome by the sheer numbers of these crazed zealots. Pope Francis was publicly crucified for the crime of apostasy, and the good Christians around the globe wept as the sadistic, violent new Pope, Urban IX, took office. 

It was the inauguration ceremony of Urban IX that truly signified the end of Christian domination. A huge crowd gathered in the Vatican, primarily terrified Italians aggressively coerced by Teutonic soldiers. Burly men bristling with bullets surrounded the new Pope as he received his pallium. Yet, as the cloak was draped on him, the people in St. Peter's Square were blinded by a thick cloud of mist, creating a moment of mass panic until it lifted seconds later revealing a dreadful yet glorious sight. The murderous new Pope's severed head was held aloft by an old man in a black cloak and wide-brimmed hat, one-eyed and bearded, with a raven perched on his shoulder. Blood poured down his arm, but he simply brushed it off. He calmly placed the head at the foot of the Basilica and walked out of the Square, ignoring the frantic efforts of the Teutonics to attack him. The old man vanished into the same mist that heralded his arrival, leaving Rome and the rest of the world, who had been anxiously watching the ceremony, in a state of shock.

It took a matter of hours for the instantly re-formed religion of Odin to take power. The old Germanic and Norse territories were the first to return to the old Gods. The monarchs and leaders of every country in Western and Northern Europe met at the ancient site of Uppsala for a great sacrificial ceremony. Churches had their crucifixes torn down by the thousands and replaced with carved figures of Thor, Frigg, Freyja, Baldur, Loki and the Allfather, Odin. In a matter of weeks, Christianity in Europe had been almost entirely supplanted by a new form of Norse paganism. The Teutonics lost their seat of power in Germany, but held onto isolated strongholds throughout Italy and pockets of Central Europe. 

After wiping out the last vestiges of Teutonic resistance, the Europeans decided to undo their work and open their borders to refugees. It was to their surprise that the migrants from Syria had survived, travelling further south into the sub-Saharan regions of Africa, where many groups of formerly Christian people had suddenly found themselves without a God, allowing the Syrians to spread the word of the Qu'ran, a book which had been largely re-interpreted by the Muslim community in light of the new belief that the Norse gods were allies of Allah. With diminishing support, the radical groups within Islam dissipated, allowing for new alliances between European, African and Middle Eastern nations, based not on the greed of businessmen and politicians but on faith and honour. 

The defeat of the Christian God at the hands of pagan Gods was seen in other nations as a sign that they should return to their pagan roots. The Celtic parts of the British Isles, namely Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Cornwall saw a resurgence in the faith of the Druids, while eastern Russia witnessed the rebirth of many lost religions. South and Central America saw a restoration of their respective sacrificial religions, while the nations of Oceania played host once more to countless Polynesian and Aboriginal beliefs. 

The Pagan Resurgence, as it was later known, was only avoided in three major regions of the world, besides the spread of Islam in Africa. The government of China, with its largely state-controlled media, was able to take advantage of the end of Christianity by taking credit for the victory over the Christian God. In the turmoil, the armies of China took over various surrounding nations, claiming that their new state-approved syncretic reinterpretation of Buddhism was responsible for the end of Christianity, allowing them to consolidate absolute power in Southeast Asia. India, with its mostly Hindu population, saw this as a sign that Hinduism was more powerful than Christianity, but brokered a new peace with Pakistan on the grounds that the newly dominant form of Islam would be friendly with non-Muslims. Eventually, the two countries re-integrated. The last vestiges of Christianity clung on in the USA, where the formerly Confederate states of the South saw the events in Europe as evidence for the weakness of the Catholic Church, which only strengthened their faith, splitting off into a new nation called the Confederate States of Jerusalem. However, the multi-religious societies of the North and Mexico, ranging from followers of Odin and Jupiter to followers of the Great Spirit and Quetzalcoatl, were regarded as enemies, provoking war on two fronts. Unsurprisingly, this was largely unsuccessful for the Christians, culminating in a final siege on the city of Dallas, which eventually fell, signifying the end of the dominion of Jesus Christ and the final fall of the Cross.

Places where getting a quota of meat, or indeed any meat at all if you're living in a refugee camp, would be a god send. It's because these behaviors are ultimately cultural in their manifestation.

I have a few ideas. The concept of the rule of law western style and western ethics being foreign to the local populace because they don't subscribe to the holistic idea of 'society'? The fact that they are ethnically diverse which means the tendency for the ""us"" (our tribe) vs ""them"" (other tribes), that are often escalated to full blown genocides?

That said how are flawed, nominally capitalist systems a defense of communist experiments projected onto the populace involuntarily? All things I said are undeniably a direct consequence of 50 years of the Warsaw Pact. CEurope was not a 3rd world shithole, ""civilization"" existed there at least for 1000 years, it is also strongly homogenous. There is seemingly no reason for the strong preference for 'every man for himself', as neighbors who were never part of the soviet block don't experience that. Hell, you can observe a significan difference within borders of one existing country: west Germany is very different from the east.
Communist order has set the Central/Eeastern European countries back by decades economically and has damaged the national psyche, that's a fact.

&gt; Anyway, my main point is that all of the hardship you describe is just as possible under capitalist systems - objectively, political systems in and of themselves are not good or evil, only their implementations.

yet it's the capitalism that has much better track record compared to the alternatives and has lifted billions of people from the abject poverty. Hardcore socialism on the other hand has an extremely high failure rate.

plural noun: prudes

a person who is or claims to be easily shocked by matters relating to sex or nudity""


Youtube is an american company, run by Americans with american ideals.  Sadly most Americans are prudes.  They can't stand naked people, or the idea of talking about sex or sexual things unless its in an educational format, and even then, they have to use other words to describe things like penis and vagina.  This prudish behavior is what they've always done, and you can't even attempt to tell them otherwise, its like discussing gun laws with them.  Where as, their European cousins are open about their sexuality and have no issues with seeing a woman breast feeding in public or people talking about sexual activities on television.


But for some reason they(*the Americans) love their violence.  They love watching things blow up, people being cut down by machine gun fire, and general nastiness.  You can shoot people, drown them, bury them alive and still get a parental guidance age 13+ rating.  Show one nipple and the prudes are back and your slammed with PG 16+ or worse.
TL;DR - Americans Are Prudes.

I think studying abroad might still be your way of getting out. However as far as I know, to process the student visa in another EU country, you'd usually have to do that from your home country? So that still means going back... In fact, to process the student visa in any other traditional study destinations (eg US, Australia, Canada etc) is also usually done at the embassy in your home country. I might be wrong about this though.. 

Final edit: there's almost never a case of 'never getting out again' unless you're imprisoned or end up in war zone like Syria or something. One way or another, there will be a way out..

But considering that buprenorphine has a higher affinity for the mu receptor than naloxone (as evidenced by the lack of effectiveness of naloxone in buprenorphine OD), then adding naloxone was perhaps a political decision rather than one based on actual therapeutics.

Eventually this growth will stop; Like it has happened for all real sports. First you have the development of the sport, then professional infrastructure, with coaching and academics, then sports science, then simply the previous years giving people info to work off of...

E-Sports in general - even long-standing games like CS and SC - are still going through this.

Korean LoL is already slowing down in this term as they approach the peak (at some point there are no more secrets to be learned), but due to how their scene and culture is, they will always have talent at this level which will further push it towards excellence.

NA, EU and China are lagging behind, but they will get there. Needless to say the Wildcard regions are as well, more so.

With the big changes in the NA and EU LCS ecosystems this year, even with things like VC-backed/funded teams, along with of course LCS Format changes, both NA and EU should grow by leaps and bounds within the next two years.

With that said, with the 2016 Spring Splits still being Bo1s and the Summer Splits being experimental ones, along with the simple fact that change takes time, I expect us to see the real results only in 2017 and onwards.

I mean, I thought that TSM's example of changing their coaching staff - with the non-LoL player but professionally educated coach as a Head Coach - would be followed suit by everyone, yet, we have respectable teams like Liquid taking Locodoco; Not to say that former Pros cannot be good coaches - they just don't have the pedigree for it (thus, IMO, it being unlikely) and Loco specifically has failed at that job already (he should be a strategic coach).",leagueoflegends,cyjhksl,0,,False,t1_cyjgm6o,t3_3z5vs5,1451759206,,1454236639

Territorial integrity comes before self determination. Self determination does not entitle a people to take land they happen to live on. Where are you going to draw the line on that? Should Newcastle have the right to secede and join Scotland? If you want independence you either have to fight for the land or have an agreement to keep it with the sovereign. You can't just gerrymander whatever border necessary to get more than 50% in favour of secession.

&gt;the rest of the EU would indeed recognise it.

I really doubt it. The EU wants ever closer union, not countries stealing territory. It would be a terrible precedent and other EU countries would be fearful of regions of their own country escaping. West Germany is much richer than east germany, maybe it will want to secede at some point.

&gt;I highly advise that you seek out some Scottish nationalists, ask them why they want independence and listen. 

I had many arguments with them during the time of the referendum. I don't see any argument why they need independence. It's a waste of time and would cause massive infrastructure problems. They wouldn't have a right to use sterling, nor would they have a right to continue using the NHS or many other things. It was feasible at the time of Irish independence, it's not feasible anymore. That's why even amongst Northern Irish Catholics the vast majority oppose leaving the UK. The Scottish only want independence because they lost their privilege of 12 years of Scottish Prime Ministers, and think they will be richer on their own. Poor regions like Northern Ireland don't seek independence. It's selfish and I can't agree with that without a strong moral justification.

I mean, look at transportation: the trains were the way people got around. Buses came along, but they coexisted. Cars came along, and when they were cheap enough that most or all people could afford them, you might expect that the cars would lead to the deaths of the trains and buses. But (Europe, at least) still has lots of trains.

Planes may have overtaken boats as the primary means of going to foreign countries, but people still go on cruises. The Channel Tunnel didn't lead to the end of the ferry services to France.

The Internet has, similarly, forced a change in the way things work, and not a complete eradication. Magazines and newspapers still exist. It's easy to ask why - I mean, you can get all of your news from the Internet, faster than you can get it through traditional print media, and for free. Why does anyone both buying newspapers, or magazines?

Email has massively reduced the number of letters being written, but people still post letters.

The only example I can think of right now of where an emerging technology totally and completely eliminated an old business model is Blockbuster. I don't really know of anyone know who rents DVDs; everyone streams things online, instead.

In many, if not most cases, a new technology will not lead to the complete erasure of the older style, even if it does lead to a significant drop.

I suppose that we are, to some extent, not talking about rebuilding the Internet, just the World Wide Web. Taking note of the distinction, I would reply to your question that we - you and I - as individuals cannot build something to make Google and Facebook and Microsoft obsolete because we simply don't have the money.

I have no idea what it cost to build the Internet and the WWW, but I suspect the cost, starting with DARPA and ending with me playing Katy Perry Pop on an iPhone, is staggeringly vast.

A small group of people from Reddit don't have the money to redo it to our preferences; I doubt that even if Reddit as an entire group pooled our resources, we could do it.

It needs change, but I just don't think it can be done without either convincing the companies involved to change, or changing capitalism. (I was reading some op-ed piece online a few days ago, where someone was suggesting something along those lines. Amongst other things, he was advocating a change in how we view and use information - instead of letting a small number of companies fight to protect their little bits, pun intended, we need to make it easier to share information.)

Unless something pretty major changes, I really doubt the Internet is going to change in the kind of significant ways that you or I might want.

Alfred tilted his head to the side, frowned, then started shaking violently, his hands going right up above into the air.

""You're bloody mad!""

Winston raised a finger. ""I prefer brilliant.""

""Mad.""

""Brilliant.""

The laboratory door to the left of them slammed shut and the smirk of a vaguely attractive brunette stopped the men's annoying ritual of foreplay.

""Action Suit 56! Clause 20. Don't forget Page 7 as well, clause 12 in the third ruling. I could go on,"" she said mockingly, her tall figure sauntering over to both men. A look of shock on Alfred's face but a look of annoyance on Winston's.

Winston made to interrupt her. ""I'd actually prefer if you wou-""

""-Instant dismissal! Arrest. Maybe even cryogenic containment. You know I hear stories about those jettisoned out wake up and spend the remaining days alive, drifting out into the nothingness of space, their screams unheard.""

Silence fell within the laboratory. Winston adjusted his jacket, smoothed his short brown hair, scratched his chin then made to speak.

Alfred cut him off.

""Harriet. Amongst many undesirable traits of which you are, stupid, regrettably, is not one of them.""

Winston smirked and Alfred stormed ahead with his speech.

""So, well, get the bloody hell on with it. What do you want. You know this is our career's on the line.""

Harriet mocked ignorance and offered out her hands and gawked credulously. ""I don't know what you mean. But obviously, I mean to come along. I haven't screwed over half the board and risked everything for this job just to sit at a desk checking data.""

""No, you haven't,"" Winston said. ""But time travel is not reserved for the whims of an admin servant.""

Alfred swore under his breath and sat down. Harriet grinned wickedly.

""Still a ruthless flirt, though you've lost a bit of your edge, if I must say.""

""Oh shut up Harriet.""

""Come on, Winston, it was fun for a while, wasn't it?""

He let out a deep sigh, as if there he bore an invisible weight on his shoulders. Turning to Alfred he smiled and then looked back at Harriet. 
""You really aren't going to forgive me, are you?""

She cocked her head. Flows of shiny hair cascading over her slender shoulders. ""Did you really think I ever was, my dear boy?""

A loud bang suddenly exploded in the lab. Smoke unfurled from Harriet's hip and Winston crumpled to the floor with a carterised hole between the eyes. Harriet concealed the Laser Colt M-11, winked at a terrified Alfred his face as white as calcium and approached the controls of the machine.

Working furiously, Harriet engaged the mechanisms to fully calibrate the machine to time travel. Once pausing for a moment, then returning to adjust the scanning tools so that it would read the atomic composition of a human body nano-sceonds before being shot down the laser tunnel, she felt ready and stood back from the machine.

A much gentler voice cried whispered from behind her and Harriet turned, still smiling.

""Harriet. Did you always have this in you?""

She looked down at Winston's dead body, inclined her head a little and then met Alfred's eyes with a cold stare. ""Well, of course. It's why they call it cold-blooded murder. Are you ready?""

Alfred frowned, sweat beading at the top of his quivering brow. ""Ready?""

""Yes, ready. Or have you pissed yourself?""

""Ready for what?""

Harriet took out his M-11 and pointed it at Alfred in annoyance. ""For god's sake, Freddy, I took you as the smarter of the two. You didn't think I was going to offer myself as a guinea pig?""

""No,"" Said Alfred. ""No, you can't be serious. Harriet, that thing isn't ready. It could kill me. Send my matter to multiple instances in space. Across different moments in time.""

She shrugged. ""A small misfortune us scientists must account for when running experiments.""

The time machine began to hum at a low frequency and the lasers within the main tunnel fired. The length of the tunnel ran through the complex at an impressive mileage which meant the coordinated diplomatic agreement between half a dozen countries. At this, Alfred really began to fall apart, standing up and begging.

""Please! Harriet! It was Winston that made you suffer, not me!""

She ignored him, waving the M-11 in his face to get him to enter the machine.

""HARRIET! Listen to reason!! You don't need to do this. Use something else! ANYHTING!!!""

Harriet ignored this too. Instead shutting him inside the chamber and going back to the control pannel to press a few glyphs that were now highlighted on the glass. A hologram now presented itself outside the chamber door, which she walked to and began making final calibrations and scanning Alfred's composition ready for time travel.

She smiled through the hazy blue hologram at the face of a petrified old man she used to work for.

""Do let me know if it's worked, won't you?"" And she pressed the final button, enjoying the final screams of the scientist, as his body was fired down the laser tunnel, his matter seeming to slow down as if frozen in time, before disappearing completely.

The emptiness of space is a myth. that it's an endless void filled with space between things. Between the matter that has helped to build the universe. For in fact, those spaces between worlds and dimensions are filled with a great many things. A discovery that was made a few centuries after the discovery of dark matter and its' properties. As such, this vital piece of knowledge was what Harriet had calibrated for. And it was for this reason, Alfred's very body, down to the last atom, materialised in mid-air, not 2 feet above a cow pat in the middle of a field in China somewhere. The year, 1320 AD.

Alfred gasped, leapt to his field immediately from the fall, looked around confused and then immediately began to vomit violently into a nearby bush.

After wiping his mouth and taking in a deep breath, he noticed a few small rodents scurrying away from his mess, toward the safe haven of a small wooden hut of old 13th century Chinese design. Alfred knew nothing of when and where he was until he approached the house. From his expert knowledge he dated the building as between 13th and 14th century, and definitely Chinese. 

""Why here?"" He said. ""Why now? What's so significant about China in the..."" Alfred paused the smell the air and eye the son in the air. The dew on the grass. ""...late year sometime in the 1200's or 1300's? Good god, it's worked though. Christ. It actually worked.""


*****


Harriet took less than 4 minutes to completely vaporise the dead body of Winston, her former colleague and was soon back home with her feet up and the media interfaces all synced wonderfully. She wiped her hand through the air from the comfort of her coach, not a care in the world for what heinous crime she had committed. Carelessly perusing the media of the internet, current new developments on the Mars colony, before checking on the historical archives on pandemics.

A few minutes later, now stood in the kitchen blending a vegetable beverage, her hands now swiping at the same screen on the glass top of her kitchen counter, Harriet directed the glyph's on the screen to the top, creating a hologram that floated a few inches above the surface, directly opposite her face for reading at ease.

""Ah!"" She suddenly exclaimed, looking down to see a turtled shell cat with a white face and paws. ""Hello Tidder, want to see if something I did worked?""

The cat purred unquestioningly.

""Excellent."" 

Her well manicured finger manipulated the glyphs on the glass screen which caused a great chunk of text to appear in the hologram. A bolded title was superimposed over the top before the rest of the text loaded.

**The Black Death - A devestating pandemic and its' origins.**

Harriet scrolled through the text, gave up on patience and entered in a keyword.

*Indo-European*

A result immediately superimposed itself over the rest of the text and Harriet, almost nervously, touched a glowing glyph on the corner of the glass screen.

She gasped. Then slowly re-read the text.

*It is still a mystery to scientists and historians, as to the origin of what appeared to be the remains of a skeleton of indo-european origins. In that the person that was excavated in China, would have originated from somewhere in East Europe. What was more puzzling about the discovery, as cited by (Klopp, 2032), was that new methods of carbon dating put the skeleton at over over 700 years old, despite have completely unique markers, giving evidence to the widly controversial theory that the man was in fact an alien.

The Alien of Death theory has perpetuated through British and now Worldwide literature and film for many decades since, due to the curiously advance and undecayed compisites found inside the male skeleton's bones, including the ones in his teeth. It's argued that it would be impossible, for a man of European descent, to be in China in the 1300's, with cranial and dental implants, which far exceed the technological capabilities even of current science (Keller and Owen, 2050).*

Harriet's face seemed to darken. She looked down at Tidder, picked her up and held her infront of her face.

""Tidder, my little sweet. We've got so much to do.""

I always pick out my lodging and travel place by place, you can of course buy a package tour or go through a travel agent, which takes the burden of planning off you at the cost of money and flexibility.

Google flights is a good way to find cheap airfare to Europe, you can punch in a date and go to a map view that shows the cost of getting to various cities in the region you're looking at. I typically use that to get to Europe and then plan the rest of my trip from there.

For lodging, Hostelworld.com is good or you can use airbnb if you don't like the idea of staying in a hostel. Or again google hotels in the city you want to stay in.

Trains are not difficult at all to use, you can buy tickets online or go to a kiosk at the station that is in english and pretty straightforward. Don't buy a rail pass for a 3wk tour, it only pays off if you are doing a ton of traveling.

That's because you don't know that much about Gandhi. Read up on him. He was branded a terrorist, national security threat, accused of inciting violence (yea) and all sorts of stuff. Bottom line: Gandhi/Mandela were all branded terrorists at the time they stood up to the empire. You think gandhi wasn't - but he was too. Same like Mandela. But the world knows (through countless british documents/historians/journalists-at-the-time) that they clearly were NOT.

&gt;If you instead want to discuss how India would be a backwards shithole instead of being mostly a backwards shithole but with modern cities if not for British colonization, we can.

You are missing a key aspect here. It's FREE, rather than being second grade citizens, they are running their own country. If India were still under British rule, it would be backward ass to the core. But in just 70~ years of independence, they have managed to develop nuclear weapons, send an orbiter to MARS, create arguably the world's 4th most powerful army (after US, Russia, China), and is booming economically. Ofcourse they have social/economic/structural issues. Which country doesn't? You calling it a 'shithole' shows your understanding of the world ""America GOOD, Europe Good, India/Africa bad""

These countries were oppressed/ruled by the British till about 50-75 years ago. Compare that to the US, and you guys were still burning ""witches"" 100 years after your independence. I am not attacking the US - just showing you that how much of a 'shithole' you are depends on where in history you stand. 

&gt; there was significantly less gun violence in the Wild West than today in Africa

You're comparing AN ENTIRE continent (africa) to a country (US)?? Plus, US has the HIGHEST number of mass shootings in the world, BY FAR. 

Now, Before you blame the blacks for it - read this ----&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. According to a widely respected study (see link below) , which looked at mass shootings in the United States since 1982, white people -- almost exclusively white men -- committed some 64% of all mass shooting.

Being a little chubby was as status symbol. You didn't do manual work and you had excess food. Plus I can easily see how a traditional mating symbol, like well built hips on a woman, could be accentuated or compensate with a little extra fat on a woman. 

The only time I can think of obesity as being desirable is when cultures became fundamentally fucked up in some weird way. When you have an extremely competitive social environment it can emerge as a status symbol, specifically certain periods of European culture pre-Reformation (Pope Leo X if I'm not mistaken was so corpulent he couldn't hunt, so he'd be carried on a palanquin down to the edge of the forest and his game trappers would capture live game and bring it to him so he could watch it be slaughtered. He pretty much single-handidly inspired Martin Luther to write his 99 thesis), and some Polynesian tribes who tied Mana or spiritual potency to corpulence, so you got like 600 pound chieftains. 

But that's very particular cultural anomalies working against genetic attraction. Nobody wanted to sleep with or be with these people because they were fat, but they were ""desirable"" from a social status and power standpoint.

I absolutely would not say that historically people prized obesity. They prized good breeding potential, and while being a little bit overweight accentuated a lot of those characteristics, especially in women, anything that breaks out of that and skews towards obesity was generally short lived and inspired by a very small upper class with highly competitive social dynamics. It also wasn't particularly long lasting.  

Someone mentions Rome in this exchange, but it's not fair even if it was accurate, because something like 95% of the population of Rome, even at it's cultured height, was in abject poverty. During the Antonine period, which is generally considered to be the peak of Rome, it had a population of 60 million or so. Of those 60 million, maybe 150,000 or so qualified as ""middle class or higher"" (Equestrian or higher) and was financially stable. Of that 150,000, maybe a few hundred to a thousand was of senatorial wealth, which is where you started seeing the real weird social competition. So when you talk about opulence or corpulence in Rome, you're talking about like .01% of the empire.",fatlogic,cyjmudr,0,,False,t1_cyj9t02,t3_3z3jl6,1451768342,,1454239191

&gt;Are you forgetting about HVSS?

No, I did not. But HVSS and Easy Eight's were not widely available during the War. Hell, even in 1945 most of them weren't upgraded to HVSS. 

&gt;Plus the 500 HP GAA gave the Sherman a better power to weight ratio which is very helpful in rough terrain. 

Partly true. While the Engine was a nice upgrade over the old radial and diesel engines, the use still varied. I mean, the A1 76(W) was produced till 1945. Also, engine power is not everything which is especially true in rough terrain. If you have narrow tracks, or in this case, NOT HVSS, you can have as powerful an engine as you want and you can still get bogged down because the tank has terrible flotation. 

You know what my issue is with this argument? There were a gigantic amount of Sherman versions which were all used throughout the war. Even after the allied victory in europe not all units were upgraded to more modern Shermans.

Many Western Europeans participated in the enslavement of Slavic people because they weren't seen as Christians.  The Alantic slave trade comes out of this history and of the new demand for cheap labor in the Caribbean and South American colonies.  There was increased economic demand for slave labor in the 1600-1700s (in the centuries prior to this slavery had been dying out in Western Europe), and as Africans were not Christians, Christians could therefore participate in the trade of African slaves.

No it doesn't, but you make it sound like a negligible risk [when it clearly is not.](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/wcm/road_safety/erso/knowledge/Content/20_speed/speed_and_accident_risk.htm)  You seem to be of the mind that other drivers on a 100kph section of road will be aware that another driver is going double that and react accordingly.

Yes, and this is because most accidents are minor fender benders that occur when people don't check their blind spots before changing lanes.  In fatal accidents excessive speed is a contributing factor ~30% of the time.  

&gt; Driving at night on an empty 4 lane highway is perfectly safe in an Audi R8  

The photos from the news article were taken during daylight hours weren't they?  Can't say whether the roads were empty.  I would argue that driving at night when you don't have sunlight to illuminate your path reduces the time to react to hazards even further, making it more unsafe.

False,0,,t5_2snuc,1,1,mverobeach1,"We are definitely coming to apocalypse, but it won't be some ""event"". It will be very gradual, and over time, our species will decline probably to the point of extinction and we will take many other species with us, and perhaps even life itself.

The culprits will be a combination of global warming and resource depletion. Global warming alone will render most of the world's largest population centers uninhabitable which will lead to a massive refugee crisis, which will lead to political and economic chaos which will inevitably be manifested in increased military activity.

Resource depletion will also have far reaching consequences. For example, in the 1930's in the US there was the Dust Bowl. This was the result of European settler farmers plowing up the native grasslands of the central plains in an attempt to grow non-native crop grasses. The native grasses of the Plains were what held the soil together, and when they were gone, the topsoil of the Plains simply dried up and blew away. The Dust Bowl ended because countless tons of petroleum based fertilizers were laid over the entire region. Without a massive influx every month of this synthetic petroleum based fertilizer, and the petroleum based insecticides that go with the fertilizer and the seeds engineered to grow in the fake soil, the Plains would revert to the Dust Bowl environment, which is an uninhabitable desert. The central Plains is the breadbasket of the world. Almost all food today is made from corn and corn byproduct. Without the high yield corn that comes from industrial Plains agriculture, mass starvation will ensue. And when oil runs out, all oil by-products also run out, including synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.

There is no combination of alternative energy that will ever replace oil. Everything in the modern world requires oil. What will replace plastics? How would the modern world exist without plastics? Imagine a hospital without plastics. What about the rest of the energy infrastructure? What will power international shipping? The cargo ships that a modern global industrial economy require have engine pistons the size of buildings. There is no energy source that has yet been discovered that will efficiently move those pistons up and down to power those ships. No ships, no international shipping, no international trade, no foreign investment, no global industrial civilization. What will power planes?

The answer, of course, is nothing. There aren't enough of the rare earth minerals that are needed to build photo-volactic cells needed to harness the sun's energy to power the modern world. Wind cannot produce the energy, even if used in conjunction with all other energy forms to power the modern world. The entire economy would have to be relocalized and downsized in order to stave off the inevitable piddling out of fossil fuels, which has already begun. And there is way too much money involved in propping up this dying system for any society or nation with influence to deliberately stunt their economic growth, allocate the last drops of oil to the most necessary uses, and begin phasing out the global industrial economy. So it will just continue until resources get scarce, which we will see this century.

As far as arts and culture, that will also continue to decline as it has throughout the last few centuries. Art and culture depend on diversity. Human cultures are disappearing at an alarming rate. Linguistic, spiritual, and artistic diversity have been slowly declining for a long time. With industrialization and globalization come standardization. It's just a function of mass society.

Take a look at a UN meeting. What does everyone wear? Business suits? What languages are most prevalent? Maybe half a dozen, with English having overwhelming importance. And they all belong to nations with the same kind of governments, incorporated into the same economy based on the same principles. Everyone is one of about 5 or 6 religions divided between Vedic and Abrahamic traditions. And everyone lives in houses. Gone are yurts, tipis, igloos, longhouses, huts, chickees, and the dozens of other different homes humans have lived in throughout history. How can there be cultural or artistic development when culture and art are solidifying into a standard global format?

So, obviously our species is on the way out the door. This isn't upsetting because we will be the few people who were lucky enough to be born into the generation that will see the end of history.

IT’S 4.03am on Friday July 8.

Adrenalin is running high at the Manchester Central convention complex. It has kept the sleep-deprived campaigners of both pro and anti-EU camps energised through the wee small hours.

Three regional recounts have only added to the tension. An exit poll has handed the vote on Britain’s membership of the European Union narrowly to the Yes camp.

But tensions are high and, given the past performances of exit polls, no one is quite sure what the final outcome will be. The regional results, which have flashed up one by one on the large electronic screen, have only confirmed that the contest is too close to call.

Herald View: Battles lines being drawn for the EU fight ahead  

Finally, Jenny Watson, the Chief Counting Officer, nods to her colleagues, takes a deep breath and strides onto the illuminated stage. There is a sea of expectant faces and a nation is holding its breath. So too is Europe.

Gripping a single piece of paper, the chairwoman of the Electoral Commission announces the landmark result: 52.1 per cent to 47.9 per cent. The United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union.

Promoted stories

An explosion of emotion erupts in the convention hall. The cheers, smiling faces and cries of jubilation from the anti-EU camp are mirrored in their scale by the groans, closed eyes and tears of defeat by the pro-EU camp.

Union flags are waved in triumph by the “outers” but there is a twist to the tale. While the UK has voted narrowly to leave the EU, Scotland has voted, 55 per cent to 45 per cent, to stay. In Edinburgh, there is talk of “unfinished business”.

The markets take a hit. The FTSE Index plunges seven per cent in early trading but by the end of the day is down just 160 points. Turbulence in the weeks and months ahead is guaranteed.

The in/out campaign itself was marked by recrimination and bitterness.

The wound that the Conservative Party had for so long been able to keep closed burst open after David Cameron emerged, following months of delicate talks with his European counterparts, claiming victory on his bid to reform Britain’s relationship with Brussels.

But the package fell well short of what the Eurosceptics had wanted. It was “an insult to the British people”, declared John Redwood, the Eurosceptic former Cabinet minister.

The PM’s attempt to get a four-year ban on in-work benefits for migrants crumbled as member state after member state objected. The compromise of an emergency brake on migration, hailed by the Prime Minister as a political triumph in a club of 28 nations, was deemed an embarrassing failure by his opponents.

Five Cabinet ministers had threatened to resign if their leader did not allow a free vote. Like Jeremy Corbyn a few months earlier on the Syria issue, Mr Cameron was faced with a dilemma, particularly given the seniority of those who were intent on voting No; these included Theresa May, Michael Gove, Chris Grayling and Iain Duncan Smith.

In the end, like the Labour leader, the PM allowed Cabinet members to campaign on either side. But all this did was to lift the lid on bitter wrangling among senior Tories. Damage had been done to the Conservative brand and, whatever the outcome, it was hard to see how Mr Cameron, if he won, was going to steady the Tory ship.

But he had lost. The issue of Europe which had contributed to the defeat of John Major and eventually saw off Margaret Thatcher had now claimed another Conservative scalp.

Within hours of the No vote, the PM, almost two years after savouring the victory of another No vote in Scotland, is again on the street outside No 10, tasting a different political dish.

He announces to the nation that he respects the British public’s verdict and will, after a short period of transition, stand down.

Manoeuvrings within his party have already begun. Ms May is lauded by her colleagues as the true voice of Britain. She quickly gets support for a leadership bid by former London mayor Boris Johnson.

Meantime, George Osborne, the heir apparent to Mr Cameron, gives a brief comment of disappointment yet already has a keynote speech planned for the following day; his campaign is ready to go.

After his brief Downing Street statement, the Tory leader turns and heads back through the famous black door; he cuts a lonely, dejected figure.

In contrast, a beaming and ebullient Nigel Farage is surrounded by a media circus. The location is Fred’s Caf, a greasy spoon in the heart of Manchester. The Ukip leader is downing a fried breakfast.

Bob, the landlord of the pub next door, arrives and plonks a pint of bitter on his table. “Never too late to celebrate,” croaks Nige as the cameras flash. “We’ve just saved Britain £12 billion a year.” But whither Mr Farage and Ukip now they have their triumph?

Back in a different part of London Jeremy Corbyn, wounded by Labour’s dreadful performances in the May elections north and south of the border, can at last indulge in a bit of schadenfreude but the respite will only be brief given the depth of divisions within Her Majesty’s Opposition. Those tectonic plates are beginning to shift again.

Over in the Belgian capital, shock waves are still reverberating at Britain’s unexpected Non. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, who launched a last-minute appeal for Britain to stay with the European family, is in front of the cameras, admitting that this is “a dark day for the European Union”. To lose Greece would have been one thing but the United Kingdom?

In Washington, President Barack Obama has already telephoned Mr Cameron to offer his commiserations but leaves the defeated PM in no doubt that Brexit will have consequences for the(not so) special relationship.

In Edinburgh meantime, Nicola Sturgeon has called an emergency Cabinet meeting for 10am. Another media circus is gathered outside Bute House, bathed in early summer sunshine.

At the SNP conference the previous autumn, the First Minister noted how having a second independence referendum if the UK voted No to the EU but Scotland voted Yes was “probably unstoppable”.

But even with another landslide victory at the May Holyrood elections, there is still nervousness about calling a snap second independence poll because, for some, there remains a doubt about whether the pro-independence camp could win it.

The referendum in 2014 showed that translating support for the SNP into support for independence was not automatic; nor, some Nationalist figures fear, is translating a No vote to the EU into a Yes vote for independence.

The Bute House Cabinet meeting has followed a range of intense early morning phonecalls between Ms Sturgeon and her senior colleagues.

Alex Salmond, the FM’s predecessor, has been the most passionate, demanding his colleague announce a second referendum in September. “Do it now,” he implores his colleague. “Scotland is ready.”

Already in Glasgow’s George Square, the saltires are swirling as Yes campaigners call for another say on Scotland’s future.

The Scottish Government’s Cabinet meeting drags on. Eleven o’clock comes and goes.

It is almost noon when the SNP leader appears on the steps of Bute House, surrounded by her colleagues, to announce that she will be recommending a second independence poll. Scotland, she declares, has spoken. Its wishes need to be recognised. A referendum Bill will be quickly rushed through Holyrood. Westminster, she insists, must give its consent; it has no choice.

Yet neither Mr Osborne nor Mrs May are minded to rush into another battle for the Union. They have a more immediate fight to contemplate; one for the Tory crown and the keys to Downing Street.

But the Nationalists are eager to re-enter the ring. Westminster only has two weeks before its summer recess and the phalanx of SNP MPs are repeatedly pressing in the Commons chamber for the UK Government to give its consent for a second referendum.

Mr Salmond is indefatigable. He voices the threat that Scotland will hold a plebiscite anyway; with or without Westminster’s consent. Scotland, he declares, not London will decide its future.

But the Scottish question is just one of an array of unintended consequences unleashed by Mr Cameron’s lost gamble on Europe.

Ahead lie months if not years of UK Government’s negotiations not just with Brussels in decoupling from the Union but with the 27 former partners.

Britain’s relationship with America and, indeed, the rest of the world has been changed with the outcome of the EU referendum.

And as the UK contemplates a second Scottish independence poll and begins the painful process of exiting the EU, within 48 hours of the referendum result, Mr Salmond, never one to let a political opportunity slip, is in Brussels giving a speech and making the point that while the European Union may be losing one family member, it can expect soon to be gaining another.

The National Science Foundation was looking for more money so they published this garbage study.   Many on reddit who hate the U.S. like to post it as if it proves something.  It does not.

First.

Confusion on the question that is popped on you out of nowhere and the person writing down the answers instructed to take the first answer no matter if there was confusion.

Second.

&gt;The survey, conducted by the National Science Foundation, included more than 2,200 participants in the U.S

The study does not say 25% of Americans it says 25% of people questioned in America.  There is a difference.   Especially with a huge illegal alien population that may or may not have even went to grade school.


&gt;Here’s the thing, though: Americans actually fared better than Europeans who took similar quizzes — at least when it came to the sun and Earth question. Only 66 percent of European Union residents answered that one correctly.

Ouch!   This part conveniently left out of the headlines.  Still does not matter though.  Even the one in Europe is bogus bullshit done by a biased government organizations looking for more federal money.

So in conclusion.

25% of American do not think the sun goes around the Earth.

- limita de 1MB/bloc incepe deja sa fie prea mica, sunt deja tot mai multe tranzactii in asteptare

- din cauza asta, e conceptul de a plati bani ca sa poti plati bani (taxa per tranzactie ca stimulant pentru mineri sa ti-o confirme)

Overall, I don't think there is too much difference between Japanese content and the West in the context of storytelling. Thematically, literary story devices, format etc are all the same usually. Very rarely does Japanese content adopt 'Japanese storytelling', as even to the majority contemporary Japanese people, these are difficult to consume and it is incredibly limited in what can be achieved in convey content/narrative/etc (eg Rakugo has limited influence with 'slap stick' style anime and manga comedies). Looking at movies and television shows, there would be considerable overlap between the themes and genres amongst what is popular for most demographics. One must consider the impact the proliferation of American media and culture, Western-centric 'soft power' and dominance through the mechanisms of globalisation etc, has in shaping media content across the globe and Japan. 

I would argue there is an equivalent Western title for most Japanese and visa versa yet there will be differences in the cultural nuances that make the stories their own. For example, Japanese mythology and folklore vs European, slight differences in cultural undertones, family dynamics, gender relationships, social norms etc. These nuances make the 'same' story different. Uniqueness in foreign content is achieved through the different circumstances of the creators (in much the same way it would between artists within the same region). Yet, the foundations of these texts remain the same in most examples.

One aspect that sets anime apart from animation in other regions is the quality of animation and the diversity of content in animation. There are limitations to live action that can be overcome through animation and anime has explored this much more thoroughly and more in-depth than Western animation largely due to different perceptions of animation/audience which dictates the market in which content can be created. This however, doesn't change my assertion that Japanese and Western content are very similar.

There are many exceptions and of course, my arguments aren't applicable to everything but, looking at content on a whole, I believe them to be true. I feel a lot of people are blind to the similarities amongst media and have a strong fixation on what is unique. This appears to be true for culture and society too. Which intersects well with the 'Homogeneous,' 'unique' myths prevalent in Japanese discourse and surrounds Nihonjinron (日本人論). I wonder how this skewed perceptive in the West is a product of Japanese soft power and Nihonjinron or whether it is more the impact of some post-modern orientalism equivalent where Japan has become  'essentialized'. And now I am going to on tangents and rambling in my post night-shift lack of sleep.",anime,cyjq8cl,0,http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Omanko_Hakaisha,False,t1_cyjooba,t3_3z5dmu,1451774499,,1454240858
False,0,,t5_2uc6j,3,3,DoneStupid,"I genuinely think tier 3-4 is about right for competitive play, it's where a lot of tank types are viable along with a good variety of competitive air power. Even if the teams are of a lower quality in a different region (at first), that doesnt mean that the region shouldnt have its own competition. in CS:GO the European scene has been dominant for years, but without its own scene the US teams would never be able to improve and close the gap.

Having a ""competitive"" queue, in addition to the usual AB/RB Air/Ground would be ideal where players have their personal rating and are matched with people of a similar rating in a 7v7 game with a strict ruleset.

I would assume that your ties to THINK (ie Zerbah, the main admin) would put you in a unique position to be invited without going through the srb routine. I heard something about one of the thunder league squads being thrown together last minute to fill the numbers, but where they found these people I have no idea. There are so many **rookie** mistakes in every game I saw, but overall until player markers and lead indicators are removed calling any squad in the league ""best"" is a farce, especially when the commentators have to shout ""what a great shot!"" every time someone managed to land a hit at 100m range. 

As another aside, with regards to the ruleset my opinion is Gaijin missed a huge trick. Having teams choose both map and nation would add levels to the tactics and decisions made by the teams, some nations are better on some maps. If a team chose Poland, and their opponent then chooses Russian (at which point they only have the Russian vehicles available to them), does the team that chose Poland choose German or US to counter the Russian vehicles? US would give them solid air superiority options, whereas German could focus capturing B and using the superior cannon strength to hold two points from distance. Being able to mix and match nations within a team just turns to cherry picking the single best vehicle for the roles you need rather than taking the good with the bad and having to make a tactical decision based on map and player strengths.",Warthunder,cyjqa1s,0,,False,t1_cyjpl7a,t3_3z6mpt,1451774583,,1454240880

An ideology is a way explaining what society is like, how it operates, who belongs to it and who does not, what justice consists of, etc.  I do not know of any Europeans who said they were buying and selling Africans  because they were white supremacists.  Rather, defenders of the Atlantic slave trade were very clear that they supported it because it was profitable and because there was nothing wrong with it (they claimed that slavery was traditional and that black people were biologically different from white people and were better suited to slavery).  I do not know of anyone prior to white people in the 1600s who claimed that a particular group of people were: a) biologically different from themselves in both abilities and appearance (mental abilities and skin color) and b) biologically suited to being at the bottom of society (a slave or a poor person).  There are many different ways in which people can be bigots or can justify oppressing others, but racism is a very historically specific ideology.",PoliticalDiscussion,cyjqn8r,0,,False,t1_cyjpgw7,t3_3z69on,1451775253,,1454241053

&gt; Liver problems, increased risk of cancer, **slower reaction time**, causes depression, **increases violence/aggression**

These two happen whíle inebriated. They also depend on the person or on the amount drunk. Personally I'm not an aggresive person with or without alcohol. Slower reaction time can be fun depending on the circumstances. Regardless, it isn't that much of a problem, you're not doing anything important while drinking. If you are, then your critical decision making skills which you should enact before drinking are not on par and that's stupid. It's not without reason that drinking on the job will get you fired in pretty much any country where drinking alcohol is legal. A sane person doesn't do it. And guess what, people have been drinking for millennia.

&gt; **Liver problems, increased risk of cancer**, slower reaction time,** causes depression**, increases violence/aggression

These *cóuld* happen if you drink a lot, all the time. Again, a smart normal thinking person goes through life without these problems. If it causes depression then there's an underlying mental issue. The person might even be predispositioned to depression. Alcohol cán enlarge those feelings. But it's important to note that alcohol isn't the cause itself. Only if the person drinks só incredibly much that he or she wrecks his brain permanently. But again, if that person decided to do so, then something was already wrong. Likely some mental issue stemming from sort of issue or trauma before.

And why don't you ""critically think"" about going outside, drinking coffee, eating fat food, getting in a car, living in a city with all the exhaust fumes and whatnot? Why don't you refrain from these things? 

Surely it's better to live a life outside of the dangers of heart disease from caffeine, the dangers of criminals or wild dogs outside, traffic accidents, smog, CO2 gasses, etc etc etc? Sure, it's better. But you'll be missing out on so much. In the end, you're just as dead. Life expectancies are roughly the same across countries where alcohol is legal and countries where it is not. And you can still live a long and happy life. There's plenty of véry old people in the US, Europe or Asia and they drink and have done plenty of things in their life. 

But a true critically thinking person knows that these dangers are there, but with a basic understanding and minimal effort lives his or her life navigating through these obstacles. Ensuring that carefulness, moderation and some smart decisions beforehand or during whatever activity he or she performs will result in a danger-free life. And thát's critical thinking. Just reading stuff from a book or even a scientific journal which says drinking = bad and applying that immediately to his or her life is not.

False,0,,t5_2sokd,1,1,Lifting1488,"&gt;First it's gentrified (ironic because you're talking about IQ)

Phone spell check. 

&gt;Second, did you just say that black people are inherently less intelligent than white people? That's both racist and offensive. I'm black, I'm highly educated, and I'm successful. I do not believe being black makes you less intelligent.

It's true. It's not racist. I can back it with multiple scientific papers. Good job. You are an outlier. But your kids will regress to the mean. 

RTM is found everywhere in nature. The study states that it should always be considered a possible cause of an observed change. RTM happens because the blacks who are intelligent are outliers. Regression to the mean is a real thing, contrary to what people may say. For instance people may say that ""the children of intelligent blacks (as an example) didn't get the same schooling as their parents or were neglected as a kid"". Well, we all know that no matter how intelligent people are. Their kids will most ALWAYS regress towards the mean for their racial grouping. It's an obvious case of genes causing regression to the mean. People may blame schooling, abuse, neglect and other factors on the reason why the children are not the same as the parents. It's a retarded statement. We all know that genes are the reason for a lion's share of how we are in life. People may say ""socialization or the environment"" is the cause. But, society is a racial construct, race is not a societal construct. So societies you see are an expression of the main populations genes in action. That's the simplest way to put it. Lets get to mean regression and IQ. 

If you want to talk about transracial adoption studies where whites and blacks where reared in similar environment, being a white home making over 200000 dollars per year, that study was done. 

In 1976, a study was conducted called the Minnesota Transracial Adoption study where they took children of different races who were adopted into different families and tested their IQs at age 7 and again at age 17. A follow up study was published in 1992. What was found, was that IQs of transracially adopted children didn’t differ at all from children raised by their biological parents in the same area.

As said in the study, blacks raised in white families hardly did any better than blacks raised in black families. If the differences supposedly were environmental in the way they say it is, how come blacks raised in rich white families didn’t reach the IQ of whites if “IQ is malleable by the immediate environment”? Because the differences are genetic.

The heritability of IQ is between .75 (as said by the APA) and .90. I like to say .85. So if the heritability is that high, then only a few points of the B-W IQ gap can be explained by environment, with the lion’s share being attributed to genetics. The heritability of the black-tie IQ gap is between 80 and 88 percent, further proving what I previously alluded to. 

People may try to point to lead lowering IQ, well, for that to be the case they would have to test the IQ of all racial groups and then test the levels of lead in each subject, which have not been done yet. That throws that out the window.

People may also tout other studies, such as the Eyferth study, which supposedly says a “100 percent environmental cause” for the B-W IQ gap, which is preposterous. First, the mothers were white, which according to the MTRA, white women and black fathers have generally higher IQ children. This is attributed to pre-natal factors. One of the single best predictors of IQ is the mothers IQ. The soldiers in the study were also pre-sreened for IQ, which is another flaw in the study. Three percent of white applicants failed compared to 30 percent of black applicants. They also didn’t retest the children again at age adulthood, as did the MTAS.

Another one people like to use is the Tizard study which study young black, white and mixed race children in a nursery setting. They were given tests to determine cognitive abilities. The white and black children both had IQs at 102.6 and 106.3 respectively. They also did not test again at adulthood.

Another is the Moore study, which tested 23 black adopted children and 23 black children adopted by middle class black families. Their findings indicated that blacks adopted to black families scored at 104 compared to the blacks adopted by white families who scored at 117. People may point to this and say “Well, they didn’t differ in their environment and not their genes, so therefor the B-W IQ gap is 100 percent environmental.” Ridiculous. As with the other 2 studies, they were not tested again at adulthood. To say that any of these 3 studies mentioned above prove a 100 percent environmental cause is intellectually dishonest.

Egalitarians love pointing to these studies saying that blacks grow up in bad neighborhoods and don’t get the same things that whites growing up in poor neighborhoods do. Again, ridiculous. It’s just pure wishful thinking by egalitarians to point to these studies to say that there the gap is 100 percent environmental. As I said earlier, it technically is, but not in the way egalitarians think it is. They think we stopped evolving at the neck and that everyone is the same both cognitively and behaviorally which is ridiculous.

On average, blacks are less intelligent in whites and Asians due to evolving in Africa and not the hard climate of ice age Europe and Asia. 

That's where altruism developed for Europeans, as well as a higher IQ due to having to plan ahead, among a myriad of other things, as well as having to care for their family. Over tens of thousands of years, evolution in different climates gave us different cognitive abilities, as well as different physical and other mental traits. 

If you deny that being blacks doesn't make you less intelligent, then you would have to find an environmental factor in all races that accounts for a depressed IQ in comparison to Europeans and Asians. You won't find it. 

Your feelings don't matter to science.

I think to get the answer to this you need to know a little bit about European social history, though. Really broadly speaking, secular classical music developed out of the european court: something like Baroque opera at first would have been performed for the nobility. As the 19th century continued interest in, say, orchestral music would have filtered to a larger part of the population, though calling that 'everybody' or even 'the middle classes' would be deceptive: it was music for the bourgeoisie, and the ticket prices would have been prohibitive for the vast majority of the population if you could even be let in.  In the second half of the 19th century the stratum of society emulating haute bourgeois manners spread, and the audience got larger: also, nationalism began to play a larger role relative to social class, so you start to get the broad idea of music for the people, incorporation of 'folk' music, and so on. But I'd basically say the idea of classical music as open to 'anybody' didn't really take off until the development of recording technology. 

Also, liturgical music is different. Bach to some extent wrote for the court, for example, but he also wrote for his congregation, which would be a much wider audience.  ",classicalmusic,cyjsluh,0,,False,t3_3z77fa,t3_3z77fa,1451778764,,1454241977

False,0,DMRP,t5_2qh4j,3,3,ujorge,"&gt; In at least some countries, the colonial powers had a very direct influence on daily governance. The political institutions were theirs, as were the police force, educational institutions and more. For some of these countries, when the colonial powers left they did so suddenly, **leaving these countries without all these vital institutions and requiring them to build them up from scratch**.

The last part of your statement (in bold) is not entirely true; you don't offer any examples, so I'm not saying that this didn't happen.  But in Latin America for example when the Spanish were kicked out the locals just kept running with most institutions as they were before.  After all, there was a transition period in the time in which these countries declared independence and when the Spanish were actually defeated.  For most people, life continued as it was before if there were not directly involved with the fighting.  So I wouldn't put much weight in the sudden absent of colonial administrators (which in most countries were local people... in fact, most of the soldiers fighting on the Spanish side were local ""[royalists] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalist_(Spanish_American_Independence)"").

&gt;It is easy to envision an alternative past in which these institutions were slowly handed over to the people of the colonised countries instead, ending up with functioning institutions though tainted by colonialism.

You mean like Canada...?

BTW, this is an interesting topic and it's really worthwhile to look into the link of a country particular experience with colonialism with the way they developed.  An interesting example is Haiti, which I think is the most appalling example of exploitation that I can come up with.  Haiti was France richest colony, but at the costs of thousands of lives of African slaves that were literally worked to death.  When the slaves rose and kicked out the colonists it was a really bloody affair and I think the experience left the Haitians with a deep distrusts of Europeans and their institutions that is reflected to this day.

If you compare Haiti with its neighbor in the island of Hispaniola (the Dominican Republic) there is a huge disparity in economic development even though you couldn't have two countries as similar as these two.  Besides the D.R. being about twice the size of Haiti, they have very similar terrain, natural resources, population, etc.; this [IMF working paper] (https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2007/wp0763.pdf) found that in 1960 both countries were actually at very similar stages of development and concludes that political instability and different economic policies explains much of the difference between both countries today.

But the Dominican Republic has traditionally been more open to the outside world (foreign investment, tourism) than Haiti.  This is clearly anecdotal and I would like to see a more formal investigation into this, but I've actually met more than one Haitian who refers to the tourism industry in the Dominican Republic as ""slavery"" and who said that they would never allow foreigners to ""own property"" in tourists areas.  I've said a lot, but my theory is that Haiti harsh experience with colonialism is the reason for their distrusts of foreigners and how close their economic system is.

False,0,RUSS,t5_2qh4j,3,3,IvanMedved,"Western countries snowballed the wealth based on the industrialization process made possible by the colonies exploitation. 

The exploitation consisted in exclusive economic relations with the colonies which provided the resources in imperfect market conditions, since they couldn't seek other demand than their Western metropolis.

While the ex-colonies lost their opportunities to follow the same process the metropolis did.

In other words because of the colonialism, ex-colonies had to specialize not following the path a global market but the one marked for them by their masters.

Taking in account severe protectionism tendencies of the Western states until the very end of decolonization process the ex-colonies which gained freedom had to face a new global market which in case of the one thing they were specialized at (resources) was one of buyers and not suppliers. 

Or even in simpler words — **colonies were forced to specialize in something that doesn't bring wealth in the long run**.

That created a gap that cannot be closed even in a long period, because the Western countries gained advantage in markets with high-cost entry barriers (like high tech and science) and are maintaining it year after year with new investments.

Some ex-colonies like India or China thanks to the huge volume of their markets can in fact subsidize own high tech and science with governmental help. Thing which smaller countries cannot manage.

Obviously some countries would be poor even without colonization.   Another question is that Western countries would never be so rich without it and in this the author is clearly wrong by saying:

&gt;And it seems quite possible that colonial nations such as France and the U.K. would have gotten rich without their resource plunder, as did Germany, South Korea, Switzerland and Taiwan. 

No. Those are very bad examples. In each and every one you can follow their respective economical history and see the capital movement. Clear example of South Korea and Taiwan with American capital inflow for ideological reasons. Same could be said about post-war Germany. Pre-war Germany, Switzerland didn't have any colonies and were very poor in pre-industrial era (in case of Germany depended of which region, because the country didn't exist), but were surrounded by so-called Great-Powers who facilitated trade and other businesses.

The case in the UK regarding the judiciaries’ remedies to breaches of the HRA is that they may make a declaration of incompatibility, informing and requesting the government of the day to repeal the particular section, but there is no other remedy, the judiciary cannot give satisfaction to the victim of a breach. Although instructed to interpret ‘so far as possible’ all national legislation, the domestic court has been reluctant to toe this new constitutional line. So one could only imagine how much more their powers would diminish if the government had the final say on decisions, rather than the EU court. 


With that in mind, the international law on treaties being as it stands (that a sovereign nation, is in fact sovereign) the fact being the British government is only bound to uphold it’s own legislation, namely the HRA, in contrast with the European Convention on Human Rights (the text of which constitutes the HRA), which is the ruling legislation between the UK and EU in giving sovereignty to the EU court on certain matters. So if it so chose it could rewrite the HRA and refuse any punishment or judgement from a supranational court for breaches of the ECHR, doing so arguably constitutionally thanks to the unresolved issues of parliamentary sovereignty.

Jefferson was a true liberal, so *he would* say that, but I don't think you're taking in to account the very real dangers of religious extremism which was prevalent at that time. 

Many early Americans were highly suspicious of Roman Catholics following the Protestant Reformation, for instance. They had good reason to be, considering the already well established history of Jesuit infiltration and political intrigue in various parts of the world - Europe especially. This is why when the Declaration of Independence was signed, it was illegal for Catholics to vote or hold public office. 

You might say that in those days the people were much more cognizant of world history. The intrigue that the Jesuits were involved with at the time was deadly serious, after all, and a strong argument can be made that it still is (many of the most prominent politicians and world leaders are Jesuit educated.)

In 1720, for examples the Jesuit General Michael Angelo Tamburini, said to the Duke of Brancas:

""See, my lord, from this room I govern not only Paris, but China: not only China, but the whole world, without any one knowing how ‘tis managed.”

This issue was America's Achilles heel back then and it remains so today.

The Fallout post mocking the OP for talking about SJWs was posted at 10:25AM which started a chain of upvoted people also mocking the OP.  The SRS post was made at 11:19AM.  My post was made at 12:34PM.

I guess the gators want us to believe that A) SRS did quick work brigading in an hour to get a thread with vote totals encouraging enough for me to make mention of it as a point of sanity (despite their bragging that the FO subreddit has 3x the sub base) B) the ONLY way someone on the internet would think they're full of shit is if we brigade them C) my comment where I didn't link to the actual convo was somehow a call to action and the reference to our sticky about how all the accusations of brigading have zero evidence to support them is proof of brigading

By the way.  The Fallout thread is from yesterday.  The KIA thread is from 9 hours ago.  Let's see what's been posted since they linked to it, shall we?

The US now has FATCA. For a US citizen it is now pretty much impossible to hide money in any form from the IRS in a respectable bank. The only way for hiding money in a proper bank is by having someone ""fronting""you. Fronting means someone else pretends to be the owner of the assets and the bank doesn't know that the real owner is actually a US person. If the bank finds out, the US person gets kicked out and most probably an anti money laundering report to the IRS is filed. 

If that US citizen is fine with stashing his millions in a bank in a third world country like Liberia, then he might get away with it. However, one won't get the service quality and stability as a Swiss bank will offer in Liberia. 

For EU citizens and Australians the CRS and bilateral agreements with Switzerland will kick in from 2018. Then all the client data will be exchanged. For example the German tax authorities will know of all German tax subjects who keep Swiss bank accounts. 

However, in light of this upcoming trend, the large Swiss banks are now already forcing clients from all over the world to become totally transparent. For example UBS and CS is starting in 2016 to force their Russian clients to prove that they paid all their taxes in Russia on the assets they keep with them.

&gt; There is a third group of people—those who accept the literal message of the Bible regarding Noah, the ark, and the Deluge. Latter-day Saints belong to this group. In spite of the world’s arguments against the historicity of the Flood, and despite the supposed lack of geologic evidence, we Latter-day Saints believe that Noah was an actual man, a prophet of God, who preached repentance and raised a voice of warning, built an ark, gathered his family and a host of animals onto the ark, and floated safely away as waters covered the entire earth. We are assured that these events actually occurred by the multiple testimonies of God’s prophets.

They date this around 2200 BC.   Other events that are considered literal (and more or less feed into the other doctrines or rituals and the story of the Book of Mormon, which is also considered literal):

1.  7000 year temporal existence for the earth. 

2. Real Adam and Eve as the source of all humankind around 4000 BC. 

1.  Real Tower of Babel as a source of all languages (~2000 BC), that caused a migration to the Americas (note that apologists over the last 20 years have been trying to change this to among the great migrations in an unspecified area, but the official doctrine from Joseph was quite clear).  

4.  Real Jewish settlers around 600 BC that brought technologies such as Steel, European style swords, chariots, the wheel, and metal armor.  

5.  Joseph used a magic rock, called a seer stone, to translate golden plates that he found in the side of a hill by his house. 

Mormons are fundamentalists. It gets crazier, by the way, so the average Mormon's faith requires them to accept the belief despite evidence to the contrary.  Not all members believe all things, and I'd say no Mormon believes all of the doctrine of Mormonism.  Still though.  It is what it is.

##What do you like to talk about?

I love Disney movies, Buzzfeed, politics, books and just generally hearing about your day! You should be interested in chatting equally about the mundane day-to-day parts of life as well as the exciting and sexy. I love animals and would be happy to see pictures of your pets! 


##GFE Questions

Please answer these to the best of your ability and send them in a private message to /u/memoriepatton. The subject of your email should be your Reddit username.

What time zone are you in? (I am in Central, -6gmt. Usually European time zones and Australian time zones conflict with my time zone, if you are in these time zones you purchase at your own risk, I do not do refunds based on timezone conflicts. The light usually works best for these time zones.)

What are you hoping for a GFE type experience?

What kind of photos would you really love to see?

What kind of videos would you really love to see?(KIK videos are about 15 seconds long).

Are there any times you are not able to chat besides when you are sleeping?

What is your typical sleeping pattern? 

Are there any fetishes you have you'd like me to indulge in?

Are you okay with the 3-4 block of time per day where I will be unavailable to chat?

Are you able to receive NSFW photos at work? Are there any times you are not able to get photos?

If you are interested in the heavy package, what would you be interested in for your additional service?

What method of payment would you be most comfortable using? I currently prefer to accept Amazon Giftcards and Bitcoin, but we can discuss other options.

&gt; This obsession over being isolated would make us look no better than North Korea. 

You mean like Woodrow Wilson's policy of nonintervention in Europe keeping us from being dragged into WWI except on our own terms. Oh, and N. Korea has labor camps, death camps, you cannot leave, the people are starving in the streets (I don't mean missing a few meals, I mean malnutrition that can hardly be imagined in a country as wealthy as ours- are we #1 in terms of nutrition? No. But we're far from N. Korea.)

&gt;So wouldn't it make much more sense to give them easier access to becoming a citizen rather than trying to round them up and deport them?

The logic goes that they've already shown a great disrespect for our laws and customs by coming here illegally and it's disingenuous to those who enter legally to offer amnesty, in the same way giving amnesty to war draft dodgers offended an entire generation. I admit, I don't *necessarily* agree with this policy. I think they're generally great people, very helpful to those in need on the whole. But hey, it also isn't as monstrous a policy as people make it. There's points to each point of view.

&gt;You do realize that America is supposed to be the land of opportunity, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.... 

I know the words well. You know where those immigrants went as they sailed past those words? Ellis Island. For processing. They were entered into the system and came here *legally*. Apples and oranges, man.

&gt;And anyways, the occupations that undocumented workers find are usually dying careers that Americans generally don't bother with, like agriculture.

Again, in part because of poor pay and working conditions. Let's assume that we legalize everyone. That's one fix. Declare an open border, though, or we'll just see more illegal immigrants come in. Or we can shut down illegal immigration, at which point the wages and working conditions *must* improve, or the work will go not-done. Perhaps solvency can be assigned via subsidy.

&gt;The sad truth is that the American economy relies on cheap labor, whether it be here or taken advantage of overseas.

It doesn't have to. There were good jobs here before globalization and free trade demolished them. Tons of them. And lots of these low-pay jobs paid a lot better- a roofer made almost double then what they do now.

&gt;We've come a long way from our racist past, and it disgusts me that people like Trump want to send us back.

Back to what? Colored-only? I don't think he's advocating for that.

O quote principal eu considero esse:

&gt;""are not incorrect when noting the follies of modern art, but their total rejection of it is beyond the pale and thoroughly reactionary.""

&gt;""Bouguereau's strength,"" Vallen wrote in an e-mail, ""was his dedication to the craft of painting, and his technical mastery of oil painting can't be denied. If today's artists knew but a fraction of the painting skills possessed and employed by Bouguereau, they would be better off.

&gt;""Nevertheless, Bouguereau was also imprisoned by his extremely conservative vision of what painting could be -- and that was his greatest weakness.""

Enfim. Comentando em especificos do seu post:

&gt;Se arte precisa de contexto pra ser arte, se o contexto se perder, a arte deixa de ser arte. 

Voce esta pensando aqui no contexto fisico me parece, mas existe tambem o contexto historico, social, cultural. Arte nao existe em um vacuo. O video que eu passei discute Duchamp especificamente, no caso do fountain foi umas das primeiras peças que pergunta exatamente o que você esta perguntando: *o que é arte?* Vale lembrar que Fountain foi criada em 1912, para epoca isso eh extremamente inovador. Ele forca a discussao passar alem do material para o intelectual, em fato esta criando essa discussao agora, entre nos dois. Para usar o video que eu linkei antes, se tudo que voce ve olhando fountain eh um urinal voce nao esta vendo fountain.

E toda arte precisa de algum tipo de contexto para ser completamente apreciada. Eu adoro arte clássica, um dos meus periodos favoritos é Dutch Golden Age e entender o que esta sendo representado em telas dessa fase faz o conteudo muito mais interessante na minha opiniao. 

Isso, obviamente, nao significa que toda arte moderna ou contemporanea eh de boa qualidade. Para finalizar gostaria de mostra [esse](https://i.imgur.com/8CALjNU.jpg) e [esse](https://i.imgur.com/Vozs7Tk.jpg) quadro do cara do seu vídeo se realmente queremos exemplos de mal-gosto e arte inutil.

How can you accept a destructive policy like multiculturalism? Racial equality isn't real. Think about this; Why is the third world what it is? All things like Civility and civil society, Civilization, Human rights, and all Freedoms(which are all white and partly asian concepts) dissapears the same moment you leave White Western Civilizations put your foot in the refuse of their countries. 

It's not because of an external factor like Jews and liberals who with use of the [Controlled Jewish Media] (http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Who-controls-your-mind-2013.jpg)  constantly and deliberately Lie about. **It's because its inhabited by Third Worlders** who have a different, unevolving, destructive and as such in an inherent behavior, Much unlike our White Race which by population is in reality a minority on this globe because mudskins outbreed us. 

Multiculturalism is pure death and destruction under the guise of false morals and abusing the effeminate decandence instilled on people by media i.e societal ""trends"" and ""education"" today.

&gt; /u/swagnarok69 I just don't think that whites should go out of their way to remove other races. We just need our own countries.

Most National Socialists are for peaceful solutions like geographic separation not genocide, which for example in WW2's the ""holocaust"" which Jews have since they won fabricated [ and constantly lie about.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53W4tWJcCm8) [[**2**]](http://holocaustdeprogrammingcourse.com/) [[**3**]](http://balder.org/judea/Six-Million-140-Occurrences-Of-The-Word-Holocaust-And-The-Number-6,000,000-Before-The-Nuremberg-Trials-Began.php) But then again do you think the 14 Million blacks and other third worlders and parasites like Jews and their cooperators in America for example, will leave their life of free money and leisure quietly which is all paid by a working White majority to go back where they came from? No they won't. 

The only reason our civilizations are able to carry so much destructive **dead weight** for so long alone is evidence enough that we are superior, but doing it is no excuse for doing so. We will be deliberately destroyed by the Jews pushing this, and enthnically replaced if it's not stopped.

&gt; /u/swagnarok69 What does ""Multiculturalism"" mean to you. I personally have no issues with mixing of culture VOLUNTARILY, I just want an opt out button like Japan has...

Multiculturalism is a destructive policy which was first created by the Jewish Frankfurt School as a by product of """"Critical theory"""" which first spawned it, and other such purely destructive policies and ideas to attempt eliminate the White race. Jews understand very well that without a White majority there is no civilized society, and therefore more leeway for them to gain control over what we have and create a JewSSR Version.2 just like they did in 1917 under which bloodsucking and megamurdering regime the Jewish Commisars killed 60-70 Million White Europeans untill it's demise and their crimes being unpunished shortly after it many Jews changed their identities, emigrated from Russia, to criminal safe havens like israel and to the rest of the world.

At any rate, it's probably due to geographical demographics. 

In Ferelden black and blonde pigmentation is more common, while ginger and blonde are more common on Orlais and the Free Marches. Brown seems more common amongst Antivans, and Brown and Red are the dominant colours amongst the dwarves in Orzammar. We haven't seen the Anderfels yet, but given it's excessively hot desert climate black will be the most likely colour.

As the first game plays in Ferelden, the second in the Free Marches and the third in Ferelden and Orlais, the lack of brown hair is not quite so strange. It's a pre-industrial age, so the level of cross-migration is relatively low. 

It is not as odd as it seems; Hair colour is, after all, a genetic trait. In Scandinavia almost everyone's blonde, and in the Middle East and Asia almost everyone has black hair. (of original descent, obviously). Brown hair is almost entirely exclusive to the socalled 'Western World', meaning Europe and the USA. 

In the USA one wouldn't notice the relation between location and genetics, as everyone who isn't a native American is 'import' . (for lack of a better term, because immigrant seems to offend everyone.) 

In regards to lazy... The actual hair style options. Over 5 bald options for women? WTF? Did they actually even consult anyone without a penis?

Being a son of an immigrant and a nephew of a freedom fighter from a place of oppression (Communist Cuba ruled by Fidel Castro at the time), Ted Cruz knew too well the value of individual freedoms and what it was like not to have them. Ted Cruz loves America and its values, and America is fortunate to have someone like Ted (and Donald Trump) to take back the country from the heavily infiltrated enemy that deviously and surreptitiously planed to overthrow this Constitutional Republic and replace the U.S. Constitution with Sharia Law. It was unfortunately that most Americans were, and still are, too ignorant to truly understand the Islamic death rape cult as, for the most part, a repressive, subversive, supremacist theocratic political system masquerading as a religion that also teaches people to lie (Taqiyya/Kitman), so that the Muslim-In-Chief (http://freedompost.org/muslim/infiltration/barack-hussein-obama-the-muslim-in-chief.html) was able to taqiyya his way to the White House with ease to contribute his part to the global Islamic jihad effort (http://freedompost.org/islam/deception/civilization-jihad-aka-stealth-jihad.html), and the consequence was rather harrowing, devastating, and deadly, not only for the U.S. and its citizens but also for the non-Muslim world, especially for Christians, Yazidis, and non-Muslims in the Middle East and Europe.

While most Americans were being fed with their usual daily doses of the brain-numbing ""Kardashians"", ""Dancing with the Stars"", and ""Honey Boo Boo"",  Ted Cruz was working hard at the U.S. Supreme Court, and subsequently at the U.S. Senate, to defend the U.S. Constitution, individual liberties, religious freedom, and American values.

It's great timing that Ted Cruz is now available for the rescue of the nation in crisis from the spiraled lawlessness and corruptions now ubiquitous in Washington D.C., to preserve and protect the land, the U.S. Constitution, and the fruit of labor of the American Founding Fathers and their collective geniuses, from being sabotaged by the enemies, both foreign and domestic. 

For more than a decade, laid back yet super intelligent (Princeton grad with GPA 4.0, and Harvard Law grad), patriotic (Constitutionalist, Tea Party supporter), articulate (debate champion at Harvard), all-around classy, and fearless Senator Ted Cruz has been fighting against corruptions and abuses of power in Washington DC at the expense of his own popularity there, antagonizing sell-out politicians like Mitch McConnell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE6HLbaAL0A), John Boehner,  Obama's tool IRS Lois Lerner (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCyfgKGI1_c), Obama's ICE peon Sarah Saldana (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-04Y1iJ5MyY), Obama's lawless minion Attorney General Eric Holder and his successor Loretta Lynch  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXnzZzLyCnQ, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdMrVwW_pzc), yes, the same Loretta Lynch who stirred controversy by threatening Americans with persecutions for offending Muzzies immediately after the San Bernardino attack that left 14 dead civilians (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS4970WZKaY).

Alias uma boa parte da crise que estamos vivendo aqui e no mundo, é culpa dessa cagada, mas isso ninguém menciona, e inclusive nega.. por que lucra em colocar toda a culpa nos vilões favoritos do pais, e o pior muitas vezes culpam as politicas sociais, que estao largamente documentadas, com numeros, os beneficios que trouxeram(contrariando a velha armadilha do ""cada um por si"" que é própria pra privilegiar uma minoria).

False,0,moderator,t5_2ssp3,585,585,400-Rabbits,"No, there's no evidence of this, and quite a bit to militate against the notion.

First, the positive evidence. The encyclopedic work compiled by Friar Sahagún and many Nahua scribes from interviews conducted in the decades post-Conquest, *The General History of the Things of New Spain* speaks directly to this. This is what it has to say about children born during this time:

&gt; And if one were then born, there was great fear of it, there was ignoring of it. And if it were a man, they named him Nemon, Nentlacatl, Nenquizqui.^1 Nowhere was he counted, nowhere did he belong. He was a profitless man. And if it were a woman, she was a profitless woman. 

There's nothing about infanticide, and the *Historia* is not a text that shies away from discussing such matters. Durán, writing later, simply says that children born during this time period were ""considered unfortunate.""^2 Again, nothing about mass infanticide over a 5 day period.

There's a tendency to exoticize American cultures, particularly in such a way to depicts them as less rational than stoutly post-Enlightenment Europeans. I should know, because while I was undergoing a vision quest my spirit animal appeared and told me that my great-great-great-great-grandmother (who was a Cherokee princess) told me I should live in harmony with The Land, which cannot be owned. In Mesoamerica, simply invoking the ""Ancient Mayans"" is usually enough to set a thousand crystals vibrating with source energy.^* 

The Aztecs, by dint of their penchant for human sacrifice and their well publicized kerfuffle with Cortés et al., have a different sort of twist on this othering. Not only are they depicted as irrational and superstitious, but they are envisioned as doing so in a self-defeating way. They cringe at shadows and stab themselves in the foot, literally, and are thus shown to be almost childish in comparison to hard-nosed, logical Europeans who have put aside childish things.

The truth of the matter is that while their were superstitions about birthdays in Mesoamerica, though these mostly were centered on the *trecenas* of the *tonalpohualli*, the 260 day calendar.^3 A child born during the Tochtli *trecena*, for example, was thought to be lucky, but with a tendency towards being a useless drunk. Those born in the period starting with 1 Acatl were thought to often be liars, while those born in the *trecena* of Quetzpalin were assumed to be brave. People born on Friday the 13th were considered to be unlucky, while those born on July 4th were considered exceptionally patriotic, and those born under the sign of Scorpio were good in the sack... wait, I think I've made some sort of comparison to prove a point.

So why even have these ""unlucky/lucky"" days? Not something I feel qualified to answer (though maybe a subject /u/itsallfolklore  might have a few words on). The point is to show that ascribing certain attributes to people based on their birthdates shades towards the ubiquitous. And yet, somehow, people born during certain *trecenas* or under certain astrological signs (or who are Iron Roosters, or born on a certain saint's day, or are Enneagram Type 6, INTJs, etc.) manage to get on with living their lives.

Really though, to think that these superstitions would so override the minds of the people in Mesoamerica to the point of mass murder of babies born during certain period is absurd to the point of insulting. This is particularly the case when you consider the way Nahuas viewed their children. A new baby was seen as a gift, referred to as jewels or quetzal plumes, and to bear a child was considered a woman's highest honor in life. Having a designated 5 day period wherein all those precious jewels were sacrificed simply doesn't make sense outside of sixth grade humbug.

False,0,,t5_2qh53,1,1,InfO_is_CRITICAL,Personally I have always loved history. But for a beginner I would say start with 1066 as it's the founding of basically modern Britain or the UK as they call it. That will lead you to a lot of how the world was shaped. Because England is consistantly a major power player through history. And they help to found America. And by 1066 starting there cover major historical events like the British loosing there crown to William the conqueror. Understand why and how these major events go on and why they happened. And you will be able to learn a lot quickly. But remember to always dabble not just in one time period it's best to cover them all but to fall in love with time period is inevitable. Mine is between 1100-1200-1650. Mainly due to my fascination with armored fighting religious fervor that swept Europe and the Italian city states such as Florence and Naples.

If he is referring to 'real professional army' in the sense of those like the US, Western Europe or China, then yes, we're not going to have a chance against those, but that's a rather pointless comparison.

I would like to say that you're the first person in this subthread that has implied or outright blamed the violence on racial diversity, but unfortunately that's not the case. 

Western Europe isn't an aberration. The United States is above the average homocide rates for Europe, Asia and Oceania. One of the most ethnically diverse countries on the face of the planet, Indonesia has a rate of 0.6 per 100,000 to America's 3.8, according to UNODC data. 

Sure there might be a deficiency in the data, but it's hard to imagine that it could be of a magnitude that would even put the two in the same league. 

Never once have I stated exactly what America should deal to deal with the situation, I'm just pointing out why current measure's don't work when people fall back to the usual ""but X city/state/county has gun control laws and they don't work"". EDIT: I did potentially suggest proper licensing laws. My bad. 

All I'm doing is pointing out that you guys have a problem and there's a large subsection of your society which argues that there is either no problem, the problem can't possibly be dealt with, or says that it shouldn't be fixed because the cultural cost would be too high.

Essentially it boils down to the high P/E ratio in the market today. The market is expensive, so returns should average lower over the next 10 years. I think it's a valid argument for the next 10 years, which will be my accrual years, but I'll reevaluate my withdrawal rate as I get closer to FI.

As for Europe, they haven't recovered from Greece, so i expect that to happen over the next few years. 

And as for Asia, China has had some instability in the last few months and I think that's because of unrealistic expectations priced into the market. Japan has had difficulty in tech (especially Sony), and I think their economy in general isn't going to boom anytime soon.

False,0,,t5_2qh1i,2,2,JLVD2,"Alright - I'll give you specific and concrete. But I don't think you're going to like it.

1) Abandon the idea of American exceptionalism. It's simple nonsense. America is one country among nearly two hundred. It is wealthier and more influential than most, it's geographically and demographically significant - but that does not mean it has a manifest destiny, it does not mean that it must lead the free world. Those ideas are ignorant, arrogant, and dangerous.

2) America should look to the example of western Europe. For fifty years, Western European nations have practiced, in one form or another, wide-scale democratic socialism. This will first mean that Americans will have to stop hearing ""totalitarian Stalinism"" every time someone says the word ""socialism.""

This has lead to happier, more productive populations, more engagement in the democratic process, and all-around higher standards of living. 

Concrete ideas to borrow from western europe:

a) VERY HIGH TAXES on the wealthy and on private corporations. As an addendum to this - close tax loopholes for the wealthy and on corporations. Re-regulate your banking system so the clusterfuck of stupidity and greed that caused the Great Depression and the 2008 Recession can never happen again.
b) The adoption of mixed-member proportional representation and the restructuring of the education system.
c) The complete overhaul of the education system, including hiring, training, and placing more teachers in classrooms to reduce classroom size, and incentivizing teaching as a profession by providing high wages and good benefits WHILE AT THE SAME TIME raising the standard of training we expect from public educators.
d) Incentivize the use of alternative energy sources and gradually phase out fossil fuels. this would have any number of benefits, economically (creating jobs) environmentally (reducing carbon emissions) geopolitically (stops funneling money into the hands of the  Saudis - which in turn stops funnelling arms and materiel into the hands of terrorists). 

e) Abandon the Second Amendment of the constitution. It's a ridiculous, backwards law that makes the rest of the world view you as ignorant barbaric rednecks - for good reason. No civilian population should have the ""RIGHT"" to own death machines. At the very least, that should be a privilege you earn through rigorous training and vetting.

3) A vigorous and thorough overhaul of the criminal justice system. Decriminalize (at the very least) harmless intoxicants like marijuana, ""magic mushrooms"", etc. Stop putting people in prison for victimless crimes. Abandon the death penalty (proven to be more costly than just keeping someone in prison for the rest of their lives.) Abandon for-profit prisons. Hold police accountable when they abuse their power. 

5) Stop the criminalization of the urban poor and people of colour. Focus on solving the problems of endemic poverty and racism through a combination of financial aid and education. 

6) Reinvest in science and technological development. Don't let a private corporation (even one founded by well-intentioned billionaires) be the first to plant a flag on Mars. Work with other nations to explore and discover.

Think of it as Lord of the Rings.

The Ottomans were engaged in a pitched battle against the combined armies of ~~The Men of the West~~ Europe.

Then, as the hour drew late, ~~someone said ""look to the East""~~, from the forest on the edge of the battlefield came riders - armor glistening in the sun, majestic winged-helmets, tough warhorses galloping.

They slammed the Ottoman flank, completely routing them.

Thus, the Ottoman's, at their peak, were halted on the gates of ~~Minas Tirith~~ Vienna.

-----------------

Another one that's historically important was the **Siege of Constantinople in 717-718**.

Now, around this time, Christianity hasn't gotten as much traction in the region compared to latter times. Also, the Bulgars and Byzantines have had conflicts in the past.

Both nations struck a deal, and faced off against a massive land-and-sea invasion from the Umayyads.

That leads to the Umayyad defeat, the preservation of Christianity, similar to what the OP attributed for the Battle of Tours.

------------------------

And finally, the **Battle of Poltava**.

Sweden was at the height of its power, led by a brilliant king; Russia, though vast, was still considered inferior compared to most armies in the west.

Charles XII was a tactical genius, and he viewed the battlefield like a hawk, able to make decisions at the most critical juncture.

However, a few days earlier, he was wounded in the leg. Because of this, he had no choice but to stay in his tent and delegate two of his generals. Separately, they may have been up to the task. Unfortunately, the two just *DID NOT* get along, at all.

The breakdown in communications and ineffective leadership led to Sweden's defeat.

Sweden's time as a Major Power would slowly fade, its expansion checked, and Russia would claim its place as the dominant power in the region.",history,cyk3mq3,0,,False,t3_3z7mae,t3_3z7mae,1451799345,,1454247241

Really it depends on your experience, career path, and starting location as to where and how often you move, it will vary from one person to the next. South America, the Mid East, Africa and Europe (i.e. Norway or UK) are fairly common.

As for where you can travel, it really depends on where companies can get you visas for, as much as the business need. It's most likely that you would start in your home country (just because it requires no initial visa expenditure in terms of fees, processing time and legal assistance on the part of the company), and then move abroad later. For example I started in the UK and after a year and 4 months or so was moved across to the US.

Some notes based on my own knowledge -

1 - The Weimar Republic was stained from day one by the ""Stab in the Back"" legend.

The story goes something like this.  Germany was (for all appearances) *winning the war*.  German propaganda told the population that everything was going great.  The German's had successfully knocked Russia out of the war and gain HUGE swathes of land in Eastern Europe.  France and England were both exhausted from the war.  Perhaps most importantly *German troops were in enemy territory*.  Germany was not under direct attack... they were attacking.

Then... out of seemingly nowhere... overnight Germany loses.  Overnight they go from ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" to ""we lost and have to pay a shit load of money and give land back and by the way they are going to gut our [again seemingly successful] military like a fish"".

So a myth grew up, support by many of the leaders of the German military who wanted blame to fall elsewhere.  This myth was the ""Stab in the Back"".  In goes that a group of people, primarily the Social Democrats, Jews and some other groups stabbed the military in the back and gave up.

And lo and behold, post war who is in power... the Social Democrats.  They sold out Germany for their own power!!!! 

2 - The Weimar Republic wasn't able to save Germany from the consequences of the war.

Shit was *bad* after the war.  Initially Germany tried to honor its obligations, to try and prove that it was actually willing to be a part of Europe... but Germany couldn't keep up.  The already shattered Germany economy was further smashed by crushing war reparations and debts from the war.... and then the Great Depression hit them full in the teeth.

To keep it brief, Iranian is an umbrella term for many different peoples (modern Persians, Afghans, Kurds, Tajiks etc etc and also ancient peoples like the Persians, Medians, Parthians, Dahae, Sakae etc etc.). In other words, Persians are Iranian but not all Iranians are persian (like no all christians are Catholic).

Like all indoeuropeans, Iranians are Aryan and migrated from the caucasus. Persians are a specific subgroup of Iranians that eventually settled in the Fars/Pars province of modern SW Iran. They were not steppe nomads any more than the Babylonians, Assyrians, or Romans of the time were.

In case you forgot, Saudi Arabia produces oil that flows into Europe and Asia (America's oil demand is almost entirely met by North American production) and keeps those economies running smoothly. 

This is the middle east, where everyone kills dissidents. Assad kills hundreds of them every month (including children) with his barrel bombs, the Iranians hang people from cranes all the time for things that are not even crimes in most parts of the world, even the Israelis kill Palestinians for sport on the thinest pretexts. It's not pretty, but as long as the region is dominated by authoritarian and absolutist institutions and ideologies it's an unpleasant fact of life. If you let the House of Saud fall, odds are that their successors would be even more brutal due to the lack of decades of American influence on them; the Saudi royalty send their children to US and European universities, whereas their likely successors in the event of a successful revolution would have been educated in a madrassa.. 

The Saudis are important in maintaining a free part of the world, even if they aren't part of it. Imagine a world without a democratic and liberal Europe for a moment, and you'll see that the boundaries of the free world have shrunken considerably.

Anyways, we continue through Asia until we get to China and North Korea.  This is where we tell them that we must cooperate as we have a common enemy, the US. with the might of China, the middle East, Africa, and Europe, we take over Japan and use it as a Pacific command center.  We now pull a Japan and begin surprise attacks on island nations.  At this point I feel is should make it clear that I would try very hard to avoid war atrocities, as I aim to pick up followers in each new conquest.  I would send teams into Australia to meet in secret with the Aboriginals and convince them that if they ally themselves with me, true equality will take place on the continent, with the Aboriginal people receiving reparations from the whites.  From here it should be fairly easy to take over New Zealand.  Then I sail the majority of my fleet acquired from conquered countries to South America, making similar promises to those mentioned previously.  March north to central America, and Mexico.  Make deals with the cartels for them to invade the US from the south alongside my own troops.  This is going to be one of the hardest fights, considering tons of people own guns.  This is when we will be using the bulk of the Chinese and North Korean militaries.  So let's say by some miracle we did it.  Now all that is left is Canada and Russia.  Now we choke Russia, coming from east, west, and south.  Hopefully, all goes well and we reach Moscow from all 3 sides at roughly the same time.

Still wont stop eastern europeans in NATO countries as far as Poland crying about how Russia will try to take them over any day now to rally something or other.

We all know Russia cant take over any European nation as the insurgency of holding a country of people who don't want you is what loses wars in the long run. Hell the biggest military in the world couldn't even control a country the size of Iraq in a trillion dollar war.

The problem I think a lot of people had with Ep. 1-3 wasn't that they were terrible (though they didn't do a lot right), it's that they didn't reproduce the nostalgia people wanted for Star Wars.

JJ Abrams knew he wasn't ever going to make the hardcore fans happy. So he threw out all of the EU and decided to make a film that focused on the memory of watching the original series. He used the same tropes and plotlines to establish the same feeling. 

Maybe you liked it, maybe you didn't, but either way it did what Disney wanted it to, and judging by the amount of people seeing it, it did what most fans wanted it to do too.",StarWars,cyk5xx7,0,,False,t1_cyk5pn1,t3_3z73s8,1451804634,,1454248402

The structure of the above statement can be expressed as ""If A's are as bad as B's, then maybe B's are morally justified."" Frankly I don't see how you CAN'T understand how I ""arrived"" at exactly what you said. You're the one putting words in my mouth sir, not the other way around.

&gt;You compared Israel to Nazi Germany 

yeah

&gt;and my examples illustrated how absurd that comparison is.

how exactly? 

&gt;No it's not a fairly accurate comparison - it's asinine.

Interesting opinion

&gt;You know damn well that comparing a the treatment of a minority with 1.5 million citizens and 13 Palestinian Arabs in Parliament 

Nazi Germany had one of the highest Jewish populations in all of Europe at the start of WWII, and here's a list of Germanic Jews, many who lived through Nazi Germany. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_Jews#Politicians 

While it's true that Jewish officials were mostly excoriated from office during the second world war, that says very little about the plight of the average Germanic Jew compared to the average Israeli Arab. 

&gt;to a regime which systematically exterminated the Jewish minority in gas chambers is vile.

""Vile"" huh. Where would you be without your moral bloviating? 

While it's true that Nazi Germany killed many millions more Jews than Jews are killing Arabs in death camps, their treatment is otherwise very similar. 

There have been millions of acres of land seized, tens of thousands of homes demolished, thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli ""prison camps,"" and about 10,000 Palestinian citizens killed since 2000. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_casualties_of_war#1948.E2.80.932012

Now none of this is to make an exact comparison to Nazi Germany, but I only mean to show that there are enough similarities to draw a fair comparison. 

But I think we both know that you and your moral indignation won't be satisfied unless it is shown that Israel is EXACTLY Nazi Germany. I'd wager you'd be okay with comparing Israel to a thousand other nations which oppressed their own citizens, but not with Nazi Germany. You have to avoid THAT specific comparison at all costs, and I think we both know why.",worldnews,cyk66kk,0,,1451961328,t1_cyk579f,t3_3z3om6,1451805282,,1454248515

False,0,2,t5_2s46m,2,2,H0kusai,"You've already got the essential advice about stainless steel razors and better brushes, but let me ask some questions about your assumptions. 

If you primarily want to replace your hardware with better stuff, just carry on buying, but if you primarily want a better shave, you really should get a decent soap first. As already mentioned, TOBS is one of the traditional British grooming brands that had their shaving soaps  utterly ruined by reformulation. They are simply unfit for shaving. You can get cheap mass market soaps like Palmolive sticks that are much better. Higher level mass market products like L'Occitane Cade shaving soap or cream will feel like a luxurious revelation in comparison. Then you have the really excellent British shaving soaps that still survive, like D.R.Harris. And then there is the artisan sector that has been emerging in recent years, especially in the US (I suspect that is because of the relative lack of decent or even very good traditional mass market products as compared to Europe.)

A Merkur razor showing wear after only one year strikes me as odd - I have been using my grandfather's Merkur Progress that he bought in the fifties and used for thirty years. It has slight wear at the exposed edge of the bars, not from shaving, but from being stored unprotected in a bathroom drawer for a decade before I found it. It is still in perfect working order. Are you sure it isn't soap scum on the chrome plating?

And one last thing: A relative newbie who uses Feather blades raises a red flag. Many who start out wet shaving are under the impression that Feather blades are somehow special and objectively better than other brands. Understandably, as there is quite some hype around that brand, but they are not. While there are objective criteria (at least to a degree) to judge the build quality of razors and brushes and the lather making properties of soaps, blades are an utterly personal matter. While there are some brands that many seem to agree work at least decently, that doesn't work for all. All you can do is test different blade brands and trust your own judgement. 
The classic text with the reasons behind that advice:
https://leisureguy.wordpress.com/2007/08/07/a-disquisition-on-blade-sampler-packs/
Tryablade.com is a good source for samplers. 

TL;DR: Don't waste money on better hardware without fixing the obvious problems. Supplant the sub par soap first, as it would ruin the experience of even the best razor. Make sure you sample enough blade brands and test them again in every new razor. Then invest in all the nice stuff you desire. ",wicked_edge,cyk6hdh,0,Occam’s Razor,1451807901,t3_3z7zoa,t3_3z7zoa,1451806109,,1454248657

La dus a fost surge de 2.5x si am considerat ca a fost rezonbil. Era noaptea de revelion, era un drum relativ scurt, nu aveam alta optiune. M-au pus sa introduc cu degetele mele 2 si 5 intr-o interfata identica cu cea din stanga. Mi-au dat si optiunea sa astept sa treaca surge-ul. Alternativa ar fi fost sa intarzii la petrecere. 


La 4 dimineata, surge-ul era la 7x. Aveam de ales intre a merge mai bine de o ora prin frig, a plati probabil 105 RON pe cursa sau a ramane in camera de oaspeti a oamenilor la care am fost. Am ramas in camera de oaspeti. Daca n-ar fi fost optiunea asta, as fi platit 105 RON la Uber si as fi fost recunoscator ca nu trebuie sa merg o ora prin frig. Nu-i vina companiei ca eu nu mi-am proiectat eu seara in asa fel incat sa am cu ce sa ma intorc.

False,0,,t5_2s5oq,1,1,latigidigital,"&gt; While bush was an idiot and created a lot of messes, its not fair to not recognize all of the messes that Obama was responsible for.  

Bush and his administration caused untold damage, well beyond any mess or controversy. The extent of domestic and diplomatic damage has no comparison in American history, not including the harm to Iraq or the Middle East or Europe.

&gt; Like when people blame the deficit on bush but don't bother to check to see that the debt has increased steadily the whole time Obama has been in office

The occasion was already set into action by his predecessors, mostly Bush and to a lesser extent Clinton's banking deregulation.

Yes, Obama could have handled it better, but only by doing the things that his detractors oppose: raising (especially corporate) taxes and closing loopholes, rolling out massive public work projects, increasing funding to branches of the government that stimulate economic growth, and curbing income disparity through wage increases and stimulus packages to the public.

&gt; we've had two ""shutdowns"" and numerous near shutdowns

The blame for those tantrums rests with the people who, with no regard for patriotism or shame, decided that a few minor political issues were worth tarnishing the reputation of our nation. If Obama has any blame in these events, it's for not making massive asses out of everyone involved until they were backed into resigning their seats or making public apologies.

&gt; obamacare crashing and burning 

Again, this is on a certain group of people who thought that letting their constituents and neighbors unnecessarily die of diseases was worth making a minor political point.

I live in a state where millions were robbed of their chance at healthcare, and it's everything I can do to contain my feelings on the matter after having seen so many people suffer to death from treatable cancers, have teeth slowly rot out of their mouths, live with stage III hypertension, unmanaged diabetes, and an assortment of other horrible maladies that shouldn't exist in a first world nation.

&gt; and being exposed as a tax 

It was a tax before the ACA, too — just not one that was as visible. When you don't take care of people, they end up in the emergency room for much more morbid conditions than they started out with, and then they still can't pay the bill. But somebody does — and that somebody is you. The increased costs are offset into insurance premiums and Medicare payments.

&gt; instead of the great solution to the healthcare crisis it was sold as, etc.

Yes, it was a disappointment compared to what it should have been. Obama sold everyone short when he stepped back from the public option. But even then, it was never anything more than a temporary solution because nothing short of a single payer system will reign in costs.

&gt; Granted a lot of this is the fault of the shitshow that the Senate is and has been for quite some time. 

Yep, it's been a real problem for a few decades now. The only people who are allowed to survive primaries are corrupt, courtesy of the 1976 Supreme Court ruling. And they just doubled down on it again twice in the past decade. There probably aren't a dozen straight shooting politicians in Congress right now, regardless of party or agenda, because it's a [near statistical certainty that the candidate with the most money wins](http://letsfreecongress.org) at this point. Also, let us not forget a media that has forsaken its duty to the public — ABC, CBS, CNN, and MSNBC are all too busy with entertainment to cover meaningful political stories, local newspapers have almost all been bought out by the same national companies, and meanwhile FOX marches on [deliberately misleading](http://www.businessinsider.com/study-watching-fox-news-makes-you-less-informed-than-watching-no-news-at-all-2012-5) its captive audience of conservative folks who aren't paying close attention or just don't know any better.

&gt; But Obama is just a different kind of shitty. And if we're OK with blaming bush for the shitty things congress did while he was in office, then we have to be willing to hold Obama to the same standard.

He has done plenty of shitty. Suspending habeas corpus, continuing a program of torture, tolerating a signature strike program so horrifically executed that people resign after being assigned to it, moving forward with an intelligence program in violation of the Fourth Amendment, accidentally on purpose executing Americans abroad, and more or less leaving almost all of his supporters short of expectations.

But if we want to look at it objectively, aside those egregious examples, he has done more positive than negative by volume, and overall put the country back on the right track.",LifeProTips,cyk72tq,0,,1451811163,t1_cyk4ax3,t3_3z39sd,1451807943,,1454248938

Sure, as a thought experiment.

But the thing is, there's no need to speculate.
We have the data needed, and it's extremely telling.

Some ~320 million people and ~10000 shot and killed each year.

Depending on definition EU / Euope has between 600 and 740 million people. 
Numbers are a little harder to come by, but if we're very pessimistic let's say 1000 people are shot and killed each year. (And I'd say the number is really half that)

So it's 15 - 20 times as likely for an American to be shot by a countryman, as it is for a European.

I was actually thinking about the subject of voting earlier today. About how feminists always bring it up as a major talking point, when if you really think about it, it doesn't really have any validity and overall it's really not a good point.         
It's always brought up as ""Women weren't able to vote"", implying that men were, when in reality men weren't allowed to vote either. Many countries outside of the Western Europe and the United States granted all their citizens, men and women, the right to vote at the same time, and it usually coincided with abolition of monarchy, aristocracy, dictatorship and so on.  Even in the United States the right to vote for men wasn't [guaranteed until 1870](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage#United_States), when the 15th Amendment was passed. And then in 1920 the 19th Amendment was passed, guaranteeing women the right to vote.           
So really, when feminists talk about ""not being able to vote"", at least as far as the United States is concerned, they are talking about a 50 year period, which is unfair, I'll agree, but not really all that bad in historical context.

Orange Tesla is supposedly in the range of 220-269mg tested, you can find the reports on the European party safe sites but gotta dig em up. I believe Red Audis are in range of 200-220mg.

False,0,,t5_2qnp7,20,20,sadsfae,"* What is your job description? What do you do exactly?

Sr. Sysadmin.  I guess sometimes we're called 'Systems Engineers' but that seems like title inflation.  I manage server, switch, storage infrastructure, large internal/external OpenStack clouds and write tooling (Python/Shell), automation. I break a lot of stuff.  Sometimes I [write blog posts and guides](http://hobo.house/category/open-source/) about Linux admin things.

* What kind of and how many users do you have?

Most of the people who use my infrastructure are R&amp;D software engineers and the general public for facing/external stuff we support (OpenStack).  We have several hundred internal engineering users and around 10-20k external public users, based on accounts created within [Trystack.org](http://trystack.org) as an example of one of the free, public upstream service I help maintain.

* What software do you use?

100% Linux shop.  Mostly everything.. e.g. Foreman for provisioning/utility, ansible and puppet for config management, shared git repositories for ops tooling/code and shared credentials (encrypted via GPG).  Nagios for monitoring, graphite/grafana (collectd) for graphing/metrics, ELK for log aggregation.  On the personal computing side I use Fedora Linux, [XFCE with KWIN](http://hobo.house/2015/08/14/using-kwin-with-xfce/), a lot of vim, mutt, screen, sed, awk, shell, ssh, etc.

* How do you manage clients and users?

Automate everything where possible.  [Foreman](http://theforeman.org/) helps tremendously with tying utility services together and ansible and puppet are great for configuration management.  I also try to vehemently document everything and [write tooling](https://github.com/sadsfae/misc-scripts) to cover repeatable tasks.

* What hardware do you directly interact with?

Lots of Dell servers, Force10 10/40GbE switches, Juniper switches, Brocade FC, Netapp arrays. 

Home office: I use a Dell Precision workstation with 2 x 23"" monitors running Fedora Linux and a Lenovo x240 running Fedora when I travel (which seems to be fairly often).

* How many people are working with you?

I'm a very small team, only two other people work with me on the (dev)ops side (1 x Australia, 1 x U.S - I'm in Europe).  Our reporting chain/group has several hundred software engineers however.

* What's your usual day in the office/data center/homeoffice like in ≤160 characters?

Wake up around noon, get drunk before the day begins.. before my mother starts bitching about my friends.

I usually start with email and mailing lists, [mutt makes this easy](http://hobo.house/2015/09/09/take-control-of-your-email-with-mutt-offlineimap-notmuch/).  I collaborate with internal/external folks via IRC and pick up anything needing to be done in our RT ticketing system based on what my IRC bot announces in our internal channels.

I'll check grafana for any [interesting trends](https://github.com/sadsfae/trystack-collectd) throughout the day, maybe write new tooling or automation as the needs arise.. but most of all I try to take none of it too seriously and have a good time while producing good results.  I work remote 90% of the time, all my systems and infrastructure are in other countries.  I usually have 2-3 longer-running projects or deployments all the time alongside day-to-day ops work.

However, depending on how much of your trip is set in stone, you might want to consider changing your destinations.  Western Europe is culturally much more similar to the US than places like Morocco, and traveling through those countries is easier (although more expensive).  Things like hostelworld and transportation systems are not as accessible in Morocco, and the different way of live can be really overwhelming if you aren't used to stepping out of your comfort zone.  Definitely go to all the places you're looking at eventually, but try ramping up from familiar places to new adventures.


With 2 months of travel time be sure to take things slowly.  Keep your calm and everything will work out in awesome ways.  Meet people, go new places, experience new things.  If you're lost or stuck in some random town, great - go buy some ice cream, read a book, and think about next steps.  Worst case scenario, you book a room in a hostel for a night.  Think about your needs and make sure they are met, everything else will fall into place.  I anticipate that early in your trip you'll quickly realize you have nothing to worry about and will fall into a good groove.

From my amateur historian's point of view, Australia has the old *continuous* culture: the culture of the Aboriginal people of Australia was the same for tens of thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans in 1788. Meanwhile, in Europe, the culture changed periodically: from hunter-gather to agricultural, from city-state to feudalism, and so on. China has a good claim for a long-standing continuous culture - from the founding of Imperial China in 221BC until the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949AD (nearly 2,200 years). Some African cultures were disrupted by the arrivals of European settlers during the [Age of Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery).

Culture is about the changes in civilisation that humans make, not about the existence of humans in a location, or their evolution. And it just so happens that the culture in Australia stayed stable for longer than in any other region.

I can assure you that is not the case. Europe's worst kinds of people are really pretty run of the mill here.*

*Thinking it this way, Europeans are quite a bit like a world of domesticated dogs, America is more like a world of coyotes. It's really what all the uproar about this immigration thing in Europe is all about, that because Europe has been so domesticated and pacified like a chihuahua or something, it doesn't even realize that playing with Wolves is not like playing with another domesticated dog and the bigger dogs keep warning that that's a really bad idea but the chihuahuas don't believe the bigger more realistic dogs until the chihuahua's head is bitten off. It's about the ability to realize threats and reality without living in la la land. The thing people don't get about the USA is that it is still a place where we respect and live within the boundaries of the reality of human nature and don't try to fantasize away reality. Reality is that there are people who are not good people to have in society and they need to be kept away from those who desire to live a civil and peaceful life. Other western countries really don't get that, e.g., in Europe where there is still a certain primitive rule of the strongest and lax policing and assurance of people's rights to look be peacefully at best.*

*Just because the USA jails people for what you perceive as minor offenses, doesn't mean that the offenses don't happen in other western countries where the crooks and offenders simple are let to get away. I would bet, if you live in Europe, you can think of situations where you or someone you know was victimized and the perpetrator / assailant was not caught or arrested or was barely punished enough to justify the cost and time spent on punishing him[.](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3sedpp/til_that_the_us_prison_population_is_about_25/cwwk9um)*

The EU is a  small continent where almost every country has agreed on gun restrictions. Australia and the UK are islands. The US has a massive Southern border with Mexico that we cannot close. Mexico is run by cartels, and it's mot going to have useful gun restrictions (they have restrictions, but since the cops are either corrupt or cartel themselves the laws are useless). There is a land route, besides the Panama Canal, going all the way from the bottom of South America up to Mexico. _Those_ countries can't effectively ban guns either.

Honestly, I feel like restrictions are at a good point as is. The problem is we are so fucking incapable of keeping guns out of criminal hands, in part because we have miles and miles of unguarded land that people can carry weapons in through.

Some matchups are easier for certain classes or players but the game itself is well balanced 1v1 (at 50 at least).

Anyone complaining about a class probably just doesn't know how to fight them and is just taking out their frustration. Although to be fair, LBM is a bit strong at level 45 cap with the level 50 skill patch so NA/EU players may be complaining about that. Most likely though they still just dont know the matchup. Even if LBM is a little strong theres still very few players that can take advantage of their strength enough to beat everyone else because of it.

C9 can't upgrade much in the way of an IGL, most likely they will have a slight downgrade simply to no better IGL than Sean being available. Liquid got a flat out upgrade, without question.
C9 is almost certainly not the best team in NA right now and like I said, bringing a new IGL in(even if he is a strong upgrade like pronax) is much, much harder than bringing a new AWPer in. C9 would need to somehow get a massive improvement to their roster which looking at the state of free agents is unlikely. The only options to make their roster even to Liquid again would be to pick up pronax or gob b, both seem quite unlikely considering the circumstances.

False,0,,t5_2qhcv,6,6,p7r,"OK, first of all: calm down. Your tone isn't helpful.

Firstly, this is attempted murder. Somebody nicking something out of your garden shed, you might let fly. Bit of a tussle in a pub? Might want to keep it out of the papers. Somebody going through your bins? Probably more hassle than its worth, buy a shredder.

But in this case, he is saying somebody tried to assassinate him. Do you not think it odd that he is not interested in identifying who that is?

If somebody is trying to assassinate the leader of the party that got 3.8m votes at the last election _I want to know who it is_ because it's completely unacceptable and they need to be in prison. We can't let things like this just pass us by, even if we disagree with that party's policies: as part of a sane liberal democracy, we should all stand up, pay attention and ask who the fuck would do this and bring them to account.

But he's not interested. So, fine, we don't get to do that.

And then there is the police not being interested. That's shocking. I can't imagine if that incident happened to me that the police would not want to follow up on who had endangered my life. So why did they not in this case? Why would the local authorities not know that a leader of a UK political party and member of the European Parliament was almost assassinated on their streets, and why would they not care?

Occam's razor says the only answers that make sense is that he has been a little liberal with the truth here, and the situation was not quite how it's been described.

&gt; You don't disagree with almost all of his and UKIP's policies because you don't know them.

I read the UKIP manifesto before the last general election. I read all the manifestos of the major parties. I talk to people about their policies regularly, because I live in an area where Labour (which I obviously am a supporter of) and UKIP lock horns from time to time. Whilst I am a member of a political party, I am interested in understanding the issues that people care about across the political spectrum, I simply disagree with the prioritisation of the problem and the proposed solutions.

Unlike you, I have not lowered myself to personal abuse: I simply disagree with UKIP's stance. I am not ""a twat"" just because I don't agree with UKIP and its policies. The fact you think everybody who disagrees with those policies is ""a twat"" shows how much your political insight is worth.",ukpolitics,cykah9l,0,Labour🌹,False,t1_cyk9v5o,t3_3z76s4,1451821859,,1454250540
False,0,points ,t5_2w2s8,2,2,Ipsey,"Part of it is the environment you typically work in; especially if you do a lot of work with computers (like graphic design). 

Most modern American offices and living spaces are designed to be used with artificial lighting. This combined with the light of the computer can cause eye strain as your eyes are forced to stare at artificial light for extended periods of time. This is the reason why we invented things like Night Mode for RES and f.lux for computers - it reduces eye strain. Before I got flux if I sat up at night on my computer in the States my eyes would start to burn if I looked at the computer too long - even with glasses on. 

I moved to Europe a few years back and noticed I didn't need my glasses as much because the buildings and offices here are all designed to utilize natural light as much as possible to save money. I started wearing my glasses only when I needed them because I could see fine without them. I recently got a new pair after five years and discovered that my eyesight had actually improved because I wasn't working in such dim conditions and didn't need my glasses as much. 

In contrast, my mother didn't need glasses until her late 40s; as she continues to live and work in the states her eyesight has only gotten worse over time (age may also be a factor). Her house is dim with only some natural light getting in through two windows; whereas in my home office the window takes up half of the outside wall.

Either the mods are capable of discussing the editorialisation internally and judging whether it is made in good faith (I see at least one german-speaking mod in the list), but are not willing to do so (for whatever reason) in which case we need some change in the moderation team.

Or the mods do not have the resources or manpower to deal with this kind of issue, in which case there is a clear need for more mods with different language capabilities. 

In both cases there needs to be more communication and transparency on the part of the mods. This is a regional default subreddit and the quality of moderation should reflect it!

Great excitement in Wrocław, which will be European capital of culture next year: as new culture Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Piotr Gliński had tried Kaczyński's, to prevent the premiere of Elfriede Jelinek's play death and the maiden  directed by Ewelina Marciniak. Of course he stand up for the freedom of art, however, pornography on the stage will be to see, and that does not go well once, so put it in a letter to the lower Silesian voivode Gliński.

&gt;Culture Minister Piotr Gliński had announced only a few hours after his inauguration, the State media in ""national cultural institutions"" to convert and the regional newspapers, the largely German publishers belonged to renationalise. Who do not pull with would be with.

You were the one who brought up getting golden Tinkmaster at the beginning of season 1, which is exactly the time he was nerfed. I assumed you were referring to that. If it was just to give detailed information, but you didn't actually disenchant him for full value because you got him either too early or too late for that, then I apologise for misunderstanding your point. In that case, just replace my Scion's third Wish example with ""a guy who found 8 legendaries in his first 20 packs"" which is significantly more likely, and more evenly distributed among the playerbase, than a golden legendary in HS.

&gt;I disagree. Ive been playing Hearthstone since season one on NA, and on EU and Asia since Naxx came out. Ive gotten multiple golden legendaries on all 3 servers. The golden legendary drop rate is 1 in 14, a little over 7%. I dont even have 14 legendaries total on EU, but I still have 2 goldens (dont have the non-goldens to disenchant).

And I disagree with your point and argue that you were lucky. You get 1 golden legendary in about 270 packs on average. If you look at the distribution, this means that about half of the people who got 200 packs have found a golden legendary in it. 

I would argue that probably most of the playerbase has not opened more than 200 packs. This part is just an assumption, I'm not sure if there's any official stats that can be used to estimate it, but 200 packs takes about a year of diligent every day daily questing, and since most people are either f2p or maybe occasionally spend real money on just a few packs, not 200, I doubt that a majority has opened 200 packs.

So I stand by my point that most people probably haven't seen a single golden legendary in a pack.

&gt;I think the unlucky rates do matter for Duelyst because its heavily advertised, and when a casual player is unlucky and goes 15 without a legendary when they should have hit 4 already, its going to cause frustration and resentment

I agree, it's important from a psychological standpoint and I'm completely in favour of implementing something similar, because in a game with a 1 in 4 rate, it's extremely frustrating to go 15 packs without one (I know from experience). I just don't think it does much to improve Hearthstone's standing in a cost of entry comparison, since we're talking about a number of packs where HS's guaranteed legendary doesn't kick in yet. And going 40 orbs without one is so unlikely that I doubt it happened to anyone. And in the rare case where we do have actually that one new player who was so unlucky, I doubt that a HS player who opened 40 packs and only got a Millhouse or Hemet is actually better off. Sure, he got 400 dust, but he probably would've profited more off the higher spirit per pack rate on commons in Duelyst than what he gained from his legendary. So even the unlucky people aren't actually better off in HS when it comes to cost of entry.",duelyst,cykaqvc,0,,1451823860,t1_cyk9jxg,t3_3z8vvf,1451823056,,1454250666
