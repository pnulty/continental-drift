grandorder,"Altria Pendragon (Alter - Lancer)

The King of Knights of the Round Table that is described in legends.
In reality a lovely girl-knight, and yet possesses both purity and integrity just like in legends.
She is known as a holy sword-user, but the holy spear she possesses is actually quite powerful as well, making possible to manifest as a Lancer. 

According to differing opinions, when manifesting as a Lancer, the King of Knights is said to take a figure that differs ""in portion"" to what she was while alive. Whatever that is because the body of eternal youth has grown ""in portion"" due to possessing the holy spear instead of the holy sword and scabbard, or because the magical power of the spear made ""a portion"" of the body grow---

Even if she exchanges the holy sword for the sacred spear, the mentality of the King of Knights does not change. She still is the same King of Knights who became a king by acquiring the sword of selection, who opposed assailing foreign enemies, monsters and occasionally even dragons and continued to fight to protect her homeland.
She will probably become of assistance to the Master in regards the restoration of human history.

Height/Weight: 154cm・42kg?
Source: Arthurian Legends
Region: Europe
Alignment: Lawful Good
Gender: Female
There are various opinions about the body weight or figure from when she is a Lancer.

NOBLE PHANTASM

Rhongomynyad - The Spear that Shines in the Far Away
Rank: A++
Type: Anti-Fort
Holy spear. Also known as Ron.*
Regarded in the same light as the Holy Lance Longinus that pierced the messiah, around the 1st Century AD.
When releasing the True Name, both Rank and classification change.

Originally, this holy spear is the ""pillar of light"" that fasten together the two sides of the world (reality and illusions) itself, and it has been said that, in the unlikely event that this is undone, reality will be tear off from the world.
Being the ""king"" that stood at the final moments of illusion and the Age of Gods, she possesses this holy spear that conceals such tremendous power.

By releasing the True Name, the holy spear will emit a fragment of the power of the light that shines in the far away.
In order to perform this release of the True Name, there is a need to lift at least half of a total of thirteen restrains. Supposedly such property is equivalent to that of the ""holy sword of the star that saves the world"".

self,"2015 was absolutely ridiculous. I went to Europe for the first time and visited Berlin, Prague, Switzerland and Amsterdam with my friends over the summer. I made some new friends and it was all going well. 

And then the second half hit me hard. The girl I'd proposed to, and was thinking of going forward to marriage with by next year, and I broke up in truly a ground shattering way. It was a 4 yr relationship, and even 4 months after the breakup, I'm still not able to smile genuinely. A day after the breakup, I failed the exam that would have given me my professional career designation and moved me wayyyyy up. A month after that, I got into a car crash from which I don't know how I walked out. Car was totally destroyed. (Got a new car after) A month after that, I got laid off from the job I'd gotten after graduation. (Got a new job after)

For 2016, I want to turn things around in the following ways: 

1. Be confident in my career choice and move to this new company.

2. Complete that exam that I previously failed and just be DONE.

3. Meet new girls (possibly get into another relationship) and just make new friends who I can do normal things (not just get drunk, or get high) with.

&gt; Savage Republic was a seminal Los Angeles Tribal-Industrial-Art-Punk band from the 1980s, currently reformed and active with a different line-up. They were influenced by a diverse array of music, including Glenn Branca, Can, DNA, Amon Duul, PiL, The Pop Group, Joy Division, Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, The Ventures and Flipper, as well as a variety of ethnic music from around the world. Their sound and aesthetic approach resonated alongside contemporaries such as Einstürzende Neubauten, Sonic Youth and the Butthole Surfers.

&gt; In 2005 Savage Republic reformed, albeit without ""leader"" Bruce Licher, touring the U.S. west coast. The band now consists of post-1983 ""core"" members Greg Grunke, Thom Fuhrmann and Ethan Port, as well as drummer Sterling Fox (who performed in several post-Savage Republic projects with this trio). The massive Glenn Branca-inspired guitar shimmering still remains.

&gt; In Jan 2006 Savage Republic co-headlined the Los Angeles ""How to Destroy the Universe - Part 5"" festival with Blixa Bargeld.

&gt; In 2007 Alan Waddington joined as permanent drummer. 

&gt; ""1938"", their first studio album in nearly two decades, was released on Neurot Recordings in October 2007.

&gt; Val Haller joined Savage Republic on the 2008 European tour and recorded tracks for the 1983 album. 

&gt; Jack Housen joined Savage Republic on the 2009 European tour. 

&gt; In 2010 Kerry Dowling replaced Greg Grunke. 

&gt; The lineup of Fuhrmann, Dowling, Waddington and Port  toured several more times in the US and Europe, and worked on several new albums. 

&gt; The album ""Varvakios"" was released in 2013 on LTM records

&gt; The album ""Aegean"" was released Feb,  2014.  Read more on Last.fm.

politics,"&gt; Ugh. The point is that human deaths and injuries are caused by fire arms.

The point is, if your position is a valid one, then you should be able to argue for it using truthful numbers. 2/3rds of ""violence"" stats being suicide is not being truthful.

When you use those numbers, people rightfully assume you mean homicide. And to that end you would be right, the USA does have a homicide problem, compared to many other countries. There is a point to be made there.

The same [cannot be said about the USA's suicide rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate). Despite guns practically falling out of every cupboard in the nation, the suicide rate is right on par with most of europe, and far lower than many countries that ban guns entirely. It is much harder to make the USA's suicide rate(which, while never nice, is not abnormal in any way) a ""gun problem"".

And even if it was, listing it as ""violence"" is still stupid, and clearly manipulative.

When you say ""there is X gun violence in the USA"" and your solutions are things that have exactly zero chance of affecting over 2/3rds of that number, then you are doing it wrong. Assault weapons bans, armor piercing ammo bans, magazine limits sure as hell have nothing to do with suicide. Even more rational measures to combat violence like background checks(which already exist in some form), etc have little chance of affecting that number. Few measures are actually aimed at suicide, which is unfortunate.

&gt; It's obvious that some nonzero percentage of the people who kill themselves with fire arms every year wouldn't kill themselves if they didn't have easy access to a gun

Possibly, but countries like canada and australia saw method substitution pretty much make up for any difference in gun suicides after increased controls.

&gt; People like you don't have anything to contribute to that discussion so you make

I have plenty to contribute, chances are I know a lot more about the issue than you do, but i dont have to lay that all out in every 3 sentence comment.

If you want suicide to be part of the discussion, thats all well and good. Using it to sneakily triple your numbers while people think the discussion is on homicide isnt. Especially when what may fix one thing ill likely have nothing to do with the other.

The truth is, a lot of measures being pushed would have a lot less support if they used realistic numbers.

For instance the assault weapons ban. ""30,000 dead! Ban AR15's now!""

Well, 22,000 of those are suicide or accidents, which has nothing to do with a specific kind of rifle. Of the remaining 8500 actual gun homicides, about 250 use a rifle of any kind. Of that 3% of gun homicides a significantly smaller portion will be AR 15's.

Being generous, that number is now 50(taking a wild guess, its hard to find numbers breaking down into specific types of rifle and there are many. But i heard about 20% of rifles being sold today are AR15 pattern, hence 50. Realistically they make up less than 20% due to how many others have been produced in the use over the centuries.). You could honestly say "" approx 50 deaths a year by AR15's! Ban them!""

Of course, out of 330 million people, that number is pretty darn small. And even then, your measures couldnt be relied on to remove the 50, most would simply just be committed with a different gun just as well, even assuming all the AR15's vanished instantly.

Hence, why the inflated 30,000 number is trotted out to push for stuff like the assault weapons ban, despite probably 99.9% being totally unrelated to the measures you are supporting.


There is room for improvement in the USA's system. Some of the things we do here in canada might help.

But there is a whole lot of nonsense both in the legislation in place, and used to push for further legislation that is not helping anyone.

The quickest way for the USA to lower it's numbers of gun related deaths would be to focus on suicide prevention, mental healthcare, etc to go after the 22,000 suicides. Work on measures that can fairly remove guns and other methods of harm from suicidal people, with due process to return them once they are no longer a risk.

The next step would be to go after gang related killings which make up a large percentage of the remaining percentage of gun homicides(ive seen figures for 80% of chicago's homicides for instance). ",cyhxpjp,0,,False,t1_cyhvsj8,t3_3ywoff,1454209877,,1451614602,,False,0,t5_2cneq,diablo_man,1,1

changemyview,"I agree with some parts of this and not others.  Looking over the six core movies and the rest of the EU, it's clear that GL's strengths and weaknesses were extremely well pronounced.  He was extremely good at universe building, creating lore, and the practical aspects of movie-making (like designing sets).  He was markedly poor at the artistic, personable aspects of filmmaking.  You can even see it it in the original trilogy.  While RoTJ looked and felt like Star Wars, it's generally considered the weakest of the three films.  What's the biggest difference between RoTJ and the two preceding movies?  GL got rid of Irvin Kershner and directed himself.

So yes, I like what the EU offers and I think it was much better for having someone approve what went into it so that the lore made sense and we didn't have levels of contradiction between different source material.  But therein lies the problem and makes me disagree with this here:

&gt;Now Disney comes in a with the nerf-hammer and nukes everything, adding more insult to the injury by trashing GL's original material for the sequel trilogy.

The problem is that the lore was so well developed and integrated across source materials that it would be incredibly difficult for Abrams to pick and choose what will and won't remain canon.  The X-wing series was masterful, sure.  But there were quite a few weaker installments like *I, Jedi* and *The Crystal Star*.  How do you decide what stays and what goes when there's such a strong interdependency between all the different installments?  There are a few exceptions- the Han Solo Trilogy was pretty independent of other series and occupies a time niche that the new core movies aren't going to be set in- but *exceptions* these are.  For all intents and purposes inclusion is best done in an all-or-nothing form.

The other problem is that the sheer extent of the lore made the EU extremely crowded.  Did you notice that in recent years many of the books being released were centered around the children of the core series' principal characters?  It wasn't because they're the most interesting characters to write about.  Look at the full timeline of established material in the EU and you'll notice that most of Luke's, Leia's, Han's, Lando's (etc) non-geriatric years had been pretty much spoken for.  JJ Abrams is an outstanding storyteller and any worthy contribution he'd make to the canon would be epic.  Inserting a new story with our favorite characters from the original trilogy would make huge problems of continuity.  Even if we decided that TFA would be part of the extant EU and changed details to make it fit, it would introduce a significant question of why material set later in time didn't seem to make any mention or reference to any of the events of the story.

Look, I'm on your side here.  Watching TFA at a midnight premiere is going to be one of the most unforgettable things ever to happen in my life.  But I was also filled with an immense sadness- I felt all the books and graphic novels of my childhood disappearing as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  But it's just one of those cases that you need to accept some situations will leave someone unhappy even if it's the best choice to make.  You don't give an incredible storyteller like JJ Abrams control of one of the most incredible franchises of all time and saddle him with needing to incorporate endless other canonical factoids and tidbits, many of which were the creations of significantly less talented men and women.

worldbuilding,"Here's some little bits of information.

* The continent will most likely be 2/3 the size of Europe. 

* IT IS IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. The southernmost passage through sea is frozen over in winter, but not for too long.

* The central water passage (named the Tourniquet) isn't a river. Since this planet is slightly smaller than Earth, you can't see land on the horizon if you're standing on the other side of it. Large naval ships have no problem passing through the waters. It was kind of inspired by the opening of the St. Lawrence with a slightly than mediterranean climate. 

* It will be similar to Europe in 1600-1750 where most armies consists of cavalry, mortar, and rifleman regiments.

* The Northern sovereignties are desert like cultures, but nothing at all similar to the middle east. Instead, it's something different for once. I'm trying to do a Mexican/Spanish/Brazilian Ranchero theme up there. The deserts are similar to the sonora.

They also have a culture wherein there is a legal marriageable age of 13 for females, and a legal system in place so that parents can take the issue to court whether or not their child can be married off at even younger ages. Saudi Arabia, probably the most stable Middle Eastern country, has no marriageable age, and as I have said, they also have rampant slavery, that the government turns a blind eye to. It's as if they only make it illegal so they don't look bad, but do some research and you find that nobody gets locked up for it.

As for Syria, that wasn't America's fault. The Arab Spring (a wonderful point of recent history, look it up) caused many country's populations to rise up and oust their dictatorships in favour of democracies, and the Assad regime was simply one of those that refused to back down. 

I'm not trying to exempt our western culture from issue, hell the fucking British government got in trouble for destroying evidence that may have linked them to a paedofile ring. America's ""democratically"" elected government is almost entire controlled by lobbying/private corporations. Sure there are many issues in our world.

But data doesn't lie, and it's so much worse in Islamic countries. 

Have you ever just taken the time to look at a map of Muslim majority countries, and tried to think of something good for each of them? Because I have, and I struggled.

Dictatorship or democracy doesn't matter in the big picture, although obviously democracy is better, and I support the side of democracy. The point is the culture is terrible from what I can see.

I'm sorry to use anecdotal evidence, but I see people on social media screaming ""don't bomb the poor Syrians!"", when half of them would literally be either stoned or whipped for who they are, whether it's gay people or women who don't cover up enough for Muslim culture, they would be breaking the law.

Korea could try picking a specific country to bring in more immigrants/potential permanent settlers from who are more likely to get along well with the native population, or bringing in smaller groups of different ethnic groups to balance things out.

Uh, not for *most* allergies. For most people, seasonal allergies can be controlled with over-the-counter medicine, like Zyrtec (cetirizine).

Other allergies, like most food allergies, don't need constant medication to treat. The cost there is in the emergency drugs, which (hopefully) don't have to be used in most cases because you'd avoid whatever food it is that makes you react.

As the Allies make their final push in the European Theatre, a battle-hardened Army sergeant named Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) commands a Sherman tank and his five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Outnumbered, and out-gunned, Wardaddy and his men face overwhelming odds in their heroic attempts to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany.

&gt; Fury received positive reviews from critics, who praised the portrayal of war, as well as Ayer's direction, Price's score and the work of its main cast members; with the performances of Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, and Shia LaBeouf singled out for praise. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a ""Certified Fresh"" rating of 77%, based on 221 reviews, with an average rating of 6\.9\/10\.

You're right that when you get to super high elo, i.e. mid/high challenger they drop off, but I think this is mostly due to the fact people will know when you're playing and always ban you out if you're on the other team, as well as the fact that otps can't go pro, so they mostly all have things to do outside of the game and can't practice constantly. 

Faker literally is the counter example to what you're saying, when he was undefeated on LB he would pick it unconditionally in pro games, leading to SKT's loss vs EDG because EDG picked a full comp to counter LB. Werlyb was basically a Jax otp is the EU LCS, he could play other things but Jax was banned every game against him even when they could counterpick and this is when Jax wasn't even considered good.

Guess how much of a delay i got on NA ? (tips, it's over 200 / 250 at best)
Ranger is a class way too weak and if you want to be very good you'll need a good reactivity and a low ping, because once you're against a player with decent ping, even if he's not well geared or bad, if he can attack two time while you attack only once, you'll die probably.

Templar at least is able to survive a bit with his strong buff, but once again, you'll still face the ping issue.

On EU, i average 35 constantly, with some very rare lag spike in the evening because of the amount of people playing.

The ""Iranian nuclear threat"" was just BS like ""WMDs in Iraq"", intended to justify a policy of imposing regime-change there

*Many countries* can make nukes if they wanted to, and quickly too http://old.seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002041473_nukes21.html

The reason they don't, is because nukes are actually overrated
http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/ten-reasons-iran-doesnt-want-the-bomb-7802

In the case of Iran, note that Iran was *already attacked by WMDs* when the US was backing Saddam's chemical weapons attackes against Iran 
http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/26/exclusive-cia-files-prove-america-helped-saddam-as-he-gassed-iran/

http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/17/opinion/17iht-edjoost_ed3_.html

The Iranians, however, *refused* to resort to use of chemical weapons,*even legally and in self-defense* because they objected to WMDs on *moral grounds* http://cns.miis.edu/archive/cns/programs/dc/briefs/030701.htm

Instead the Iranians accepted 100,000 casualties from chemical weapons alone.

**So when the Iranians say they oppose WMDs, theyve *proven* it with blood**, while Iran's biggest critics have proven the opposite. 

Furthermore, note that Iran *for years* offered to place additional restrictions on its nuclear program well beyond what the NPT requires or what other nations accepted, but these offers were ignored by the US in favor of their regime-change agenda. There are numerous examples of the US killing off any chance of a peacful negotiated deal since that would have meant no regime-change

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/17/AR2006061700727.html

http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/05/opinion/05iht-edzarif.html?_r=0


The US pressured the EU not to accept perfrectly reasonable Iranian compromise offers
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/10007603/Iran-how-the-West-missed-a-chance-to-make-peace-with-Tehran.html

The US also killed a deal negotiated on behalf of the US by Brazil and Turkey, *after Iran had said yes,* thus pissing off the Brazilians and Turks so much they publicized the letter that Obama had written to them endorsing the same terms of the deal just a week earlier 

http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_brazil-reveals-obama-letter-in-spat-over-iran-nuclear-deal_211443.html

 In fact, Iran made *better* offers in the past than the recently negotiated deal, but was ignored 

&gt;In 2005, Iran offered a deal.  We rejected it, refused to talk to Iran directly, and doubled down on sanctions.  Ten years later, we settled for much less than what was originally offered.

Permaculture,"I read a few lines and rolled my eyes so far into the back of my head that they nearly got stuck.

I'm an amateur historian. I love researching history. One constant throughout history has been conquest and colonial attitudes. The only thing that changed in the Renaissance was that the Europeans saw a leap forward in tech over everyone else, giving them an advantage that allowed them to do what others could not and leading to more pronounced ideas of racial superiority.

Nearly every ancient conquering people from all over the world, not just Europeans, practiced something akin to colonialism. The Romans, the Egyptians, the Arabs, the Mongols, the Khazars, the Chinese; all did it at some point, and they all had distinct ideas of racial superiority.

This is the typical ""noble savage"" delusion. These people are just trying to survive and expand power bases. The Aboriginals of the Americas were every bit as warlike and exploitive as the Europeans. The whole reason the Americas were so easy to colonize is because many of the first successful settlements were built on the ashes of town and farmlands that had emptied due to mass die offs from European diseases. Over 90% of the deaths due to European colonization were from disease that spread ahead of the colonizers. This is why colonies in Asia and Africa never achieved European majorities.

Nudelete,"&gt;&gt; ""This past year has been hard for me. Coming from a family who has a long history of giving, I’ve put myself in an embarrassing situation. The top google search results for my name links to “Banned Canadian CS:GO professional Joshua ‘steel’ Nissan”. People don’t seem to grasp how poorly this reflects on me. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Since I can remember, I’ve always been trying to do things on my own. I felt weird asking for help, even from my family. I needed to do things on my own and show that I am capable. I deal with everything on my own. Especially my depression. I’ve carried this baggage for over a decade. I remember when I was first told I was “depressed” when I was 16. I thought that’s what “normal” felt like. But I’ve since felt happiness. There were periods of time that I was happy. I chased this happiness across the world, quite literally. It took me to Europe and back. Competing in CS brought me happiness. Travelling and meeting everyone involved brought me happiness. Now that’s gone again.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I’m fortunate enough to have a handle on my own situation, but not everyone is as lucky as me. I don’t like talking about my personal life and I’ve done my best for years to keep private parts about my life private. All that is changing tonight because I’m in the position to do more.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Last night I had mentioned I was donating my FPL earnings for the month to charity. It blew up in a reddit post but still there were people who came in to shit all over everything. It seems like no matter my intentions, some people will never let go or change their perspective of me and that’s completely fine. But they’re wrong and that’s all that matters.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I’ve ordered my new chequebook which will see a lot of use this year. To start it off, I’m pledging $10 000 to the family foundation which I’m a part of. As a director, I am going to have the funds split between the following Canadian charities:  Canadian Mental Health Association, Defeat Depression, and Pathways to Education. Additionally, every dollar I earn from competing in CS:GO after expenses in 2016 will be sent to the foundation. I don’t know what that will amount to, but it will include any and all local events I am allowed to participate at, as well as other things I am eligible to participate in such as FPL.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Through the years I’ve gotten by with CS as my crutch. I never dreamed it would become my job, I never thought I could make a living out of it. I played it because it made me happy. What happens when your distraction becomes the reason that you’re distracted? What happens when CS becomes the reason you need therapy?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I still to this day need to drink to get through some of my streams. But I’m to have learned about myself early on. Going to University was never something that I wanted. I only went so I had an excuse to study psychology to understand myself better. Not everyone has the same opportunities that I had.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Streaming has been good to me. This year I have the opportunity to help others. Be safe. Happy New Year.""

Also, my lawyer dealt with tons of green card holders, and have never had any deportation cases.  There's no reason to deport any greencard holders who aren't doing anything illegal. There's a reason why US wants greencard holders in the country and are inviting people to move here; EU doesn't do that. I'm a good resident, paying a lot of taxes, created jobs for other people, and live a normal life by the rules like any American, thus I'm absolutely not worried about deportation. 

&gt; The United States never forces citizenship on anyone, either you want it or you do not.

Got it. Thanks for this!

&gt; You do not have to give up any citizenship to be American, keep all of the others, who cares.

news,"Well, the *American* idea of ""pro-gun"" is *vastly different* than the European idea of ""pro gun""... Keep that in mind on reddit. We literally have two different continents represented here. Depending on what time something gets posted, it will be discussed by either Europeans or Americans (for the most part). 

Example:
*American pro-gun*: Any rifle or pistol is purchasable at the age of 18 with no government paperwork and no special tax or licensing required. Magazines carry how ever many rounds you are willing to pay for and ammo is unregulated.

*European pro-gun*: Certain rifles and maybe pistols are purchasable at 18-21-25ish so long as multiple background checks are done, paperwork submitted a couple weeks in advance and safety classes taken with permits and government registration issued. Ammo is heavily regulated and requires government notification upon purchase. Magazines only allowed to carry small amounts of ammo and any rifle that looks scary, eerr I mean ""assaulty"" is banned. 

The American version of anti-gun is basically Europe's pro-gun group. Europe's anti-gun group are considered far far left liberals in the U.S. Another good rule of thumb is that the U.S. ""Leftists"" are considered ""center right"" in Europe, while European ""center left"" are considered ""commie bastards"" in America.

svenskpolitik,"&gt; Så du anser alltså att höga murar som motar bort flyktingar är humant? Inser du inte själv hur vansinnigt det låter. 

Det låter bara vansinnigt för någon som är mer intresserad av att göra saker som verkar snälla än saker som är bevisat effektiva. 

Höga murar runt Medelhavet är humant av samma anledning som höga murar runt minfält. Det är mer inhumant att lura desperata människor att det är värt att ta sig över minfältet än att hindra dem från att tro att det överhuvudtaget är möjligt.

&gt; Anledningen till att du argumenterar så som du gör är att antingen förstår du inte mäniskors drivkraft att flyr från krig och efterföljande förtryck eller så vill du inte till varje pris att Sverige vare sig ska ta emot vare sig flyktingar eller invandrare vilket väldigt sorgligt för annars skulle du inte argumentera så som du gör.

Nej, anledningen är att det har testats förut och bevisligen fungerar. Vill man rädda människoliv på Medelhavet så finns en beprövad metod; därför bör vi använda den. Vi har redan testat att hjälpa folk över, men det dör folk i båtarna ändå.

&gt; www.manskligarattigheter.se/sv/de-manskliga-rattigheterna/vilka-rattigheter-finns-det/flyktingars-rattigheter I länken har du de konventioner som reglerar asylrätten och det är ganska uppenbart att eu bryter mot det och det är uppenbart att länder kan vara med i FN och ändå bryta mot konventioner som de har skrivit på.

Jag har läst FN's flyktingkonventioner. EU bryter inte mot dem. Vi skulle kunna neka asyl till alla utom FN's kvotflyktingar utan att bryta mot dem, precis som vi gjorde 1989.

&gt; Att avskaffa transportöravtalet så att flyktingar kan ta sig till Europa på ett säkert sätt är en av de bästa sätten att motverka skruppellösa smugglare på medelhavet.

Bara om man gör det i kombination med att stänga Medelhavet för flyktingar. Och att avskaffa transportörsansvaret har sina egna problem; den flyktingkris vi sett i 2015 skapades av vår generösa mottagning, men den krisen är ingenting i jämförelse med krisen som skulle uppstå om vi avskaffade transportörsansvaret utan att strama åt mottagningen.

&gt; Du skriver att alla inte kommer att ha råd att ta flyget det må så vara att alla inte kommer men idag är det ju ännu färre som har råd med den vanskliga och farliga vägen över berg och hav med hjälp av smugglare för att ta sig till de länder där de vill söka asyl.

Javisst, vad är väl livet på några fattiga, bara vi kan rädda de som har råd att flyga och kan känna oss moraliskt överlägsna samtidigt, eller hur?

&gt; Du förespråkar en politik som stänger inne folk i sina länder som de vill fly ifrån pga krig

Nej, inte de som flyr från krig. Men de flesta flyktingarna som kommer till Europa gör inte det. Inte ens Syrierna som kommer hit flyr från krig; de flyr från fattiga förhållanden i Turkiet. Detta ger dem inte asylskäl i Europa enligt FN's konventioner - de har redan flytt från kriget till Turkiet.

&gt; Du förespråkar en politik som stänger inne folk i sina länder som de vill fly ifrån pga krig med efterföljande förtryck du skrev att Afghanistan var exempel på ett lugnt område. Det beror på vari Afghanistan du bor och framför allt vilken folkgrupp du tillhör. Jag antar att du vet att Daesh tvångsrekryterar folk i Afghanistan för att ta ett exempel på situationen.

Visst, och ligor kidnappar kvinnor i Ryssland att säljas som sexslavar. Vi ger inte asyl till ryssar för det. Lösningen på Afghanistans problem i nuläget kan inte vara att de tappar en hel ungdomsgeneration. De behöver sina unga män för att bygga upp landet igen och det kan de inte göra om de flyttar hit.

&gt; Du oroar dig för braindraining i krigsområden eller oroliga områden. Det är ju bättre att folk får fly än att stanna kvar i kriget elker förtrycket.

Kriget, visst, men som sagt så är det rätt få av flyktingarna i Europa som flyr direkt från Syrien.

Men när det gäller Afghanistan, till exempel; för vem är det bättre att deras ungdomar flyr? Inte oss, naturligtvis, som får bära en stor kostnad. Inte de som bor kvar i Afghanistan, som nu blir ett svagare land med ännu sämre framtidsutsikter än förut. Kanske för individerna som flyr, men de får det knappast särskilt fantastiskt här heller eftersom vår integration fungerar så väldigt dåligt. Sanningen är att de luras hit med historier om guld och gröna skogar, men som vi kan se i tidningarna så är det många som blir besvikna på verkligheten när de kommer hit.

Din politik lurar dessa unga människor över halva världen för den moraliska överlägsenhetens skull.

StarWars,"#----------SOILERS BELOW FOR BOTH THE OLD EU AND TFA------------

* Instead of becoming a general, Leia becomes head of state of the New Republic and a career politician and diplomat. EDIT: I should also mention that Leia gets some Jedi training in EU. She learns to use a lightsaber and builds her own (interestingly she chooses the color red as her lightsaber color) and occasionally fights using the Force, but never takes it seriously enough to become a full-blown Jedi.

* Instead of staying a smuggler, Han becomes a legendary general of the New Republic and a war hero. Also, the Millennium Falcon eventually gets tricked out and updated with modern technology and repainted black.

* Luke does eventually restart the Jedi Academy and Jedi become populous again, similar to the prequel era. The Force and Jedi aren't shrouded in myth like in TFA; instead they're common knowledge amongst everyone. Luke, Leia, and Han also become galaxy-wide famous and are well-known instead of being the subject of legends and myth like they are in TFA.

* Han and Leia have twins named Jacen and Jana, followed by a younger brother named Anakin. All three become Jedi. However, Anakin gets killed in the Yuuzhan Vong War (see below) when he's a teenager, which I think (I had stopped reading the books by then) eventually leads Jacen to turn to the dark side and betray the Jedi similar to Kylo Ren.

* Around the time of TFA, the Yuuzhan Vong, an extra-galactic hostile species that's immune to the Force, invade the galaxy and kill billions of people and basically destroy Coruscant. In the process Chewbacca and Anakin Solo both die. (The book series was called the New Jedi Order and basically rebooted the entire Expanded Universe away from the New Republic vs. Empire dichotomy).

* Also, Luke hooks up with a fellow Jedi named Mara Jade who was originally a brainwashed assassin sent by the Emperor to kill him. (Luke's new Jedi Order doesn't have the same rules regarding celibacy mostly because these books were written before the prequel trilogy established that idea.) They eventually have a son around the New Jedi Order era named Ben. I believe Jacen Solo eventually takes on Ben as his Sith apprentice when Ben is a teenager.

* The Empire lasts for a *very* long time after the end of ROTJ, and most of the books before the New Jedi Order detail a decades-long struggle between them and the New Republic (mostly due to a lack of imagination on the part of the authors I think) in which the Empire almost defeats the New Republic several times (First Grand Admiral Thrawn conquers half the galaxy, then a few years later Emperor Palpatine gets reborn as a clone and almost turns Luke to the dark side). At the time of the New Jedi Order, there's a small part of the Empire still left over that only spans a few systems called the Remnant that the New Republic has made peace with (they might be comparable in influence/size to the First Order, but they aren't nearly as evil/fanatical anymore and are mostly made up with aging officers/bureaucrats that cling to the old Imperial ways because they're out of touch). The New Republic eventually teams up with the Remnant to fight the Yuuzhan Vong.

TheRedPill,"&gt; It's comical that there was an era where women looked at a man and evaluated him based upon his fortune and productivity. Now it's back to caveman where women want dick.

Not at all.  Status manifests itself in many ways.  

An unemployed drummer could not have been considered high status many centuries ago.  He can be today, because we've largely eliminated the natural constraints of our survival (at least for the time being).  A ""dysgenic"" sphere of status-seeking (punk subculture, hippies, etc.) can survive, because we mandate that everyone in our society survives. 

Cavemen times weren't a hypergamy fest, they were the opposite.  Everyone depended far more on each other, and hunter groups are considered to be the most egalitarian forms of human societies to have ever existed.  When men are more necessary, their availability of sex increases.  Hypergamy was at its lowest 30,000 years ago.  

When grains and milk came to Europe 4000 years ago was when hypergamy was unlocked.  Societies that came up with social mores to artificially restrict womens' hypergamy were the ones that were more successful in the neolithic, and they conquered others and spread their gyno-restrictive culture, in a sort of feedback loop of success.  

The era where ""women looked at a man and evaluated him based upon his fortune and productivity"" have been long gone, for anywhere from 4000 - 10,000 years, depending on what part of the world you look at.

EPCOT has different pavilions from around the world. Small snapshots of that country were you can sample the food, drink and culture. The English pavilion isn't exactly what it's like and not everyone eats fish and chips but for most Americans who will never see Europe it's a great representation.
My husband and I spent the day just eating and drinking 'around the world'  a day which also had no disney aspect to it. 
Disney World to me has so many memories both from my wedding/honeymoon and from being there as a child, it was one of the only places my family didn't fight every day.
I have disney related things in my house like towels in the bathroom with the Mickey ears on them. I don't particularly like Mickey mouse but looking at the memorabilia around my house reminds me of those holidays.
When I watch disney movies at home it also brings me back there. 
A few people at my work do think I'm crazy and probably just a big child. But anyone I know who has been there including adults with no children, will always have a smile on there face thinking about it and recalling their memories. 
It's a place so amazing that you could wait over an hour for each ride, surrounded by people, crowded every where, but when you leave you forget all that and just think of the good points.
I could go on and on, when people ask why I love disney so much and don't understand, I'll ask them have they ever been to Disney world. 95% of those who don't understand me haven't been.

You can't do that without an economy, and you can't develop an economy selling to people without money.

This is an extraordinarily basic concept in economics, chap. I think you would benefit an enormous amount from looking into the history of societal development in Europe, particularly from an economic standpoint.

Because I can assure you this much; there is no ""Ohhh, well why didn't we think of that"" solution to African economics which doesn't necessitate massive changes on the part of the global economic powerplayers.

&gt;It is corruption from the government.

I genuinely mean no disrespect, but don't think you quite understand how corruption on such a scale is actually combated, either.

To make a very long explanation a very short one; it's virtually guaranteed to require a violent uprising and the total removal of the government in power, which means more conflict, more instability, more problems, and doesn't even leave you with a guarantee that the new government won't become as bad as the old.

Futurology,"&gt;most of the cutting edge learning and innovation was being done in the Middle East, by Muslims. And then there's China, India, etc.

Everyone knows about this. Zero relevance to today—or the last few hundred years. 

&gt;But this was more because of racism and discrimination than any innate superiority on the part of white males.

I'm familiar with this hypothesis. It's also irrelevant; the fact remains that these white men you're browbeating into saving the poor, starving masses are the ones actually advancing technology. Well, mostly. There's plenty of Asian, Middle Eastern and SE Asians doing that research too. 

If you want a group of people to use their wealth and genius to save the world, asking nicely is instead of insulting them is a good start. Another good choice would probably be not demand that they lie down and die for the sake of people that have contributed far less to the world. 

&gt;[...] we're seeing more non-white and female scientists and engineers and innovators

""Non-whites"" are disproportionately represented in scientific research—they're just the wrong kind, to people like you. As to women; the more choice they have in society, the less likely they are too choose STEM fields. Which is why women in ""oppressive"" Asian countries are more likely to be engineers than in gender-progressive ones in Western and Northern Europe. 

&gt;It's not actual biologists and what-not who are throwing money at these ventures; it's just tech enthusiasts and businessmen. 

Also know as the people with money to fund things. Scientists as a whole don't tend to accumulate a lot of wealth. They might be providing the funds but the teams they hire are top-notch.

Entrepreneur,"Sure. Not in chronological order:

1. An online subscription based student essay database website back in '96. Sold several years ago and still running. Never made much. Lesson learned: students are poor, better choose a product or service with a more affluent target audience.

2. Online service to decrypt locked, password-lost MS documents by brute force. I outsourced the processing power required to a company in Australia. Failed. Reason: there wasn't enough demand for the service and the IT overhead was too high. Data protection became an issue too.

3. 1 page double sided A3 what's on guide for tourists in a large city. 5,000 copies delivered to 100 hotels etc. every week. 32 advertising spots sold for 100 Euros/week. I ran it for 2 years with my gf, writing the content, selling the ads and doing the distribution ourselves (10 hours every weekend dragging a heavy trolly around on foot!). Was successful and cleared 2-3k / month but the commitment of self publishing and distributing a weekly publication took it's toll and wasn't sustainable. Sold for 15k. The business wasn't scalable or able to be run passively one day - it didn't generate enough to hire staff. Both of these attributes are very important.

4. A chain of franchised printer cartridge recycling shops in a major city. On paper (well, Excel) the business was a wet dream. Ink costs nothing and you can sell a refilled cartridge for 50-70% of the price of a new one. Margins in the 2000% range. What we failed to appreciate was a) the difficulty in sourcing good quality empties. Demand outstripped supply. b) the original manufacturer's response to this growing industry - make their cartridges damn near impossible to refill. c) the influx of cheap Chinese clones to the European market. d) considerable competition from other franchise chains as well as independents. I saw the light after a couple of years and sold my stake. My partner went the other way and bought the master rights for the whole country, managed to sell 20 or so franchises but eventually the whole thing failed. Lesson: timing is important. Had we set the business up a decade earlier it would have been very successful. Also, I learned that knowing when to give up the fight is just as important as perseverance. Don't let your heart rule your head.

5. Window cleaning. Buy a ladder, a squeegee and a bucket and hey presto, you're in business! Until you get threatened with violence by existing window cleaners whose territory you've invaded... Aside from the fact that all I did was create a job for myself with little chance to build into a solid business, I failed to appreciate the willingness of the competition to physically remove me from the equation. I was only 19 when I did this though, which makes it a little less embarrassing!

6. Import business. 20 years ago savvy manufacturers started to get their act together and created websites showcasing their products. I researched products that I thought might have a market in the country where I was living at the time. The cost and complexity of the importing process, insufficient funding and the extreme difficulty in even getting my products reviewed by the major retailers ended that one after a year or so.

7. Freelance IT support. I did this for several years and was reasonably successful, making about 3k / month. Essentially it was just a job though, and I jumped when the cartridge refilling opportunity came along.

There have been a few others, but they didn't really progress much from the initial idea and research phase. Hope this has been of help :)",cyi7qyz,0,,False,t1_cyhl4dc,t3_3yu3lh,1454214618,,1451646179,,False,0,t5_2qldo,bobpetersenthethird,2,2

Probably there would have been more radioactive pollution, but the original release of radioactive material was already huge.

If the second explosion would release 10 times as much (and assuming death toll is proportional to it) you wouldn't even get neat the millions of deaths...

lego,"Hello fellow Australian (but the UK is my home now).

It's not just with LEGO. It's with everything in Australia as you no doubt know. And I don't think it's companies being sneaky. I think it's a logistical fact with distribution and keeping industries alive. If you want toy shops, book shops, music shops etc. to stay open, they need to charge a higher price. For example, the reason books cost so much in Australia is because without that price the Australian publishing industry wouldn't exist.

And I think LEGO is the same. Without the RRP being what it is, there would be no business incentive for LEGO to sell to Australia. You have a country nearly twice the size of the European Union but with less than 5% of its population. And it's on the other side of the world! So when you factor in all the overheads that come with shipping, distributing, stocking, selling, and promoting toys and models in a country as vast as Australia, it makes sense. It sucks balls but it makes sense.

"" If two people were married and had sex, no matter what their age, no crime was committed because a woman was her husband’s property.""

We don't look at these societies and say ""hey look, a 7 years old girl had sex with a 70 years old man and it's nothing wrong with that because she was her property."" We don't consider them to be the perfect example of morality.


&gt;Some societies were racist because they had the Bible as their moral code on how to treat non-whites.

&gt;He was not 60, he was 52.

&gt;All I am saying is try and judge the marriage with that time when they were alive, not 21st century lens.

So we are not allowed to judge racism from a 21st century perspective? I find it a really disgusting thing to say in a conversation with a black man or woman ""hey look from the 1st till the 19th century societies were deeply racist and it's nothing wrong with that because we can't judge them using our modern morality""

It took the Nazis to invade Denmark for us to get independent. We became partially independent in 1918, which was also a time when Denmark was at war alongside Europe.. And basically whoever wanted could come and fish in our waters. A resource that was vital to Icelandic life.

And even though Icelanders weren't forced into sex slavery in WW 2, there were lots and lots of bastards with American father's here. We were also a neutral nation and were still invaded by the British in 1940.

And this is the modern time. Denying someone a family because society says being unable to have a child on your own for reasons completely out of your control, is just wrong. It might have made sense 30 years after the Japanese occupation to deny a Japanese halfblood a job, but now it shouldn't. I know cultural heritage is a huge thing in Asia, but denying someone a job because he was adopted and doesn't have the right blood is fucking stupid.

52in52,"**Name**: Waiting for Godot

**Author**: Samuel Beckett

**Avg Rating**: 3.80 by 79717 users

**Description**: A seminal work of twentieth century drama, *Waiting for Godot* was
*Samuel Beckett's* first professionally produced play. It opened in
Paris in 1953 at the tiny Left Bank Theatre de Babylone, and has since
become a cornerstone of twentieth-century theater. The story line
revolves around two seemingly homeless men waiting for someone or
something named Godot. Vladimir and Estragon wait near a tree on a
barren stretch of road, inhabiting a drama spun from their own
consciousness. The result is a comical wordplay of poetry, dreamscapes,
and nonsense, which has been interpreted as a somber summation of
mankind's inexhaustible search for meaning. Beckett's language pioneered
an expressionistic minimalism that captured the existentialism of
post-World War II Europe. His play remains one of the most magical and
beautiful allegories of our time.

news,"The better solution would be to pump money in the refugee camps of the region, educate the refugees there and helping them prosper in these places, it is not the sole responsibility of Lebanon Jordan or Turkey to help them but of the whole world.

The moment when these people were in the refugee camps, and this may sound a bit radical but it is true, they were safe. They didn't need to come to Europe but they still came. Their reasons are clear, understandable, but there is no reason to encourage it. We can bring a bit of Europe to hem in stead of the other way around. And lets not forget Turkey pushed them to come to Europe.

The money on the long term being spent is certainly astronomical. We are not talking about just shelter we are talking about education, jobs, social welfare for 100.000s of people. These people need years of education and training, we are not talking even about other forms of integration, which also cost money ofc. The amount probably won't bankrupt Europe but it will be still very hard to explain in the coming years.

Ofc we need to help refugees, there is not a single doubt about that, but the best place for them is not here. It simply won't help them, and it won't help us, while we can make a difference if they stay in the region how hard this may sound.

And the USA is not responsible for destabilizing the region, their action at most fastened the whole process, but the Middle East was way before the Iraqi Wars or any American intervention a region going in the direction of these kind of events.

malefashionadvice,"About two centuries of machismo patriarchy is to blame. Men actually used to dress in a more shapely way and more similar to women until the 1800's.

What does each sex bring to a relationship under patriarchy? Men bring a paycheck, women just have their bodies in the form of reproductive capacity. Women can express their physical potency by showing of their bodies. This ends in an arms race it makeup and clothing for women. Men... are there with their paycheck. To the extent that make fashion has developed, it has largely developed to express the size of the paycheck behind that nice suit- not to express the potency of the body so much. Of course there are exceptions to this, but that's the general outline: blame it on patriarchy, which arose under industrial capitalism.

As women came into the workplace women's clothing changed and so did men's. That was the 1970's- which is often mocked but precisely because it opened up new space for men to experiment and to express their body like never before. As women's paychecks keep moving closer to men's (it's still ~70-80% of men's) the necessity and practicality for the average woman to spend so much time and money on clothing and makeup decreases. Conversely, with the sexes moving closer to income parity men are freer to express themselves and find a mate using fashion and by expressing their bodies. I think this is directly responsible for the massive growth of weightlifting among men. As always, development is uneven, rural areas haven't changed as quickly, etc etc.

By comparison, men and women in Europe dressed similarly in the pre-capitalist and medieval ages.

For a modern contrast we can look to Eastern Germany, the GDR. Men and women were more equal than in perhaps any other modern, industrialized society. In combination with a strong feminist movement, women in the GDR experimented with less feminine and more practical dress, and men experimented in the opposite direction. The facetiously titled German documentary ""Do Communists Have Better Sex"" explores this history.

europe,"&gt; Well, it does sound silly when you pick an example out of a bunch of conflict to make your point, right?

You picked those countries, not I. It's not my fault they don't strenghten your argument.

&gt; Furthermore, Australia does receive refugees/migrants without prior notice, however they have the intelligence to send them away which is exactly the point of my initial statement.

Australia. Which is a landmass separate from everywhere, on the southern part of the southern hemisphere where the only place people could come from are those couple islands to their north is not exactly the same as Europe, who borders Asia, the Middle East and Africa - the poorest and most unstable regions currently in existence. 

&gt; I can point to Afghanistan, Congo, Rwanda, Somalia and tons more. They're farther away than ""just miles"" (poor Turkey) and yet, (Western) Europe is, as always, paying the price for their and America's fuck ups.

Ah-ah. Distance is relative. Europe is far far closer and more accessible via smuggling routes for these people than anything else. Do you expect them to swim to Japan or USA when they can literally walk through unguarded borders in Africa and hop on a 30 minute boat ride to get to Europe? You're missing the broader perspective.

&gt; A magical wand that is border control, huh? Spain manages to do it rather well, they would do an even better job with support from the entire union which it lacks. The Greek-Turkish border isn't, nor should it be the standard.

Border control is fine, if you have places to send these people to. And, well, surprise surprise, Syria is not an exactly functioning state at the moment. I imagine should Morocco fall to civil war, the fabled 'Spanish System' would be equally as defective as anything.

travel,"I live near Frankfurt and have been to every town on your list, so I made a lil itinerary I think you might like better! 

.

* Amsterdam --&gt; Berlin (~ 6 hours)

When you're in Amsterdam, make sure to check out the nearby [Keukenhof Gardens!](http://www.viator.com/tours/Amsterdam/Keukenhof-Gardens-and-Tulip-Fields-Tour-from-Amsterdam/d525-2550LIN12A) It's so beautiful. I'd recommend taking a viator tour or something because it [looks](http://imgur.com/c0YyteG) like it's a pain in the ass to get to on your own, but it's definitely worth it.

Berlin is my second favorite place in Germany. So many things to do, see, and explore. The city is huge, so I'd recommend getting a [Berlin Welcome Card](http://www.visitberlin.de/en/welcomecard) so you can use the trams without having to worry about getting tickets every time. You also get a lot of discounts with it. I got the 48 hour one for around 20 euro and it was well worth the money in my opinion. (Amsterdam also has a similar card that I used called the [I amsterdam city card](https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/i-am/i-amsterdam-city-card).)

.

* Berlin --&gt; Cologne (~ 4 hours)

Cologne is a gorgeous city. I did the city in one day, and that was enough time for me to see everything I wanted to see. Though, (if you're interested) I'd recommend doing the chocolate museum before 5PM, because they close at 6, and don't like letting people in after 5:30. I learned that the hard way. The mustard museum there is pretty cute too. It's small, but they sure know how to make great German mustard. Also, there is a really neat Mongolian BBQ-like place called [Mongo's](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187371-d718219-Reviews-Mongo_s_Restaurant-Cologne_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html) that was tasty. You should definitely reserve a table if you go, because it was really crowded when I went on a Thursday night.

.

* Cologne --&gt; Heidelberg (~ 2 hours)

Heidelberg is a wonderful town. You could also stop at any of the little towns along the Rhine as well. This area is amazingly picturesque and romantic. I'd highly recommend taking a [Rhine River boat tour](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g198429-d3344638-Reviews-Rhine_River_Day_Cruises-Bingen_am_Rhein_Rhineland_Palatinate.html) so you can have a glass of local wine while watching all the gorgeous castles go by. 

Heidelberg is lovely. I'd suggest doing the castle first, then taking the [bergbahn](http://www.bergbahn-heidelberg.de/en/Stations/Station-Castle/Station-Castle.html) (""mountain train"") into the city and exploring the city after. This city can also be done in an afternoon. Also, I had THE best schnitzel of my life at the [Schnitzelbank](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187286-d1343678-Reviews-Schnitzelbank-Heidelberg_Baden_Wurttemberg.html). It's a little hole in the wall but it was SO GOOD, and very authentic German food.

.

* Heidelberg --&gt; Triberg (~ 2 hours)

I highly recommend visiting Triberg in the black forest if you like fairytale towns and walking. Triberg is home to Germany's [highest waterfall](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187285-d190949-Reviews-Triberger_Waterfall-Triberg_Baden_Wurttemberg.html), and is also home to the worlds biggest cuckoo clock. Naturally, they sell a shit ton of cuckoo clocks there too. 

I would skip Rothenburg ob der Tauber unless you were going during Christmas time. Its a small town with like a thousand christmas stores, and it's a pain to get to by train.

.

* Triberg --&gt; Munich (~ 5 hours)

Munich (and Bavaria in general) has to be my all time favorite area ever. I have never been to the actual city and explored all of Munich, but I've been to the Oktoberfest a few times, and annually visit a town called Garmisch-Partenkirchen that's about an hour away. There are some great [tours](http://www.viator.com/Munich-attractions/Neuschwanstein-Castle-tours-tickets/d487-a90?pref=02) from Munich to Neuschwanstein too! 


* Munich --&gt; Nuremberg (~ 1 hour)

I haven't been to Nuremberg in a long time, but I'm sure you will both love it. I think the home of the lebkuchen would be a great place to end your trip in Germany!

.

* Nuremberg --&gt; Prague (~ 4 hours by bus) 

I'd suggest taking a [bus](http://www.european-traveler.com/germany/bus-train-nuremberg-prague/) to Prague, because for some reason it takes about 10 hours by train. 

Prague is gorgeous, and make sure to check out the castle too! Also make sure to try a [Trdelnik!](http://www.food.com/recipe/trdelnik-slovak-czech-sweet-pastry-165166) They're pretty tasty.

.

Some tips: A lot of places close around 5/6PM, and some even take lunch breaks around 12 - 2., and in turn a lot of restaurants don't open until 5PM, and are only open for lunch for a few hours. Almost everything is closed on Sundays, so utilize that day for lengthy train travel or relaxing.

Good question - and ""why should we care?"" would be one more) Expected by women, society and the common narrative.

Blahblahblah, date jerks and assholes, all of them, just don't marry, when you're older (and about to hit the wall) you will understand that you want a good guy - then you marry.

movies,"Then he could have a Creed-like spinoff where he can train the son of his tragically deceased chocolate lab rival, Apollo Breed. Here's what I'm thinking:

1. **Air Bud** - original Air Bud, absolutely nothing needs to be changed here

2. **Air Bud: Golden Receiver** - only good sequel of Air Bud before they jumped the shark with World Pup. I have my issues with it, but it at least introduces us to the idea that Air Bud plays more than one sport. 

3. **Air Bud (2018 reboot)** - A sports dog trains for the Olympics breaking down prejudices and speciesist stereotypes along the way. In this five-act film, he manages to not only participate in the Olympics, but open the door for other species as well. A rival dog, Apollo Breed manages to become the first dog to win a gold medal at the Olympics. Tragically, Air Bud succumbs to alcoholism and a slew of other demons. His owner dies. He runs away. He gets captured by pet control and looks to be put down, but somebody adopts him before then. Just when things start to look up for Air Bud, it turns out this owner runs dog fights in his backyard and has chosen Air Bud because he was aware of his athletic prowess. He makes a killing off of these dog fights and Air Bud manages to survives because of his solid background in mixed martial arts. There he befriends a wise old pitbull who makes Air Bud realize he wants to train and win the gold medal. Together, they plan their escape. An opportunity doesn't arise for 12 dog years. One day, after the old pitbull is placed into a fight that he can't win and dies, Air Bud snaps and kills the owner. In the utter chaos of this act, Air Bud has to make his way through 88 other rabid dogs to escape to freedom. Air Bud in his enraged state massacres each and every one of the other 88 (who are very clearly fighting against him with lethal force). He takes all of the owner's money from the dog fights, escapes to freedom, and proceeds to hire the best Olympic trainer to train him for that year's Summer Olympics. He ends up finally getting the coveted Gold medal, but is immediately implicated in the deaths of 88 dogs and his owner. The investigation shows a mountain of evidence showing that Air Bud did indeed kill these individuals, though understandably in the heat of the moment. The judge sentences him to 25 dog years in prison and his gold medal is revoked. As we see Air Bud enter prison with a line of fellow prisoners, the shot zooms out to show a great crowd of people picketing and holding up signs like ""Free Air Bud"", ""Air Bud #1"", ""We Love You Air Bud"", and ""Return the Medal"".

3. **Air Bud: Old Dog New Tricks** - Following his stint in prison, Air Bud rejoins the Olympics to try and win another medal; one that won't be revoked because of his manslaughter charges. He's old, but trains for it. He seeks out the help of Apollo Breed. Apollo Breed, seemingly retired, ends up being inspired by Air Bud to rejoin the Olympic Games for wrestling. This decision ends up proving fatal for him as he dies from a menacing Russian human played by Dolph Lungren. Air Bud seeks to avenge this loss in the final round in which he does. He dedicates his Olympic Gold medal win to Breed and the last shot is of an older Air Bud running with the Olympic torch in his mouth. 

4. **Breed** - Filmed over the course of 12 dog years, we see Apollo's son Adonis grow into, not just a fully fledged dog, but also a promising basketball star. We see Adonis get cut from his freshman high school basketball team, come into a pair of Air Bud sneakers, use the magical powers from these shoes to become a basketball sensation, and get drafted to the NBA. After his team (Seattle Supersonics) make it to the NBA Finals, Adonis' sneakers are destroyed in a motor vehicle accident. Adonis seeks out the real Air Bud for more pairs of his sneakers. Air Bud, instead of giving him sneakers, decides it would be better to actually train the kid on the fundamentals. After realizing that Adonis is nowhere near the NBA-level of talent, much less the star point guard of a team contending for a title, he eventually gives him a pair of sneakers. However, following reports that a similar situation has taken place in another area of the country, the NBA a institutes a rule banning all sneakers that were formerly worn by talented players such as Air Bud, Magic Johnson, Wilt Chamberlain, or Brian Scalabrine. Adonis then buckles down and trains even harder to get to an NBA level of talent. In the NBA Finals, the Sonics go down 0-3 to the Minnesota Timberwolves. In the win or go home game, Adonis Breed records a triple-double (if you count turnovers) and sinks a dramatic 3-pointer in quadruple-overtime to win the game. It turns out that the magic of the Air Bud sneakers were in Adonis all along! However, they unceremoniously lose the next game at home 134-65, because the Seattle Supersonics game plan relies too much on isolation plays with Adonis Breed rather than strong defense, ball movement, and controlling the tempo on offense like the Wolves. The ending sees an interview with Wolves captain Kevin Garnett yell into the mic ""ANYTHING IS POSSIBULLLLLLLLL!"", while Adonis Breed walks to the locker room with the only victory being that they didn't get swept by the team that delivered such a humiliating defeat.

Mind you, that the Air Bud expanded universe novels will no longer be considered canon after the 2018 reboot. However, elements of the EU like Jacen Bud, Santa Paws, and Kevin Garnett have clearly made it into the new movies.",cyiem6d,0,,1451684510,t1_cyib0m3,t3_3yzphj,1454217925,,1451669778,,False,0,t5_2qh3s,darkrabbit713,14,14

AoS is in large part lifted from non-Christian religious myths(and don't try to claim otherwise, because they said as much in the WD wank-session with the AoS writers when it launched), with a heavy dose of D&amp;D/Planescape, if anything it's *less* original than WHF because Fantasy had been stewing in itself with dozens of different excellent writers over thirty years and so had time to use the borrowed and stolen building blocks to build something new. It's certainly less coherent and relatable than WHF because there's no anchor to it, no sense of permanence or meaning, it's just a load of disjointed battlefields being fought over because there needs to be a reason to play the game, and the novels are shallower than even the most dreary of bolterporn.

That is the future of Firefall for current US/EU players. The game was stripped down and is being rebuilt. That means staff from Red5 being removed too. A ton of money was put into Red5 over the years and essentially the game failed. Now The9 is trying to salvage something.

http://www.deseretnews.com/article/853851/Putin-wants-NATO-to-let-Russia-join.html?pg=all

[Here's a good summary, excerpts:](http://www.rferl.org/content/Could_NATO_Membership_For_Russia_Break_Impasse_In_European_Security_Debate/1949690.html)

&gt; NATO membership for Russia is an idea that gets floated periodically, but never seems to gain traction. In 1999, then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed Moscow's desire to join the alliance. The idea has also been raised by former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, in addition to Mandelbaum and Krickus, and was floated by Michael McFaul, who currently serves as senior director for Russian affairs at the U.S. National Security Council, in a 2006 article titled ""Why A Democratic Russia Should Join NATO.""

&gt; On the Russian side, a report published this week by the Contemporary Development Institute, a Moscow think tank set up by Medvedev, declared flatly that NATO membership should be a goal for Russia in the 21st century. Another Russian report [English text here], issued by the Valdai Discussion Club in December, described possible Russian ascension to NATO as ""quite attractive,"" but says it was much more possible in 1991-94. The report concludes that at present, the notion is far less likely, ""but cannot be ruled out entirely.""

&gt; Konstantin Kosachyov, chairman of the International Relations Committee of the upper house of Russia's parliament, says that a serious NATO-membership proposal could be embraced by Moscow.

&gt; ""I would welcome such a turn of events, but only if it is not a game intended to weaken Russia or distract it in fulfilling some road map,"" says Kosachyov. ""If behind this idea there really stands the possibility of Russia joining NATO, then that would be a correct way of looking at things from NATO's point of view, and it would be an interesting challenge to Russia, one that would have to be accepted.""

I also read a source (somewhere, can't remember where) that said Putin asked Clinton directly. I can probably dig it up if you'd like.",cyigzwi,0,,False,t1_cyieo5u,t3_3yzs1a,1454219118,,1451674139,,False,0,t5_30hhs,LimitlessLTD,-5,-5

casualiama,"Hello friend!  I’ve been lurking r/solotravel for a couple weeks and got really excited when I saw your comments blow up.  I am a male 21 years old and am starting a 2 year grad school program at University of Florida next week.  I have 2 summers before I have to join the real world and I wanted to spend one interning and the other traveling the world.  I have been having difficulty trying to decide on locations to visit for a trip to Europe lasting anywhere from 3 to 8 weeks.  I saved $5,000 for my travel fund, but wouldn’t be upset if I didn’t spend all of it.  I would love to experience hiking through the beautiful landscapes that I see in movies.  I would enjoy big cities, cultures, and museums also.  I am fit and interested in doing some more extreme stuff like climbing a mountain or something, although I’ve never done anything like that before.  I got my undergrad in physics and would love to get to CERN in Geneva at some point.  Traveling slowly and not on a strict schedule would be awesome, but I’d also like to visit many different places. I have been to Italy once already so I’ve been trying to avoid Rome and Venice.  I would fly out of Orlando or Tampa.  Do you have any suggestions on a route that would encompass all of my interests?


On another note, is solo travel lonely?  My parents think it hinders the experience by not sharing the cool stuff with people, but I think that is an excuse because they don’t want me traveling by myself (safety and such). I am fairly independent and am not uncomfortable by myself, but my parents seem to think a long trip is boring when you don’t share it with somebody.


I really appreciate any advice because the whole task is really daunting.  I’m worried if I don’t get some direction then the summer is just going to come and go, and I don’t want to waste this opportunity.  Thank you!

BasicIncome,"&gt; If banks holding Portuguese debt tried to collect on them today, we would have a 'Portuguese crisis' happening. Don't you think?

Well it will happen to Portugal if they get to Greek levels of debt, because compared to other debtor nations, Greece has incredibly high debt levels which forces lenders to ask for higher interest, and that means that for Greece to sustain it's borrowing it needs much greater devaluation than the rest of Europe.  Portugal isn't at that level yet, but if they continue to carry higher debt loads they will eventually get to that point and will either experience a crisis similar to Greece, or they'll convince the ECB to devalue more quickly.  Currency devaluation isn't really a great solution though, because it can get out of control very quickly as the countries with lower debt loads are now better off taking out more debt to gain the advantages that the high borrowers get which increases downward pressure on the currency and threatens hyperinflation if they end up devaluing faster than their competing currencies in the world.  At the end of the day, these countries need to have restrictions on their deficits or function like the US where subsidies are sent to member states on a federal level as opposed to letting the states borrow until they run out of lenders.  There's just moral hazards that exist here where the member nations are better off being irresponsible in the short term and it destroys the long term viability of the model.

Just because it hasn't happened to Portugal yet doesn't mean it won't happen eventually if they make the same choices that the Greeks made.  It's really inevitable, because the only way to sustain above average debt loads in a common currency is to pay higher interest, but being a heavy debt holder means that you actually can't even afford lower interest rates, so eventually your borrowing dries up as investors look to slightly less bad credit risks (which are all that exists in today's world because all nations are debtor nations in some capacity).

These problems aren't new, crises like the one in Greece used to happen all the time when the world was using gold as the common currency, and the Euro is just re-raising the same issues that existed back then.",cyihdyo,0,,False,t1_cyigf0u,t3_3z0du1,1454219302,,1451674832,,False,0,t5_2v1jk,emitnulB,3,3
investing,"I am not clear on how your points are relevant to a recession occurring this year.

The first link talks about the correlation between stock market return and PE ratios. The stock market could correct 10-20% without a recession, and has done so frequently.

Your second link talks about yield curve inversion which occurs when the fed decides to cool off the inflating economy to avoid hyperinflation by raising short term rates. That sometimes throws the economy into a tail spin.

Right now there is very little inflation in USA &amp; Europe. So any recession would likely be deflationary, rather than the inflationary/yield curve inversion variety we are familiar with. 

What I mean by a deflationary recession (because most recessions end up with deflation), is the cause of the recession might be a deflationary shock. What we are used to is at the first sign of too much inflation, the Fed boosts short term rates, inverting the yield curve, the economy recesses, inflation turns into deflation, then the fed drops short term rates to boost the economy again. 

If, instead of what we are used to, lets say China recesses or if yields spike/ stocks drop or if lending slows then folks might have less money to spend. Will the fed be effective if we have a sudden wealth destroying shock while rates are at zero? I certainly wouldn't expect much from the US or European politicians.

So until inflation picks up and rates pick up, I think the chance of a recession is low, but if it happens I suspect no one will see it coming and the impact will be high. ",cyihfev,0,,False,t1_cyidfv9,t3_3yzdz9,1454219321,,1451674903,,False,0,t5_2qhhq,ihatechange,1,1

The US (9,857,306 km2) is not physically larger than the EU (10,180,000 km2). It is actually the other way around. Also the EU is more spread out into different countries and also languages. If ESL manages to do it there they should also be able to do it here in the US.

I'm going to need a source for that. After all you can't expect me to believe that while both dates imply that there was still water present, and the document explicitedly states that the corium touched water, all must be wrong because you say so.

&gt;What you're reading about there is the floor below the flooded basement chamber. The same sort of steam explosion could have occurred if it melted even further, into the soil and water table. This is the infamous China Syndrome.

It talks about both things. However, had the corium penetrated into the Bubbler pool, then the refractory concrete injected into them would not have been unnessecairy.

Thus, it did not meaningfully intrude into the pool.

syriancivilwar,"European had huge birth rates in the 16th century because society was improving and there was an abundance of food and other basic needs. Because of this more people could get a profession that was not farmer which led to massive improvements in technology. The big technology advantage was what got Europe to conquer Africa, America and South Asia not the fact that they had many inhabitants.

Holland was the top nation in the 16th-17th century and if you look into the country you will see it only had a few million inhabitants but they still enslaved lots of people. Same for Spain they conquered most of South America where they were heavily outnumbered VS all the tribes. The fact they killed or enslaved most of these tribes is because they had guns and horses while the Inca's only had Spears and bows. (the Spanish also brought over diseases which helped them but for this example that is not relevant) 

So even if the millennial plan you speak of succeeds it won't let them conquer the world. They will not catch up in technology.

Wherever NATO wants to bomb, the people need to think that the country is a backwater third world shithole, and it's easy to just accept a false image of a place like that when it's fed to you if you don't really care about the topic in the first place. 

And bitter citizens here are not helping that image because they like to rant about their country on places like reddit and devote half of their argument to the genre of music they hate so much whilst thinking that they are unique and rare snowflakes because they listen to Hendrix jam sessions or whatever.

I believe Norway has quite a strict ""you must learn Norwegian if you're want to remain in this country"" rule for new immigrants. If you want to gain a permanent residence permit then it is an absolute requirement that you learn Norwegian to a satisfactory level.

With that being the case, the country is very much one where (although nearly all Norwegians speak excellent English) nearly all business and official documentation will be in Norwegian.

We had a discussion on the Breydel with most of the mod team and decided that you were basically right. The post should be allowed.

 It was originally removed for being low quality, because it was so vague. The post would certainly benefit if you made it a bit more precise. In its current form it could be seen as basically ""/r/Europe: post me anything from anywhere"" which is why it was removed (for being too vague/low quality). 

Anyway, seeing it's been so long since we removed the post, we'll allow you to post again at a time of your choosing. If you send us a link via modmail if/when you do so, we'll make sure it passes straight through :)

ukpolitics,"&gt;comparing share of GDP is a real joke because everywhere other than the West (- Japan) shrunk massively in comparison.

That's the whole point though. The Raj was under the British empire's jurisdiction at the time, yet no serious effort was made to modernise it's industrial capacity because doing so would require an enormous amount of capital investment and would undercut the niche of the factory work that was plentiful in England at the time. India's given role was to provide cheap and plentiful raw materials at bargain bin prices, not to industrialize. It wasn't profitable for them to improve the situation in India rather than exploit it, so they let it languish. 

In many ways, the burden on the Indian public was increased under the British; the salt taxes originally put in place by the East India Company were widely condemned for how severe they were. For example, land rent was doubled at procured saltworks in Calcutta in the mid 1700s by the company and a transit tax was put in place. The profit produced from these exploitative new laws didn't remain in India, it went to the East India company, an international organization whose wealth was tied to financial institutions in Britain, not India. This is just one example of how laws put in place by the British rulers of the time were used to sap wealth from India; through extreme forms of taxation and regulation of the movement of goods, which was another incentive for the rail network, which could turn a windfall on the transit of taxed goods like salt and later cotton. This produced wealth was then handled by nebulous international companies, that moved it around the world, where it would typically eventually settle in investments in the developing industrial nations of western Europe, in the form of estates, private ventures and so on.

It's important to note with your example with China as another power that lost it's position as an economic powerhouse due to a failure to modernise, the rate of wealth loss is [drastically different](https://infogr.am/Share-of-world-GDP-throughout-history), with India's portion of wealth falling at a dramatic rate between 1700 and 1820 compared with China, a period that correlates with the incursions of the British East India company from the mid 1700s when their private army conquered Bengal, an event that triggered the gradual capitulation of India to the British crown. China then only falls behind Europe in the 1870s, a good decade or so after the Raj was established and a great deal of the infrastructure needed to transport mass quantities of goods like cotton exports for the British textile industry was completed. This would suggest that the incorporation of India into Britain's colonial economy hastened their loss of wealth and exacerbated poverty in the region as the revenues generated from harsh taxes and tarriffs were moved out of the country, much in the same way supranational corporations continue to do so today. This is the basis of the argument that enormous wealth was drawn from colonial India while the country's infrastructure was neglected to allow such exploitation to continue.",cyim9rq,0,,False,t1_cyiiu8g,t3_3yygs0,1454221604,,1451683448,,False,0,t5_2qhcv,MrJMaxted0291,2,2

52in52,"**Name**: The Tempest

**Author**: William Shakespeare

**Avg Rating**: 3.79 by 104177 users

**Description**: In *The Tempest*, long considered one of Shakespeare's most lyrical
plays, Prospero—a magician on an enchanted island—punishes his enemies,
brings happiness to his daughter, and comes to terms with human use of
supernatural power. *The Tempest* embodies both seemingly timeless
romance and the historically specific moment in which Europe begins to
explore and conquer the New World. Its complexity of thought, its range
of characters—from the spirit Ariel and the monster Caliban to the
beautiful Miranda and her prince Ferdinand -its poetic beauty, and its
exploration of difficult questions that still haunt us today make this
play wonderfully compelling. *The Tempest* is a play by William
Shakespeare, believed to have been written in 1610–11. It is set on a
remote island, where Prospero, the exiled Duke of Milan, plots to
restore his daughter Miranda to her rightful place, using illusion and
skilful manipulation. The eponymous tempest brings to the island
Prospero's usurping brother Antonio and the complicit Alonso, King of
Naples. There, his machinations bring about the revelation of Antonio's
low nature, the redemption of Alonso, and the marriage of Miranda to
Alonso's son, Ferdinand.

Sino,"Sino-US Relations: 78% Chinese Believe West Intends to Contain China

By Gu Di and Liu Xin

Global Research, December 31, 2015

&gt; A new poll shows that some 78 percent of Chinese believe Western countries intend to contain China.

&gt; Some 36.5 percent said the West intends to and have already moved to contain China. Some 41.7 percent say Western countries have such intentions but there exists no obvious action, according to a survey released by the Global Times’ Poll Center Tuesday.

&gt; http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Chinese-poll.jpeg

&gt; The annual survey, “How Chinese people view the world,” involved telephone responses from 1,530 people from seven Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Changsha.

&gt; Jin Canrong, deputy dean of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Tuesday that this is how the Chinese feel, following the past year’s events.

&gt; Relations between China and the US have been strained in 2015 due to issues like the South China Sea disputes and cyber security. China and Japan locked horns in disputes around the Diaoyu Islands and Japan’s attitude to face up to its wartime history.

&gt; “The US and Japan did things aimed at China, but China is not that easy to contain,” he said.

&gt; The poll also finds that some 69.4 percent consider Sino-US relations China’s most important bilateral relations. However, the number has dropped from 81.3 percent in 2009, 74.6 percent in 2012 and 72.3 percent in 2014.

&gt; Bilateral relations with Russia, Japan, and the EU ranked as China’s second, third and fourth most important diplomatic relations.

&gt; “It is no surprise to see Chinese pay more attention to Sino-US relations since it influences their lives as the two countries share common interests,” Jin said.

&gt; The survey showed that 27.8 percent agree that the South China Sea disputes have been affecting relations, while 10.5 percent think the cyber security issue soured Sino-US relations.

&gt; Other issues that may strain the Sino-US relations are the Taiwan issue, 22.6 percent, and the Diaoyu Islands, 22.1 percent.

&gt; According to the survey, 56.9 percent, most of whom are young people, are optimistic about the future of Sino-US relations while 28.5 percent believe relations will be strained.

&gt; Jin said that the positive views on the development of Sino-US relations reflect the respondents’ confidence in China.

&gt; “The conflict between China and the US is more about national interests than ideology,” Zhang Jiehai, a sociologist at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.

&gt; Ambivalent relations

&gt; Meantime, 28.6 percent said bilateral relations with Russia are China’s second most important, and 24.9 percent said relations with Japan are the third most important.

&gt; “Sino-Russian and Sino-Japanese relations are considered the most significant neighborly relations. China and Russia have been in recent years moving in a good direction, while Japan and China are still locked in feuds, including historical issues and disputes over the Diaoyu Islands,” Zhou Yongsheng, a professor at China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.

&gt; Zhou said that although Japan is China’s second largest trade partner, the disputes between the two countries involve national honor and interests, leaving most Chinese with little faith in the future of Sino-Japanese relations.

&gt; People who think relations between China and Southeast Asian countries remain important to China dropped by 2.5 percent, compared to 2014. And 53.6 percent agree that disputes in the South China Sea were the main cause of strained relations.

&gt; The survey also showed that 53.9 percent are optimistic about the future of China’s international relations, while 37.6 percent are concerned.

90% for commercial launcher is reasonable if we assume a big price advantage and fast turnaround. Some satellite providers might chose to launch with a competitor for strategic reasons, but I guess my claim is that if it's not really price sensitive than it's not really a commercial launch. E.g. some government or the EU might chose to use their own launchers despite SpaceX offering a much lower price.

The 50-60% for US comes from the assumption that there is going to be at least two launchers for availability reasons, but the cheaper one gets slightly more business.

- I went to undergrad at Berkeley and came home to a white dude taking a dump in the landscaping of the front of our apartment building. Of course when I told him he couldn't do that there he kept going and got pissed at me for watching. I called the management company right in front of him, it was before cameras in cell phones. 
- I saw a white guy with the shortest shorts in Venice near some Latino teens making out, he was so close I decided to say something. He was sooooo mad I interrupted him hahaha. I'm gay and not used to looking at dicks and his penis was hugeantic btw just to add grosser details. It stopped me in my tracks like wtf you bringing out that bs Python near children!! I didn't say that tho I just said knock it off or I'll call the cops. 
-I was riding my bike in the early am in Santa Monica on a Sunday morning, a number of hot moms were having an outside yoga class, there was the thirstiest creepy line of homeless guys sitting at benches just staring at them. It's so awful women, esp moms are treated like that how uncomfortable they can't even strech outside without pervs openly jacking off well just one. I saw it he was just rubbing it but it was clearly in his pants stil and I said ""NO"" really loud as I went by, but everyone just looked at me like I was crazy, you know kill the messanger if you are trying to disrupt those patriarchal perv entitlements.
-The lady at the Starbucks was black and fairly nice looking, it must have been her kink, but she had her legs spread so that when I opened the door her cooch was out to the world, or the people waiting in line to go. She was on the filthy floor though so if that is some underground kink club for people at least instruct each other to put something down to protect you from pee germs.
- I lived in Europe and have traveled quite a bit so I've seen all kinds of pervy things that aren't as odd or awkward, but only in the US have I seen publish shitting.
-I had a boss when I lived on a Greek Island get interrupted shooting up by one of the customers while he was in the bathroom, it was slow so I guess he thought it was chill enough in the place. Hahahah
This is fun, I'll think of more, but for now that's a few. The bearded white guy hitting a crack pipe on NYE in the middle of the day in a Silverlake parking lot between cars, that one was just a new one for me tho Hahahaha. Wtf?

worldbuilding,"I mean people make technological progress when there's an incentive to do so, in a world without incentives for progress there wouldn't be as much progress (if any).

This is hard to do for things like trains/plumbing/medicine which help with fundamental needs like food, shelter and health. I find it easier to imagine not having an incentive to invent the technology of war (armor, guns, siege engines, fortresses, ships, etc).

Not having an incentive to invent toilets is hard to imagine.

I'm not totally sure what incentives pushed technology forward really. I know that, for example, 14th century England had significantly less plumbing infrastructure than ancient Rome. So, clearly incentives varied over time and location. Maybe the filth primarily caused disease in the peasant population and England had so many peasants that they just weren't valuable at all? I really don't know.

Alternatively there could be disincentives. Perhaps some long standing political organization has assimilated ideas from natural philosophy and view new ideas as a threat to their power and influence.

I think in European History much scholarly progress was made by members of the clergy, perhaps if you don't have an equivalent class of people then scholarly progress would be slowed (this mostly effects fields like astronomy, math, economics, etc. I believe blacksmiths are the guys who invent better swords and armor and whatnot).

Of course, growth is the preferred means of doing so, but advanced economies do not tend to grow much faster than 3% per annum.

badeconomics,"I did not say that slavery necessarily equals capitalism, only that it was fairly relevant to capitalism's founding - see [here](http://chronicle.com/article/SlaveryCapitalism/150787/), for example:

&gt;We cannot know if the cotton industry was the only possible way into the modern industrial world, but we do know that it was the path to global capitalism. We do not know if Europe and North America could have grown rich without slavery, but we do know that industrial capitalism and the Great Divergence in fact emerged from the violent caldron of slavery, colonialism, and the expropriation of land. In the first 300 years of the expansion of capitalism, particularly the moment after 1780 when it entered into its decisive industrial phase, it was not the small farmers of the rough New England countryside who established the United States’ economic position. It was the backbreaking labor of unremunerated American slaves in places like South Carolina, Mississippi, and Alabama.

&gt;When we marshal big arguments about the West’s superior economic performance, and build these arguments upon an account of the West’s allegedly superior institutions like private-property rights, lean government, and the rule of law, we need to remember that the world Westerners forged was equally characterized by exactly the opposite: vast confiscation of land and labor, huge state intervention in the form of colonialism, and the rule of violence and coercion. And we also need to qualify the fairy tale we like to tell about capitalism and free labor. Global capitalism is characterized by a whole variety of labor regimes, one of which, a crucial one, was slavery.

Skyforge,"there is a lot of mmo's that are free to play that mostly sell cosmetics or minor quality of life improvements that dont offer any change at all to gameplay but speed up time to do stuff.

here is the thing about any mmo the cost of developing the game for a single person vs developing a game for millions of people is not that much different in cost just a little extra in server and bandwidth costs the vast majority of the price comes in the actual development of the game. what you want to make the most money is not to squeeeze every single possible penny you can out of every player but to have a much larger playerbase where everyone chips in a little bit.

the major problem here is the credit CAP even without the credit cap you couldnt really compete with p2w players but at least you could farm a ton and mitigate it a little. and its not just a little p2w its a lot. take this event for example the victor medals from this event would take a f2p player over 3 years to get doing the daily missions every single 8 hours every day of every week of every month of every year without ever failing one(half reward) 3 years man and thing is there is no real way to circumvent that. you cant just spend an extra 10 hours a week farming to farm 10% more resources. because there is a set cap that you can never bypass.


I think they would do a lot better profits wise (at least in the eu/na scene i dont know about russia) if instead of having all these costumes free from getting farming or maxing classes or other stuff instead to sell them and all the game stat improving shit is strictly from playing the game the only advantage a playe rcan get is to be efficient and well planned rather than opening wallet. this type of strategy only chases out potential clients.


the thing is they are being too greedy. they are not just trying to ask you to pay a normal sub fee to be competetive they are saying hey pay 10-20times what a AAA subscription mmo costs every month and still fall behind other players. now who the fk wants to put up with that?

thing is people are fucking vain as fuck and gladly and consistently pay out the dam ass just to look cool. you can do this from awesome mounts like the one in this event really cool rare costumes that people go HOLY SHIT THATS COOl. or even something this game doesn't have that would be awesome as fk is alternate skill effects that only change how your spells look nothing related to dmg.",cyiq6oj,0,,False,t1_cyias4q,t3_3yugmu,1454223519,,1451690619,,False,0,t5_2ymb9,mayainverse,3,3

vintageaudio,"I like working on it and it gives an opportunity to get a lot of well built power at very reasonable prices if one is careful with their selections and knowledgeable enough to bring said selections back into spec. If you venture into vintage without some repair skills, expect to either settle for mediocre performance and reliability, swap gear until you get some that works properly or pay someone to restore a unit for you. This hobby can be cheap if you're willing and knowledgeable enough to get a little dirty. If you want turnkey performance, be prepared to shell out quite a bit of cash. 

Speakers... For every wonderful classic Klipsch, JBL, Polk or ADS, there are a thousand rubbish vintage speakers that aren't worth picking up from the curb. The exceptions however can be quite lovely, as many of us will attest to. Some classics, like old Altecs can fetch thousands. The CD era produced some very good speakers designed to show off the strengths of the format, many of which are old enough to be considered vintage but still use modern materials and construction methods. These can be absolutely fantastic but don't pay too much for them because for not much more than the ""top dollar"" prices, you can get a new speaker in kit form that will decidedly outperform them. I love my ADS-L500s but I have a design I built 10 years ago that is definitely superior and the cost to build them was only ~$250. Look for bargains or buy new basically. 

Vintage sources, other than tuners and turntables, are hell to get working perfectly with little reward. Yes, I'm talking about tape machines, both cassette and RTR. Belts are the least of your troubles here. Worn and virtually irreplaceable mechanical parts like rollers and heads may await those willing to adventure into tape and you'll go through all this work knowing that your laptop can make a higher quality recording. It's purely a nostalgia or legacy media preservation purchase, IMHO. I'm going to rebuild my Technics RS-M228X but only because it looks cool and because sometimes people want to convert their cassettes to digital formats and I need something to get the tape into the computer with.

80s CD players are another nostalgia only item. The 90s-new units have better DACs, lower noise analog circuitry and more reliable optical assemblies. Plus, it's unlikely you'll find one in silver to match your 70s to early 80s stuff anyway. (Heck, you'll have an easier time finding a *new* CD player in silver!)

Turntables... There are few modern turntables worthy of your consideration. Most of the good ones are vastly overpriced units for customers with more money than sense. Technics made the SL-1200 until 2011 and Onkyo is currently producing a direct drive unit called the CP-1050; these are some of the few modern tables worthy of your consideration. In most cases, you'll get higher performance and or more value for your money by getting a good direct drive from the 70s-80s. Maintenance is generally simple on these thanks to very high quality mechanical parts that wear very slowly. Pick a good cartridge and stylus and lube per the manufacturer's instructions and you'll be treated to very solid performance for decades with little maintenance required. (Older DD units may be getting to the point of needing capacitor replacement.) 

Tuners... Assuming you don't need digital reception (HD Radio in the US, DAB and DRM in EU), a vintage tuner is a fantastic idea. Currently there are two types of modern tuners for sale: Those that are kinda pricey and provide OK but not stellar performance and those that are awesome and super expensive. A good vintage tuner, assuming it's in alignment, is a fantastic way to enjoy radio. Alignment issues are a deal breaker unless you have a shop that can perform them and you're willing to pay the alignment fee. (usually around $75-100 as the shop has to recoup the cost of the expensive alignment gear somehow!) AM performance in particular has been neglected on many modern designs so if you have good AM programming that you'd like to hear more clearly, a good antenna along with an older tuner in good working order may be exactly what you need. While it won't deliver the clarity and detail of FM, AM doesn't have to sound awful! 

Surround sound processors, A/V control amps and A/V receivers... Modern only unless you have an old TV or don't need the video features at all. A modern surround sound processor will not only decode old analog formats but will also decode newer formats and will give you the modern connectivity you need to hook up modern sources. 

Amplifiers and Receivers... Excellent values exist here, especially if you can refurbish them yourself. Any quality brand vintage amp in good condition will make rated power with instantaneous reserves to spare. Gutless wonders weren't nearly as prevalent back in the days when the FTC actually enforced rules on power amplifier ratings. Watch the noise specs though, particularly if you enjoy digital recordings. Some of these old amps aren't the quietest designs. 

So that's my thought on the state of vintage vs. modern...so where does that put my system? Well I have three.

AskReddit,"&gt; Money does not make you happy.

This is one that I will always, for as long as I live, call out as bullshit. Sure, money wont magically change your mood just by you having it,but EVERYONE knows that and no one expects it to. 

Money doesnt MAKE you happy by having it, money allows you to DO THINGS which make you happy. If money isnt making you happy, then **YOU ARE NOT SPENDING IT RIGHT.**

The RIGHT way to use money to 'make you happy' is to buy *experiences.* Get a group of friends together and all go skydiving, take a cruise, travel the country with your loved ones and see all the landmarks, go backpacking through Europe or do the tourist thing and see all the big cities, open a business of your own doing something you WANT to do, or generally use your money to allow yourself do do what you love for a living. Get a nice (not super giant and fancy, but NICE) house and car, get some good quality clothes, eat good food, and have a few nice toys and gizmos, but dont spend your money on THINGS. Spending money on THINGS will not bring you happiness. Spending money on DOING things will.

Money wont make you happy? Well, in the sense that its not like some magical topical ointment that you just rub on your skin and it you just magically *become* happy, no. But in the sense that having money allows you to do fun things and have good experiences which will bring you happiness, yes, in that sense, money WILL make you happy if you have half a clue what youre doing.",cyir1lh,0,,1451692426,t1_cyic1o3,t3_3z0b46,1454223924,,1451692217,,False,0,t5_2qh1i,theinsanepotato,1,1

leagueoflegends,"**-	After you won back your LCS spot, did you or your teammates feel that there was something wrong with the organization and that the existing roster will be disbanded soon?**


-	To be honest, I didn’t feel it at all. I knew only that Cabochard was going to look for some new offers. But I thought that if the organization got better, he would stay with us. Especially if we managed to find a good ADC during the time given. So no, we didn’t feel it.


**-	So when you understood that you have to look for a new team, were you afraid?**


-	To be honest, yes, I was a bit afraid as I have been under the same organization for the previous 4 years. Well, to be precise not under the organization, but under those people who were a link between us and the organization, who looked after us and gave us all that we needed. And when you are looking for a new organization, everyone is new to you, you don’t know what to expect from them and what they are capable of. And I mean not the layers only, but also coaches and managers. I haven’t communicated with such people before, so it was pretty difficult for me to find a contact with them just from a scratch. Especially difficult to understand how the things work when you are searching for a new team, because I’ve never done it before.


**-	How was the process going? Did you address your friends or did people approach you on their own when they discovered you were looking for a team?**


-	Let’s say that at first I was approached by some organizations that were willing to get to EU LCS through Coke Zero Challenger Series. I began talking to them on that issue and through them I got to know some people who thought they would be in EU CS in 2016. I became close to some of them. During this the new opportunities and new information about vacant places in the teams appeared. In the result I got the contacts and the information and learned everything about EU, from CS to LCS: salaries, rosters, management, coaches.


**-	Now there is a trend to publish the salaries of the players. Recently Ember has stood up for clarity and availability of the information. Do you think that’s a right thing to do?**


-	I don’t know. I saw the numbers, but I didn’t consider the taxes, and as we know in some countries taxes can be up to 50% of the salary or even more. So if the salary is 40 000 and the taxes are 10% of that, it will be bigger than a 70 000 salary with 50% taxes. That’s why I have no interest in such articles until all the details will be revealed. And as for the information about average salary… I think that everyone who plays in LCS have enough contacts to learn how much money the other players get. You can always ask: “Hey dude, could you tell me what salaries they have?” And he obviously can tell you. Why not? On the other hand, this information could be useful for those who can’t get to LCS but play in Challenger Series, as things are really shady there. Probably this thing with the information about the salaries could work out there. I think that a lot of teams manage their revenue in an illegal way, even those who play in LCS. So at first you should check how legal their business is, and then make them reveal the information about the salaries, if it’s that necessary. I don’t think it is.


**-	And how many are there such organizations?**


-	I know a couple of them.


**-	Does Riot do anything about this?**


-	They try to better the environment as much as they can. They are trying to do everything properly, but teams and managers want to do everything to their profit. 


**-	What did Unicorns of Love require from you to show? And on the whole what do other teams require? For example, training for 10 hours every day or being top-1 in soloQ?**


-	There are no such requirements. It is obvious that I will be training 10 hours a day and try to be top-1. When speaking to managers, I just said that I train for a certain amount of time and that I achieved certain results in soloQ. But generally the training process should be with you team. If you want, let’s see how it works in training matches in future. We played scrims and everything was fine. We started to discuss other, more real problems that can prevent me from joining an European team. We spoke about the visa most of all.


**-	Did they care about what country are you from? I mean, the most important is the person himself, his experience and understanding of the game, right?**


-	Of course, it’s essential how you approach everything. Your attitude towards the others and how you accept the criticism.  Whether you are ready to improve your skills and your team. All these aspects are considered during your tryouts. And then they decide whether they want you or not. And as for me being Russian, it mattered only when discussing the visa issue. With our visa regime now we can be in Europe only 90 days in 6 months, and that’s not enough for even one LCS split, if you are not constantly going in and out. So we discussed the working visa, which is quite hard to get considering that I am a professional League of Legends player. But we are trying to get it, I handed in the documents and they took it. We’ll be working on it.


**-	You mentioned that you got offers from the other teams, not from NA only. Could you tell us what teams they were? Have you got any offer from Korea, for example?**


-	From Korea no. I’m more than sure that you can create a good team here in EU. Now your result is affected not only by your teammates but also by the organization that should care about all the players for them to improve and be able to complete at the top level on the international stage. And there is only one organization that was able to show the highest level of it. If you can manage everything as properly as SKT did, then you can achieve something. That’s why I didn’t consider going to Korea or China. I’ve got some offers from Wild Card regions to play for money. For example, Turkey or Brazil. But after thinking about it I decided that money isn’t the most important thing. I chose my team in EU LCS not because of money, but because of the team synergy that I feel in the guys. I’m fine with the money I get now.


**-	So you didn’t consider playing in CIS teams?**


-	It was never an option. I was absolutely sure that I wasn’t going to play in CIS. What the point for me to leave the higher league for the lowest one? What will I achieve there? There are no good teams, there is nothing.  There are some good players and you can assemble them and achieve something. But all that you’ll manage to achieve will be going to Worlds through the Wild Card Tournament. But you will be stomped there without any chance, as you won’t have a proper training. If you’re playing in Russia, European teams are unlikely to scrim with you.

flying,"Firstly, forgive the formatting, as I am on mobile!

The UK, as of last year, abides by the Standard European Rules of the Air (SERA) for pretty much everything (a few exceptions!). 
The minimum weather required depends on the class of airspace you are flying in, bearing in mind it's not always a good idea to go when you are a student, even if it's legal. Basically, what it boils down to for 'legal' weather to go flying is the forward visibility, the separation from cloud and maintaining sight of the surface. These all change depending on what altitude you are at just to confuse the matter!
As I haven't flown VFR in some time please take what I say with a pinch of salt, but a quick Google search shows the following page from the CAA with current SERA VFR minima. 
https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airspace/Rules-of-the-air/SERA-Implementation/

More information and detailed minima can be found in ENR 1.2 in the UK AIP, which you will have to learn for your PPL. An online version can be found on the NATS website under e-AIP: http://www.nats-uk.ead-it.com/public/index.php%3Foption=com_content&amp;amp;task=blogcategory&amp;amp;id=165&amp;amp;Itemid=3.html

Obviously when learning it goes without saying that one of the biggest pains is the wind! Expect many cancellations due to x-wind, or low level cloud with icing conditions! But please persevere! Flying in our crowded airspace is some of the most rewarding flying you can ever do IMO! Good luck!

WritingPrompts,"Tick, tock.

Earths space fleet was ready. Well, the most ready they ever could be.

Decades of research had been poured in these top-of-the-line fighter craft. Ground-breaking achievements were made on every front. A never before seen united human spirit was born, and every country participated the best they could, the most they could. 

In fact, countries were rarily named anymore. It was Earth. Not China, not the US, not Europe, but Earth.

Mankind had scrambled together 160 modern spaceships, 1405 satellite weapon systems, 2300 small spacecraft (basically guided scraps of metal with penetrating explosives) and a moon laser base. On the ground, hundreds of thousands of re-fitted space missiles pointed in every direction, connected to several computer networks to fire at one's command. Millions of camera drones were spread around for the inhabitants of Earth.

It obviously was not enough.

The last time they came, He had a fleet numbering in the tens of thousands. Earth managed to bring down two robot craft, and that was because of friendly fire on aliens behalf.

But the men would not go down without a fight.

He had the decency to come at the agreed place to fight, at the agreed time. A portal opened and thousands of black ships poured out. A large mothership lay in the middle of this monstrous battlegroup.

His voice boomed, and despite the vacuum of space, the space marine heard every word clearly. the alien leader captain Ea spoke to them. For the alien, this was purely for profit. Earth seemed to be valuable, he had said a hundred years ago, but he had not specified in what way. His army was entirely robotic. He controlled it and had defeated the defenseless Earth inhabitants. But he had the honour of a fair adversary. He had given mankind 100 years to 'impress' him.

It was on.

The last time, mankind could not land a single blow to them. This was different ...
 
Somewhat.

They traded unequally, losing five ships for one robot ship. But they could fight back. They were no longer the ants hundred years ago, but a small swarm of fiery raccoons fighting for their turf. 

The human fleet slowly shattered, and the robot fleet reached Earth and started to face the satellites and the secondary reserve fleet, which was a ragtag of unfinished ships and defunct weapon systems. 

Then, the command was given to launch the rockets. Future historians agreed their effective combat potential was negligible, but on that day, everyone could see space lit up with the soundless explosions, the growl of mankind. The battle raged on fiercely for hours.

It ended. Space debris floated everywhere, from both sides.

Ea's voice boomed again, this time in a different tone. ""Well ... That was impressive indeed. You have honoured me with a challenge, and I deem your race worthy. ""

""This galaxy is a dangerous one. A never before seen threat is spreading over the galaxy. In time, both of us will be affected by it. Perhaps in the future, we can be of assistance to one another. Until then, fare well.""

The robot fleet then retreated through a portal and disappeared. In its wake were floating hulls, technology ripe for the taking for mankind.

socialism,"Yes, Lenin and many others had concluded that they needed support from the European proletariat to succeed, but it was never going to come. The Bolsheviks were in a tough spot, and essentially engaged in wishful thinking for a time as a result. At that point, conditions were certainly more ambiguous, but (imo) it's difficult to maintain that a successful revolution in Germany was imminent. The German proletariat clearly was not ready/willing to smash the bourgeois state. Let's not forget that millions of members of the German proletarian class would come to support fascism within the next 10 years.

I think the important part is that the Comintern and Lenin (to a much lesser extent given his opposition to the tactics used during the March Action) didn't do the German Communist movement any favors by pushing for uprisings at that point in time. As u/TheRealKarlS pointed out, Lenin and much of the Russian leadership apparently sought unity, but the maneuvers of figures like Radek, Kun, and Zinoviev undermined this goal. Lenin was flexible and may have been able to steer the Comintern in a better direction, but he only had a few years left to live and Zinoviev would wield substantial influence over it as Chairman of the Executive Committee until 1926.

france,"Le système favorise beaucoup trop les éditeurs/investisseurs. Quand tu commences à t'inscrire à des systèmes de protections de droits d'auteur, t'as des contraintes débiles et tu te fais baiser. Le fait d'attendre 70 ans avant de mettre l’œuvre d'un défunt dans le domaine publique est complètement absurde, et Disney fait la loi à ce niveau là ce qui est inadmissible. La possibilité de pouvoir vendre ses droits, ou de pouvoir récupérer des droits sur quelque chose qui était clairement domaine publique (à la happy birthday) pose aussi quantité de problème. Aussi le fait qu'on ait pas (à ma connaissance) un équivalent du fair use en France est ridicule.
Je les ignorais pas, mais on parle du concept, pas de l'execution (qui je suis d'accord laisse à désirer).

Encore une fois une vision clairement pas informée premièrement de l'histoire des artistes, et deuxièmement du fait que le contexte économique a changé depuis les temps anciens. Premièrement, les deux couches sociales ont toujours existé. Il y a certes toujours eu des amuseurs publiques, ton exemple se référant probablement aux ménestrels (d'ailleurs dire à""à la base un artiste"" et utiliser l'exemple d'un type d'artiste qui n'existe que depuis le XIIe siècle c'est assez drôle...), mais il y a toujours eu en parallèle des gens qui travaillaient pour l'aristocratie. Et si tu veux prendre des exemple qui sont plus vieux d'un peu moins de 1700 ans, les grecs avaient déja un système autour de l'art extrêmement organisé. Donc l'argument est juste complètement invalide.
Quand bien même, imaginons que l'argument de tradition (qui est déjà en soi un mauvais argument) basé sur des faits tout simplement faux soit valide. Un film ça coûte des millions à faire, qui est-ce qui va te donner des millions pour faire un truc qui fera aucun profit ? Ou est-ce que les investisseurs auront le droit de faire du profit sur les ventes de tickets mais les artistes peuvent se brosser ? C'est quoi le système alternatif que tu proposes ? 

Quant au deuxième point. J'avouerais que je vois pas en quoi le type connu pour être mort de fatigue à 34 balais parce qu'il arrivait justement pas à combiner le train de vie que son status lui imposait avec une activité prodigue de compositeur t'aide à prouver quoi que ce soit. Et c'est pas Schubert qui était juste pas très connu. Mozart c'était une star, il avait une super carrière de compositeur, mais il faisait pas d'argent dessus parce qu'il n'y avait pas vraiment de lois de droits d'auteur à l'époque. Mais je suppose que c'est pour le mieux qu'il se soit fait enculer par le système, ça fait une plus jolie histoire à raconter.

geopolitics,"I didn't dispute that, this is why the question is do we delay the union until conditions are such that the EU cannot challenge our interests or do we compromise if that's not possible. My reasoning for why a union would be best (I am American) is offloading the cost of intervention. The USA is no longer a pole of attraction but working within a true coalition or group of powers which is good for avoiding the worst aspects of terrorism and radicalization in intervention zones but also in just the long term un-sustainability of our imperial project. It is much cheaper and better to have hegemony by creating again an institutional order nations are defined by instead of a force based dynamic that nations are constrained by. If we can facilitate an EU according to our interests as state planners wonder about, then it would avoid a war by founding the global order on common set of values. 

I have no idea how that in practice that would work but what it sounds like is that state planners would have to either long term plan constraints on European power and ideological development alongside concurrent nudging/manipulation on the domestic front to achieve this.

I should say I don't like the idea of any of this, I just remember this was the gist of the argument in The Choice and other books he wrote. The USA shouldn't, as he argues, rule the world but shape all the powers in its image so they further its interests by acting in their own. 

Now, as you point out, a unified EU probably wouldnt be subservient to USA as it is not.

news,"&gt;I'd point out that America is the only country where black-violence is so prolific; it's nowhere near as common in countries like the UK or Europe.

Blacks are about as overrepresented in crime in the UK than they are in the US; The problem is just less noticeable because there are proportionately far fewer blacks.

Blacks have higher violent crime offending rates in every dataset from every nation from every time period that has ever existed. There is nowhere where racial parity exists.

&gt;The solution is still the same (increase opportunities, attempt to desegregate neighborhoods, etc), unless you're proposing something more sinister.

Widespread acceptance of inherent behavioral differences by race would totally change U.S. policy. You would increase segregation, not decrease it, as blacks present a known higher risk to your person and property. You would diminish black employment opportunities, because hiring blacks whose actions you are liable for without some discounting factor applied would be insane.

More broadly speaking, yes, it would motivate more unpleasant policies. If it were known with certainty that black births present, say 2.0x the potential criminal risk of whites, rational tax policy would penalize black births relative to whites, the same way we tax cars with higher emissions or any other negative externality.",cyiugqv,0,,1451699152,t1_cyisnn3,t3_3z0zt3,1454225536,,1451698817,,False,0,t5_2qh3l,ISBUchild,2,2
AskReddit,"I was, inadvertently, once the creepiest thing in the woods.

I've been a Pagan since 1993. It's a serious religion involving the worship of gods and goddesses of pre-Christian Europe and in revering Nature.

So there was a secluded spot in the woods where my group and I used to hold our rituals. It wasn't deep in the woods. It was right off of a major road. But it was quiet enough so that we could practice our religion outdoors, in private.

We'd light a bonfire and worship. No weird sacrifices. Nothing nefarious. Despite the fact that we had a fire and wore hooded robes or other dark clothing, it's more New-Agey than sinister.

Also, I had a weird sense of humor.

So one night before ritual, one of the guys from my group was running late. I was waiting around for him in my robe. I saw headlights and assuming it was my friend, tried to look 'spooky'.

todayilearned,"&gt;No, you claimed (wrongly) that European colonialism was uniquely horrible in comparison to colonialism by other races.

What does this have to do with race? My main argument is that colonialism by capitalist countries (capitalism, which began in Europe) was uniquely horrible. The economic systems of the rest of the world simply did not provide the means to conduct such oppression until they ushered in capitalist market economies.

&gt;The USSR's war against Finland nicely illustrates that it wasn't just capitalist countries that were expansionist aggressors in WWII.

Yes, you are correct. Though that war was conducted by Stalin, arguably the most traitorous individual to Marxism-Leninism and the Soviet people. The USSR was a state capitalist society by the 1930s. What is your purpose in citing the Winter War?

&gt;So capitalism's an ideology, but Marxism isn't?
And what exactly do you mean by ""Japan appears in a much better condition than China""? That it's presented more favorably by the mainstream media? Or that its prospects as a country appear better?

No, capitalism is not an ideology. Neither is Marxism. Liberal capitalism and Marxism-Leninism, for example, are ideologies. Capitalism is an economic system; Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis--the ways in which one interpret Marxism constitute ideologies. As we like to say, Marxism is a ""Science"".

What I meant by the sarcastic term ""IdeologicalCapitalistMediaTreatement™"" is that U.S. demagogues and media sources will often cite China's ""lack of Western values"", preaching abstract ideas like ""democracy"" and ""freedom"". That is a feature of liberal capitalism, which seeks to spread its ""values"" to ""backwards nations"", so they implement parliamentary democratic government forms--which Lenin explains is the mode of government most fit for attempting to convince the working class of ""legitimate"" bourgeois rule.

What I mean is that since the relationship between U.S. and China is not good, and since the relationship between U.S. and Japan is good, U.S. media will portray Japan in a better light than China. That is how politics influence journalism.

&gt;Oh yeah, and Japan's as rich as it is because as bad as all the unpaid overtime and other abuse of workers in Japan is, none of its post-WWII abuses remotely compare to the way Mao starved millions of Chinese to death with the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution.

Where are you deriving your numbers from, and how can you *directly* attribute every single one of those deaths to an action or policy of Mao?

&gt;The point is that blaming whites for Africa's poverty is ridiculous.

Well, Western countries are regularly exploiting Africa for wage labor and capital. The exploiters simply happen to be white, and the oppressed folk happen to be black. Where there is money to be made, money will indeed be made. Though the elite of the elite of the West don't give a hoot where they get it from--hell, they're starting to turn certain European countries into 3rd world countries (ie. Greece w/ the troika). I can make no valuable assessment on the ability of modern African countries to govern, because they are constantly beset on all sides by the types of Western intervention that I cited in previous posts.

&gt;I hadn't heard of Sankara. I suppose that you think Amnesty International denounced him just because he was a threat to neo-colonialism? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sankara#Human_Rights_and_alleged_violations

Amnesty International is a mouthpiece of Western economic interests (just like HRW), so I accept nothing from them. I derive my interpretation of such events from the people who lived in the country in question, and their feelings. One will notice stark differences, for example, in how U.S. media portrays Gaddafi and how the Libyan people felt about him, and not the Libyan people you see on CNN or Al-Jazeera. The place is a hellhole now because the U.S. funded rebels, established a no-fly zone, and overthrew Gaddafi who had brought a wide array of social programs to the once scattered tribes of Africa. Though now you notice Hillary Clinton ""praises"" their ""efforts for democracy""--she means subservience to Western imperialism.

Also, if you know nothing about Sankara, did you just google him in the hunt for a good 'bad-point' to throw out there? Surely a greater effort can be made, and I doubt you would be able to learn enough about him to engage in coherent argument in the duration of this conversation.",cyivjq6,0,,1451756403,t1_cyifpmf,t3_3yz30f,1454226046,,1451700965,,False,0,t5_2qqjc,marxism-,1,1

argentina,"Qué bueno! por fin alguien quiere escuchar lo que tengo para decir. jaja^ja ^^ja

Con gusto lo haré, a pesar de que no soy ningún letrado.

-------------------

Comenzando con la literatura Argentina, en el siglo XIX el contexto de país nuevo no frenó a los intelectuales a crear contenidos, y aparece la conocida [generación del 37](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generaci%C3%B3n_del_37), que se componía de Sarmiento, Alberdi, Echeverría y María Guiterrez. A pesar de eso en el imaginario social tenemos burdamente 2 exponentes grandes en lo que es literatura, ellos son *Facundo*, que lo escribe Sarmiento, y el más conocido *Martín Fierro*. 

En realidad son los que yo leí, y me gustó más el *Martín Fierro* 

Ya entrado el siglo XX el contexto es otro, Argentina es un país más maduro y empieza a producir conocimiento. Quedarme en este caso solo con *Rayuela* puede ser poco. 

Ocurre que durante el siglo XX aparecen todo un montón de vanguardias nuevas y Argentina no queda exento de su influencia, tenés en la década del 20 los grupos ""Boedo"" y ""Florida"", estando el primero encabezado por Borges como su máximo representante, y el segundo por Roberto Arlt que escribe, por ejemplo, una fantástica obra existencialista como es *Los siete locos*.

*Boedo* era el representante de el arte Europeo, era todo importado de afuera, y por supuesto tenían un tinte mucho más aristocrático que *Florida,* quienes se enfocaron mucho más en los problemas sociales del siglo XX. 

Este tema es más profundo de lo que yo voy a poder escribirte acá, sobre todo porque hay tantos otros autores argentinos que yo nunca tuve ni la suerte de tener uno de sus libros en mis manos, y porque tengo que medirme para no mandar fruta, ja.   Podría llevarte una vida estudiar solo la literatura Argentina, me atrevo a decir... Y tal vez no terminarías. 

Del siglo XXI y de Argentina no conozco nada puntualmente, en parte porque todavía no existe un canon del que agarrarme, he leído sí algunos libros, pero... No sé, uno no puede juzgar la época que está viviendo, principalmente porque formamos parte de ella, además faltan 84 años más, che. 

Para dejar de escribir, vamos a lo que importa, resumido:

* Periodo clásico: fácil, *Odisea*, su contraparte Latina, *Eneida*, fue un texto fascinante para mí también

* Edad media: *La Chanson de Roland*, je

* Renacimiento: *Comedia*, de Dante Alighieri, tengo *Decamerón*, de Boccaccio para leer, aunque me gustaría conseguirlo en italiano. 

* Barroco: nunca lei nada.

* Neoclásico: Nada tampoco, que recuerde al meno

* Romanticismo: Conté hace poco que estaba leyendo la única novela de Allan Poe, *El relato de Arthur Gordon Pym*, quedé fascinado, mi elección sin dudas

* Realismo: *Tiempos Difíciles*, Charles Dickens, *Crimen y Castigo* también, aunque no sé si se cataloga a Dostoievski como moderno 

* Modernismo: *Por quién doblan las campanas*, Hemingway.

* Posmodernismo: Indiscutible, *La Náusea*, Sartre 

-----------------------

Tengo que insistir en que yo soy el paradigma de buen alumno, ni estoy cerca de serlo, tampoco tengo demasiadas lecturas en mi espalda pero espero poder decir, eventualmente, que leí lo suficiente. (ja).

 Espero también que te haya servido. A mi definitivamente me refrescó algunas cosas.

MilitaryPorn,"It's not quite as straightforward as that.  The Soviet Union had 6.4 million men and the Allies had 4 million-- about 3 million Americans and 1 million British Imperials-- in the ETO.  The Allies had better logistics and better planes.  The Soviets did build great tanks and planes, but they built the planes in limited quantities and they were heavily reliant on the Allies for raw materials.  It's often forgotten how much ""stuff"" the Soviets got from the West.  That stuff includes things like food, telephone wire, railroad rails, etc.  In peacetime that stuff could be manufactured or replaced by a large civilian workforce.  In this case there would be no replacing those things when they broke.  The raw materials weren't even available: steel, aluminum, nickel, and zinc were not being produced in any significant quantities due to the devastation and depopulation caused by the War.

I'll grant that they have something of a qualitative advantage in tanks, but not in every other kind of vehicle.  Combined, the Western Allies have over four times as many planes (fighters and bombers).  Their artillery may be equally good, but I would give the advantage to the Americans-- artillery is something the US was really really good at in WW2.  The British Army is in decline, but it's a veteran force.  The American Army is waxing in strength, but there's a big disparity in unit quality.  The Soviet units on the knife's edge are *very* good, but the rest of the army is poor to middling.  Don't forget that by this time the Soviet Army is also in decline.  Since 1944 the Soviets have been drafting men from their liberated areas straight into the army, usually with no training whatsoever.  The discipline issues and the total lack of tactical finesse was extraordinarily apparent in units composed of those soldiers.

So, with that in mind, let's wargame this for a second.  I'm going to ignore that, by December 1945, the US was producing a nuke a month, because we really don't know how we would have used the Bomb against the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Armies attack.  They need to project their armies into a western Germany that had been devastated by aerial attack in ways that the eastern half of Germany never had to face.  Their depots are further back than the Allies' depots.  Initially they'll have the allied-supplied trucks to do the job, but those will begin to break down or get destroyed. Allied airpower will make itself felt fairly rapidly and kick the logistic props out from under the Soviet Army.  The actual combat experience will vary according to what unit is facing what, but in general the Allies will be pushed back.  In some places they may even collapse, but the Soviet Army won't be able to exploit the advantage.  Allies bombers really can't reach the untouched Soviet industrial areas, so they'll focus on interdiction.  Eventually the Soviet advance would peter out.  An Allied counteroffensive would probably follow.  Given the Allies' military record it would likely be an unimaginative attack focused on the West's superiority of material.  It would be bloody and it would be ugly, but the Soviets would ultimately begin to give way.

Would the Soviet Army collapse?  Maybe.  Would the Western Allies have been able to invade the Soviet Union?  Probably not.  Would the Allies have been able to free Poland?  It's entirely possible.  One thing is certain: it would have been bloody as hell.

We'd basically know the answers before people answer them. Then you just fudge the divide, who can really say what left or right or centrist is, it depends on who labels them, so you can get away with labeling hardcore left or right the opposite or center. 

So on paper you'd get almost a perfect divide between ideologies and parties, when in reality its 100% fake, fixed poll. Depending who paid us we'd make the poll lean towards them.

evangelion,"I've compiled a chart of every Eva and related mech I could find from across the various continuities and organized them into categories for easy reference! The AAA Wunder isn't included on this chart as I feel it's more of a ship or a vehicle than an Eva.

**Edit:** [Here is an updated version.](http://i.imgur.com/RuRQ0eo.jpg) Rebuild Unit 01 has been updated and I added five more Evas: three in the Anima section and two in the Others.

Here's are some brief explanations of the Evas in the Anima section and below:

**-Anima-**

**Eva 00 F-type:** A rebuilt Unit 00 created from the core and spare parts from the original Eva 00 and parts of the F-type Armor. The right arm and leg were replaces with the ""Angel's Spine"" cannon and a prosthetic peg leg for better stability. Piloted by Rei III.

**Eva 00 F-type Allegorica:** Unit 00 equipped with the UX-1 Allegorica, a support unit enabling space flight.

**Eva 0.0:** Three special Eva Units built from parts from Unit 00 and the MP Evas and powered by the MP Evas' S2 engines. They are piloted by the clones Rei Quatre, Rei Cinq, and Rei Six. 0.0 Quatre is later modified with a darker color scheme, a head fin, and is powered by a QR Signum engine. Rei Cinq and her Eva are killed saving Asuka from Armaros' Sphere of Longinus.

**Eva 0.0 Space Gear:** The Rei clones use a mental link to form the Sword of Damocles network. Two of them are stationed in space and one on Earth, allowing them to coordinate attacks anywhere on Earth.

**Eva 01 F-type:** Eva Unit 01 equipped with the F-Type [A.T. Field Control Experiment] armor. It deploys against the Mass Production Evangelions and destroys them, saving Asuka and preventing Third Impact.

**Eva 01 Stage 2 Spec.:** An upgraded form of Eva 01 designed to use the B-type equipment. It is refit with F-type equipment after compatibility issues with the S2 engine arise. I'm not really sure if this form was ever used.

**Super Evangelion:** The third form of Eva 01.  After being severely damaged by Rei Quatre in chapter 04, Shinji's body and soul are merged with Unit 01 in Yui's place, and it rebuilds itself as the Super Evangelion. Eva 01 effectively becomes Shinji's second body.

**Super Eva Final Stage:** The final perfected evolution of Eva 01. This form first appears in Section 3 of Anima following awakening of Super Evangelion. It and Super Eva can fly using the Vortex support unit.

**Giant of Light:** During a battle with Armaros in Section 2 Finale, Super Evangelion awakens and is encased in a glowing energy shell that takes on Adam's shape. Like the Rebuild Unit 01, wings of light emerge from its chest and it is able to form glowing limbs. Later in section 3, the Eva is able to assume a massive form made of light to fight Armaros. Anima Shinji is apparently an aspect of Adam, which is why it takes on this form.

**02 Type II:** Upgraded form of Eva 02.

**02 Type II Allegorica:** Unit 02 Type II equipped with special armor designed for use with the UX-1 Allegorica support unit that gives it the appearance of a winged silver centaur. It's powered by an N2 reactor and is sent to fight Armaros on the moon.

**Crimson A1:** In space, Asuka and Unit 02 are infected with some kind of microorganism and fuse together, becoming the hybrid being Crimson A1. The Allegorica is integrated into the Crimson A1's body as her twintails. She is later tricked into becoming an enemy by one of the Torwarts and is renamed Torwartα1. She is restored to normal and takes part in the final battle with Armaros.

**Eva EUROII Huertebize:** A European Evangelion built from a prototype for Eva 02 and piloted by a brainwashed Hikari. She continues to pilot it after being freed.

**US Evangelion/WOLFPAC:** An enormous quadruped Evangelion created by the US and piloted by Mari. It can fire lasers from its mouth and has a beast form similar to Code 777. Note: I'm assuming these two Evas are actually the same. The first Eva's name is written as USエヴアビ‐ス卜/ウルフパックは  while the Beast Wolfpac's is written as US エヴァンゲリオン/ウルフパツク

**Angel Carrier:** Evas built from the remains of the Mass Production Evas. Their empty chest cavity holds a sphere containing part of an Angel, allowing them to use the Angel's powers. They are powered by a QR Signums derived from Armaros.

**Armaros:** A mysterious black Evangelion that appears on the moon and the primary antagonist of Anima. It weilds the original Lance of Longinus, has a golden halo behind its head, and strongly resembles Eva Mark.06 in black knight armor. It is the source of the QR Signum engines (the red and black shapes) used by several Evas in the series. It is heavily damaged by an awakened Super Eva at the end of Section 2, but reappears in a new form in Section 3, apparently after defeating and absorbing Eva EUROII Huertebize. 

**Armaros Second Form:** Armaros as it appears in Section 3. It is much bulkier and has more ornate armor than its first form, and the head design is altered so that it resembles Unit 02 wearing a bat-wing helmet. It is able to transform into a colossal Black Giant and has extendable arms connected by inky black tendrils. I've read that Armaros is a black Adam.

**Torwarts:** Two black Evas that work as henchmen for Armaros. One is destroyed, the other somehow comes into possession of Shinji's heart and becomes his second body in Super Eva's place for a while. I believe it uses this to trick Crimson A1.

**Eva 01 Type QCB:** A concept Eva 01 upgrade appearing only in the Anima Visual Book. It has a folding horn and twin handguns equipped with crescent blades.

**Eva 02 F-type:** Unit 02 in the F-type armor. Appears in the Visual Book, as a figurine, and in a pachinko game as the Rebuild Unit 02 in Evangelion X pachinko along with Units 01 and 02.

**-Other Evas-**

**Evangelion Unit-α:** A secret Seele Evangelion appearing in Evangelion Battle Orchestra. It's piloted by a Rei dummy plug and is equipped with six independetly functioning drones similar to Eva 13's RS Hoppers that fire powerful lasers. Apparently scrapped.

**Evangelion Type β:** Sister unit to Unit-α, piloted by Kaworu in Detective Evangelion and Battle Orchestra. Another special Seele Evangelion that leads the Mass Production Evas and serves as the final boss in both games. It is equipped with a flaming heat katana and has light wings stored in the pylons on its back. It can operate autonomously, possibly through a dummy plug. Destroyed by Unit 01 after trying to initiate Third Impact.

**Type β Awakened:** In the final case of Detective Evangelion, an unmanned Type β breaks into Terminal Dogma and devours Kaworu. After a battle with Units 00, 01, and 02, it is encased in a ball of feathers and emerges with four wings, a thorny halo, and glowing lines along its body. It transforms Terminal Dogma into a stormy landscape with a destroyed city in the distance and a circular vortex swirling overhead. Destroyed by Unit 01.

**Another Number - Unit Null:** Mystery Eva appearing in the Animator Expo short ""Evangelion - Another Impact [Confidential]."" It goes berserk during an activation test and rampages around a desolate city before causing some kind of mini-Impact. Possibly piloted by Rei.

**Unit 01 Goddess:** Concept design for Unit 01's final evolution shown in Sore wo Nasumono. Unit 01 appears with similar blue hair in its last scene in End of Evangelion and one ending of Evangelion 2.

**Dummy Plug Eva:** A concept Eva design from Sore wo Nasumono.

**Nimrod/Dadalus:** A concept Eva design from Sore wo Nasumono. Its arms are sealed within its chest plate, a feature later appearing on Eva 13.

**Puchi Eva 01:** Unit 01 as it appears in Petit Eva: Evangelion@School. A human-sized juvenile delinquent robot that attends school with Shinji and friends. Appears to be male and can grow into a giant when hooked up to a power cable.

**00' F-type:** Unit 00' equipped with F-type armor. Appears as a figure.

**Eva-Impact Final Battle Weapon Type Horse:** An Eva created as part of a cross-promotion with the Japan Racing Association. Combines Eva technology with thoroughbred horse DNA.

**-Mecha-**

**Jet Alone Prime:** Second iteration of the Jet Alone from Evangelion 2. It's equipped with an N2 reactor that requires a lot of water for cooling. With the right relationship values, it will show up during the End of Evangelion to aid in the fight with the Mass Production Evangelions. It is very powerful and can quickly dispatch an MP Eva with its warhammer.

**T•RIDEN•T:** Two JSSDF-designed weapons from Girlfriend of Steel 2. Piloted by Mana Kirishima, Musashi Lee Strasberg and Keita Asari. They are both destroyed over the course of the game, the second after going berserk.

**Akashima:** Two-man transforming mech produced by the JSSDF and NERV JPN in Evangelion Anima. They are powered by N2 reactors and can transform into a flight mode.

**Simulation body:** Used in NGE for synchronization tests. Taken over by Ireul.

**Eva Simulator:** Appears in 1.0 as part of Shinji's training.",cyiz5k7,0,,1451771104,t3_3z3mgn,t3_3z3mgn,1454227815,,1451708263,,False,0,t5_2r6ex,LFiM,26,26

nottheonion,"Germany's pre-war economic success is a widespread myth. The Nazis relied on work heavily subsidized with public money. Germany's own industry save road construction and the military-industrial complex didn't profit from Adolf Hitler’s politics.


[Pre-war economy: 1933–1939](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#Pre-war_economy:_1933.E2.80.931939)

&gt;At first, Schacht continued the economic policies introduced by the government of Kurt von Schleicher in 1932 to combat the effects of the Great Depression. The inherited policies included a **large public works programs supported by deficit spending** – such as the construction of the Autobahn network – to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment. There was major reduction in unemployment over the following years, **while price controls prevented the recurrence of inflation**.

&gt;...

&gt;The consequence was an extremely rapid decline in unemployment – the most rapid decline in unemployment in any country during the Great Depression. But whether this helped the average German is a matter of debate—while more Germans had jobs, a **focus on rearmament meant rationing in food, clothing, metal, and wood for most citizens. Rationing eventually extended to use of fuel and production of cars, leaving many Germans unable to drive**.

&gt;...

&gt;In June 1933, the ""Reinhardt Program"" for infrastructure development was introduced. It combined indirect incentives, such as **tax reductions, with direct public investment in waterways, railroads and highways**. It was followed by similar initiatives resulting in great expansion of the German construction industry. Between 1933 and 1936, employment in construction rose from only **666,000 to over 2,000,000**.

&gt;...

&gt;In 1936, military spending in Germany exceeded 10% of GNP, higher than any other European country at the time, after years of limitations imposed by the Versailles Treaty. Military investment also exceeded civilian investment from 1936 onwards.  
&gt;The German balance of payments went strongly negative. **In 1933-36 exports declined by 9% in value while imports rose by 9%**. In the spring and summer of 1936, the reduced availability of foreign currency constrained imports of raw materials, with some key stockpiles falling to only two months' production. Dr. Schacht informed the War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg that lack of lead and copper prevented fulfilling his requests for increased military production.

Anybody and their grandma can get people into publicly funded work if you can print your money and rely on invading neighboring countries because you've spent everything on your highways and your military.

worldnews,"&gt; On Reddit, all the untested Russian hardware is infallible, and all the battle tested Western hardware is old junk

you summed up /r/worldnews

The best part is China can't even catch up to Russia and steals from them (and US) yet claim it's 100% indigenous.

I think I read somewhere Israeli pilots have been training with S300 for years just in case they are needed. 

Also, it's very easy to acquire or get people to spy for you in places like Russia and China, because these people make a lot less than their American or European counterparts, no meaningful pension plan, family to take care of etc. So much upperhand the CIA has over their adversaries because of money, and they can give a colonel's nephew and nieces piece of the American life. Soviet Union was one example where American intelligence were repeatedly successful in acquiring Soviet weaponry and technology. In one instance, a Russian pilot flew the latest MIG to Japan, and the West was able to take the plane apart, rendering Soviet Union's latest Friend-or-Foe identification system in aircraft useless.

Putin does seem hell bent on using the S400 to make a point but I think it's a plus for NATO as well since they would just have another Russian air defense weapon to neutralize and circumvent, just like they have successfully for decades since the cold war ended, which actually made the Russian military complex much more porous to large wads of cash.

conspiracy,"I believe Bernie Sanders when he states that he doesn't hold dual citizenship. But the belief persists simply because so many Jewish-Americans at top levels in government *are* dual citizens. In fact, Jews spearheaded the legalization of dual citizenship in America. (It happened in 1967, with the case of a Jewish-American named Beys Afroyim. He voted in an Israeli election and faced having his US citizenship stripped. A Mexican-American in the 1950s *did* have his citizenshop stripped for voting in a Mexican election. [See the court case of Perez vs. Brownell].

Jewish lobby groups were silent when Mr. Perez was stripped of his citizenship, but they sprang into action when Beys Afroyim faced a similar fate. By 1967, they had amassed enough political clout (and attained enough judgeships in the judiciary, to have the long-standing law overturned, and dual citizenship ushered in).

Dual citizenship was illegal for most of US history. And the Founding Fathers were explicitly against it. In fact, almost everyone was well into the 20th Century [read: Teddy Roosevelt's comments on it. He was aggressively against what we today call ""multiculturalism""].

This changed with Jewish lobby groups asserting political pressure to institute dual citizenship to allow them to live and vote in both the US and Israel.

So, in 1967, the law changed to accommodate them.

They didn't just press for it in America, either. They lobbied for it in most Western countries (after Israel was founded in 1948), and even in the Soviet Union. Stalin's code-word for Jews was ""rootless cosmopolitans"" due to their penchant for internationalism, and their propensity to slip from country to country. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootless_cosmopolitan

Due to their peculiar history, Jews were distinguished from other groups by their relative disconnect from the soil upon which they lived and their indifference to modern national borders. Historically, Jews in Russia didn't speak Russian at home, but Yiddish. These Yiddish-speakers could easily slip between borders and move to Yiddish-speaking communities in Romania, Hungary, Austria or Germany without changing their language, diet, culture or dress. A Jew from Poland was far more culturally similar to a Jew from France than he was to an ethnic Pole who lived just a few villages over. 

These unique historical factors did a lot to shape their well-attested impulse toward internationalism.

This habit of globalism was also fostered by their mercantile enterprises, which saw them spread to most of the capitals of Europe [and beyond].

Precisely because Jews are so famous for their ""rootless comospolitanism,"" and because so many US Jewish politicians legitimately DO have dual citizenship to Israel, it's easy to make the assumption that Bernie Sanders has done like so many before him.

But, alas, it looks like (on the evidence we have at hand) he is not a legitimate dual citizen--as Scooter Libby is, or Douglas Feith.

I take Bernie at his word. (Although I do have to point out that Bernie's parents may not have opted for dual citizenship as immigrants to the US in 1917 precisely because, in 1917, dual citizenship in America was illegal--and Israel didn't yet exist. So Bernie frames it as their patriotism to America precluding it. But the reality is: Due to their generation (and the law at the time) it wouldn't have been an option. Bernie himself was born seven years before Israel was founded, and twenty-six years before dual citizenship was legal in America.)",cyj0pk6,0,,1451712579,t3_3z1r7l,t3_3z1r7l,1454228548,,1451711581,,False,0,t5_2qh4r,Drooperdoo,0,0

I agree that ""our traditional"" is strange as well because I have no idea where the OP is from or what calendar they might use. 

Anyway the Gregorian is solar right? 365 days a year and 366 days every 4th year to make up for the quarter days lopped off. 12 months and 30 or so days a month. China has a solar calendar. The Buddhist and Muslim calendars are lunar. Is the Jewish calendar lunar as well? Were the Native American or African calendars popularly known or was it just something for Priests and Royalty? Obviously people kept track of seasons and days but did average polloi divide their days up into weeks and months with names? 

The Babylonians divided the day up according to their base 12 system. 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, 60 seconds in a minute (I actually don't know if the Mesopotamians bothered with seconds). It's almost perfectly reflective of how it actually works. Modern European thinkers have bandied about alternatives to that like a base 10 system to be more in line with the SI. So a POD that overthrew the ancient or religious calendars in the name of modern science but actually had it stick would be plausible but then ""our traditional"" nixes that possibility.

For me this DBWI seems to imply a waning Western influence early on. Perhaps an earlier World War 1 type conflict brings the colonial period to a close before the 20th century or perhaps the Ming dynasty never falls to Confucian navel-gazing and an exploring, trading, culturally expansionist China is a major player throughout the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries both stifling and inflaming Muslim development and Europe as well.

It doesn't seem like it from the content of the news, but the news organizations have been casting wider and wider nets to get their Bloodiest Stories of the Day. Reporting the corruption of police and government officials remains a Thing We Do.

You're thinking micro. Start thinking Macro. Everything you've said in that paragraph has already happened thousands of years ago in civilizations that no longer exist. The question you should be asking is; Why don't they exist anymore?

&gt;ust taking the U.S. as an example, we've been down the road of McCarthyism before, and recently. We're apparently doomed to go down that road again, since we failed to learn our history. But we'll do it, and we'll come out the other side with greater understanding and better records.

I get the impression you believe the U.S. will exist in perpetuity.

&gt;We fail sometimes, often when we collectively get scared shitless for a while and it takes us time to recover, but we get past it and the pendulum swings back the other way.

This is absolutely true. However, it's consistently done through revolutions and war. The last time the pendulum swung was with the American and French revolutions, when the Europeans went away from feudalism into self government. It is currently swinging back towards tyranny and slavery, just like it has every other time.

&gt;We've come so far from the days of feudalism and leeches and rampant tribalism 

These are the same thoughts the Athenians and Romans had as well. 

&gt;I find it hard to imagine that we can't figure out how to somehow keep rampant capitalism and ""entertainment journalism"" in check.

These are old problems disguised as new problems. The human race has been dealing with these questions for millennia. Again, the driving factor has always been greed.

&gt;Hmm. Ok. So we're going with the whole enlightenment thing are we? Well. Turns out a lot of the people who put those ideas forward, like Immanuel Kant, John Locke, David Hume etc. were in fact massive racists. That's the thing about the Enlightenment, it only really applied to White people, Africans and the like weren't considered sophisticated or capable enough to do it (which was fortunate, because it made enslaving them much more justifiable).

**Great, fuck the Africans and fuck the fact that the philosophers were racist.** Literally everyone was racist and they were racist because while we were in europe building castles there were mud huts when we colonized the Congo. Everyone in that time period were racist so much so that we put blacks in collars and chains and sold them for less than we would sell a cow your framing of history as social justice is disgusting and you should consider why you are throwing away your family's achievements.

 
&gt;Also, Europe's been sooo great at following that whole ""consent of the governed"" thing, since until the late 19th Century, and into the 20th ""democracy"" was considered a dirty word, or insult, and within living memory three of Europe's biggest economies were fascist dictatorships, and up until the early/mid 90's half of Europe were Eastern Bloc dictatorships.

politics,"&gt; Why don't you tell me what Robert Jervis's degree is in then. Because all of the pages about him indicate that he is a political science major and is an international politics professor. It seems to me that if he had a degree in psychology, he wouldn't be teaching political science classes. Especially if he had a Ph.D. in psychology. Now maybe in his books he deals with psychology light in some of his theories, and I would agree that psychology deserves a more respected place in most fields, but he isn't a psychologist. Now instead of making me look up something you apparently know, why don't you just say it?

He has a bachelor's in psychology and a PhD in IR.   His whole field of expertise is in decision-making on a geopolitical level. So when you say that psychology doesn't intersect with international relations, there's an incredibly gifted and influential person that has been very impactful saying exactly otherwise.

Unless you think psychology doesn't have anything to with decision-making, I guess.

This revolt is an instance of a much more general phenomenon, a new unwillingness to submit to any rule or necessity the rationale of which man does not understand; it makes itself felt in many fields of life, particularly in that of morals; and it is often a commendable attitude. But there are fields where this craving for intelligibility cannot be fully satisfied and where at the same time a refusal to submit to anything we cannot understand must lead to the destruction of our civilization.""

I think your side-note about ""qualification"" is a bit high-minded. Moreover, I don't think it necessarily always has the positive effect that you postulate. I'm not convinced that, if politics were rendered entirely bereft of rhetoric, that Democracy would suddenly become an entirely healthy venture. This is to put a disturbing amount of trust in the natural regulatory ability of a system that has no reason to be anything but chaotic. It's reminiscent of the invisible hand of the market, but our god in this instance is the demos. Broadly, I think we can accept that a certain degree of artifice is nearly always justified in thrall to high-minded goals, at least in most self-contained ideological systems.

&gt;I find it fascinating that, of all the policy fields with which to break party lines, you choose economic policy; as this runs counter to most established theory I have read

I'm not trying to be nor am I a particularly unique thinker or special snowflake. Traditionally, as you may know, Western Marxism and liberalism have competed with each other for ideological relevance in the Western academic/intellectual landscape. Western Marxism has won many battles against liberalism in recent years - and rightly so. An ideology based on free will should be regarded the contemporary frontier of metaphysics, the prior battle being atheism versus religion.

To some, as you might imagine, neither ideology is quite sufficient - but opportunities to develop an entirely separate methodology are surprisingly sparse, and the hegemony of thinkers who have already carved out this place in the sociological and political landscape have laid the groundwork for a self-perpetuating and justifying ideology. In Europe, the movement with which you could broadly align me has gained a surprising amount of traction (both intellectual and populist), coalescing into nationalist, identitarian groups with surprising political and intellectual breadth. Surely, you've gotten an ear full from the detractors of these groups, but I can assure you that to simply dismiss their incipience out of hand is not only small-minded, but also a losing strategy.

It is, however, in some of these limitations of our intellectual hegemony I've mentioned (along with other, more pejorative factors that opposition to populist movements like to emphasize, such as economic and social alienation broadly) that an alternative right has arisen. We needn't get into specifics that might make you a bit queasy, but the doctrine, generally, seeks to develop a methodology of the right wing that is post-Biblical and post-scientific method. In this view, the traditional right flags not in their conclusions per se, but in their methods. The alternative right seeks to make ideology as consistent with reality as possible through a form of skeptical hyper-materialism predicated on a reassessment of nearly all that has been unchallenged or taken for granted. The ideology is empowered, not alienated by contrarianism, which broadens the realm of permissible questions that may be proscribed by the moral and social framework of more mainstream ideologies.

Now, the modern left has, sadly, developed an unfortunate relationship with science, and doesn't have the intellectual and moral tools to contend with a developing reality - a reality that is in some ways, quite regressive, in that we are now regressing backwards to find utility in the apparent arbitrary foolishness of our forefathers. I don't want the conversation to get incendiary, but the left's tragic denial of developments in our understanding of how human biology works (particularly heritability) has loomed as an ominous specter, handicapping sound judgment in nearly every political and social endeavor. The short-sightedness and over-reliance on knee-jerk moral vectors such as care/harm (I don't mean to sound like Darth Vader here, I'm using Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory to pathologize excessive focus on only one moral vector, as Haidt himself does) severely limits the intellectual breadth of the modern left, and leads them to numerous erroneous conclusions. 

Obviously, conversely, my distaste for the mainstream right is possibly even more intense, as we always reserve our greatest sanction for members of the apparent ""in-group"" that have not met our standards.

In any case, this is getting a bit lengthy. I can't really give you an adequate explanation because my brain can only parse so much information at a given time, and much more of it is relevant, especially because you're dealing with new ideas that may scare or upset you.

worldnews,"&gt;Inovation is something that China and culturally Chinese individuals have a major issue with

To asset that the Chinese are innovative betrays an egregious ignorance of human intellectual and cultural history. 

 They were streaks ahead of the West from the fall of the Roman Empire until the Renaissance, and heir to a plethora of civilisational innovations across the centuries, from an independent Neolithic Revolution and writing system, to one of the great philosophical cultures of the Axial Age, to the technological innovations of dynastic China. They have arguably the world's greatest tradition of literature and fine. 

&gt;Japanese culture is superior to Chinese culture in regards to inovation though it still has similar handicaps and they could never surpass Europe. 

I'd say the Japanese surpassed Europe in the 1980's - they produce better vehicles, better computer games, better hi-tech devices, better movies, better popular culture..

Otherwise I agree with you - China will be just like Japan, they'll catch up and surpass.

soccer,"It can only be good at this point. quote me on this in a few months but Im 100% sure Wenger will bottle it this year as well. I mean, United still won titles under Fergie. How bad can replacing Wenger really be? I'd take a chance to win something any day vs never winning anything at all because of Arsene's stubbornness and transfertactics from the stone-age. It's not really exciting anymore getting 4th either these days, because the round of 16 is the furthers Wenger will ever go because of his shitty tactics in Europe always ends up with Arsenal getting 2nd in the group; facing a #1 like Bayern/Barca. Always the same story, year in , year out.


The most important figures have left ages ago, David Dein and co. After that we never achieved anything of note, of course English ppl will think the 2x FA means something, but it's a worthless cup.



Fergie also left at a perfect time (for him). He actually screwed up his squadbuilding this time and was left with an old aging squad lacking the proper new blood from the youth department. Aquiring RvP (and him basicly doing the same as with Arsenal the year before, often saving them from drawing games in the final 15mins) sqeezed the life out of the team, great transfer to get one last premier league title and a stark contrast to Wengers transfer dealings (he would've never bought RvP would he have been in Sir Alex's position). Arsenal hasn't got a squad in such a decline and with a right manager and proper investment can look much better than they do now. How about a manager with the balls to buy a proper 40mil striker for once? Or what about a manager who does believe in a proper CDM? Wouldn't that work wonders for our midfield? Imagine a player like carrick or heck, guardado from PSV in our lineup. Would balance it all out so much more.

Never set foot in south east Asia or Algeria.

I'll fight for France **without a doubt**.

That's my home. It's worth fighting for.

But I am enough clever to realize assimilation can only work if the number of immigrants is controlled. Even more when the religion is incompatible with the Autochthones' one.

So yeah for me since 40 years immigration became a business and a disguised invasion destined to break the souls of European nations.

(See *Regroupement familial*)

America is Israel's bitch and Israel is capitalizing on the civilization conflict. That's why this racism bullshit is a good goy thing to my eyes. White against all the rest is going to lead to WW3 and guerrilla war on European soil. Instead of controlling immigration and favoring *remigration*.

I'll add that like always in French History we have a lot of heads to cut but the head of Mouloud the Arab Hallal butcher isn't one of them or even a priority.

I think remigration is good.

canada,"What a long winded article, with no bother to delve into the real causes, or history of, ""newly-founded,"" aversion to winter.  This article tends to lean towards another explanation; suggesting that our poor attitude is what is making us soft.

In the late 1800s, early 1900s, Minister of the Interior, Clifford Sifton was seeking to attract immigrants from Europe to settle in the praries.  A conscious effort was made by the government to downplay the harsh Canadian winter.  All of the elaborate promotional material to attract Europeans revolved around pictures and stories of Canada in the *summertime*. Even to this day, Canada continues to receive many immigrants who do not bring any appreciation for winter.

Although there is nothing specifically mentioned in anything I have read on this matter, I would also be willing to wager that the decimation of indigenous culture was a strong guarantee that any native traditions, teachings, and ceremonies, about Canadian winter would never to be absorbed into the greater Canadian culture; many aspects likely disappearing forever.

Over the years, we have lost a lot of our heritage and celebration of winter.  It has been cumulative, and it has had nothing to do with our sad attitudes, or the comforts we have become accustomed to.  Countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia have every winter luxury we do, and every reason to be as glum about the cold as we do, but have held onto their winter traditions.  Why?  It is not because they are tougher, or better built for it, but because they never experienced any sort of systematic attack on the idea of winter, nor any significant influx of individuals for whom winter was a strange concept.  Nobody was steering their people to think winter is something that must be endured, not enjoyed.

We simply have a population of people who have no idea what the hell to do during anymore when the snow falls!",cyj5ijd,0,Ontario,1451726491,t3_3z47rv,t3_3z47rv,1454230883,,1451724924,ON,False,0,t5_2qh68,hafetysazard,4,4
syriancivilwar,"I never said Arabs were lazy.  I said *for some of them* their main problem is with power, even a shred of it, their officers and NCO's hoard it like misers and are massive assholes.  So do not twist what I said.  I said their leaders have a tendency to be massive fucking, pretentious douchebags so I see interactions where during training a bunch of young officers are learning how a cannon works, including other foreign nationals from places like East Asia, Turkey, and Europe and are all pitching in listening the the subject matter expert, who is a young enlisted soldier, while the Saudi Arabian student is sitting in the shade with his legs crossed looking at his phone the whole day and telling the expert he has nothing to teach them and waving his hand at him like he's a dog.  His other Saudi peer?  He didn't even show up that day.  These are supposed to be the cream of the crop sent to a prestigious school overseas.

&gt; the point is that if they are ""bad"" it is because their armies failed to make them ""good"".

The point is their armies are not made and led by non Arabs so the failings of their armies are the failings of Arabs no matter how much you stamp your foot in anger.  The Turks have created a decent professional force for themselves, for example.

&gt;That's it. If you don't think that history, and by extension the culture born out if it, could be used as an explanation to the current day situation, why are blaming SAA's short-comings on Arabs being lazy?

Your example of Arabs successes on the field of battle a 1000 years ago is still irrelevant to the extreme.  I think Arab culture is a lot older than Mohammed and Islam and you just can't distinguish between the success of an Arab army winning wars fighting them the way they wanted to and modern Arab states having shitty militaries made in the image of modern, western style armed forces.  And SAA's problems lie far deeper than what I said, which again, was nothing to do with laziness.

Israel,"This is the idea that because of the gap of power between Israel and the Palestinians, peace is impossible, as it requires mutual concessions, and Israel being in the position of power can not be compelled, while Palestinians being in a position of weakness have nothing to concede. The logical conclusion that follows from this view is that in order to achieve peace, Israel needs to be weakened and Palestinians propped up. This view has been a cornerstone of Israeli left's peace politics for decades in various forms.  It has been pronounced with various degrees of explicitness in leftwing publications and has a deep and profound residence in the peace camp's mentality. 

One of the practical consequences of this view, openly endorsed by e.g. Ilan Pappe and practiced for example by Breaking the Silence organization, is that facts and truth can and should be ignored if they contradict the bigger goal of peace. The natural alternative - the assessment of relationship between Israel and Palestinians in terms of cultural ordinality (i.e. that Palestinian culture is violent) - is unacceptable to the left because it is politically incorrect and prima facie indistinguishable from racism. It is not just acceptable but also necessary to lie to establish the international public opinion that would tie Israel's hands and force it into negotiation from the artificially induced position of equality (Cast Lead ""investigations"", Mavi Marmara and so on, up to the latest BtS scandal, are a solid testimony to the existence and persistence of this view), based on the expectation that if restrictions are imposed against Israel that prevent it from effectively countering Palestinian violence, then Israel would be forced to experience the *intended* effect of the terrorism and consider the Palestinian views and demands on par with its own.

As these are strange views inconsistent with reality they are inevitably bound to produce strange and inconsistent results: pro-Palestinian European and Israeli leftwingers find themselves propping up extreme right wing Palestinian organizations, western LGBT activists advocate solidarity with people who would murder them on the spot, supporters of Irish independence advocate the equivalent of ethnic cleansing of Britain and the displacement of its population with Irish, human rights and anti-war organizations openly advocating against human rights and for war, and so on.

EDH,"As I said in my other post; your stated approach has problems. If you don't have a broad language pool to draw from, your, ""reach[ing] out to commander groups at randomly selected LGSs worldwide,"" actually means, ""Western Europe and North America."" Being able to pull from most of the languages Magic is printed in certainly makes that easier, but there are still lots of the world you can't talk to. Yeah, 30 was certainly an exaggeration but you seemed to have gotten my point. A rules committee that's entirely English speaking can only make rules from the English speaking players' perspective, and that leaves out a huge portion of the world that could be playing the format.

Without being willing to test decks from other metas, you will have very little useful knowledge to be able to collate all of the data you do get, and your Rules Committee would appear to behave the way Sheldon's is accused of acting, making rules to fit your meta and logic, irrespective of your actual process. 

Asking ""what do you think of X new rule to commander"" isn't a good question for gathering data about how the game is played, because it's so narrow and after the fact. Surveying decklists with a short summary of the local meta would do far more to help your committee better understand and contextualize not only what people think of your rules, it also lets you better source where these rule changes are coming from.

One of the reasons this thread was made was pretty much a response to a group of people complaining about the current RC making rules changes not representative of them or their metas, and not doing anything about that will doom any attempt at replacing the RC.",cyj62xo,0,,False,t1_cyj5muj,t3_3z2xig,1454231150,,1451727166,,False,0,t5_2scee,Zeful,-21,-21

American cars in the 90s didn't have that option aside from the fox body mustang. Also in Japan the 240sx was called the 180sx and had a 2.0l turbo engine that could be easily modified. The skylines had a 2.0l single turbo inline 6. Both of these cars are ideal. They are cheap to fix and parts are plentiful. 

Then there's cars like the Toyota supra. Name me a car from the late 90s that had 286hp with a 3.0l engine. Same goes for the 300zx.

brasil,"Se prepare para um post longo (só sei escrever textão!).

Não posso te ajudar em absolutamente NADA no que diz respeito a dicas de como ter uma vida organizada, já que minha vida é uma grande bagunça; mas, sendo professor de Inglês, posso te oferecer umas dicas de como aprender Inglês.

Antes de mais nada, ser fluente em Inglês, ou qualquer língua é uma questão de experiência. Aprender o básico da língua é relativamente rápido. A proficiência, ou seja, a maneira como a língua é usada de verdade, isso leva tempo. É a mesma coisa que eu te ensinar a conjugar os verbos no Português e te dizer que você sabe tudo de Português. Não é assim. Pessoas que falam fluentemente têm tido contato com a língua há muito tempo, pelo menos uns 10 anos, talvez ainda mais. Eu aprendi Inglês quando eu era pequeno. Hoje, com mais de 30 anos, é claro que eu falo muito bem, afinal, tenho contato com a língua há 30 anos, e sempre usei-a no dia-a-dia. A internet absolutamente me força a usar o Inglês todos os dias, já que a ampla maioria dos sites que eu costumo ler são em Inglês - sejam eles de notícias, opiniões, fóruns, etc. Então, tenha em mente que fluência em Inglês deve ser um projeto de longo prazo e um processo de aprendizagem contínuo. Não espere que você vá ser proficiente dentro de 3 anos. Not going to happen. Conheço gente que morou na Inglaterra por 5 anos cujo Inglês dá vergonha. Mas em 3 anos já dá para saber Inglês suficiente para ter uma comunicação adequada com nativos.

Com relação à parte técnica, de como aprender Inglês, ofereço as seguintes dicas:

Inglês não é Português! Simplifique sua vida. Não crie complicações onde não deveria existir. Não lute contra a língua. Como assim? Tipo, ficar criando dificuldades do tipo ""Por que eles falam dessa forma, e não dessa?"", ""Por que eles falam assim, e não assim?""

PREPOSIÇÕES! Aprenda as preposições junto com as palavras. Como assim? Te dou um exemplo? Em Português, quando uma coisa depende de outra coisa, ela depende *de. Daí você pensa, *""Ah tá. Então em Inglês deve ser *depends *of. Correto? Pois depende-&gt;depends, e de-&gt;of.""* Errado! Em Inglês, uma coisa depends *on. Mas, como assim? *On não significa sobre em Inglês? Sim. Então eles falam depende sobre? SIM! **INGLÊS NÃO É PORTUGUÊS! Cada verbo é geralmente usado com uma certa preposição. Não dá pra ficar traduzindo do Português para Inglês diretamente que fica esquisito.

Tente imitar o sotaque dos nativos. Pode ser Inglês Britânico ou Americano. Tanto faz. Americano é mais comum, hoje em dia, porque tem muito entretenimento em Inglês com sotaque Americano. Mas, o importante é tentar imitar o sotaque deles. Muita gente vai te dizer que isso é irrelevante. Grande besteira. Tentar imitar o sotaque vai acelerar teu aprendizado pois você entenderá o que estão falando mais rapidamente. Se você imitar o sotaque brasileiro do teu professor de Inglês, você vai entender apenas o sotaque do teu professor. Crianças Americanas aprendem o sotaque da mãe, e do pai, mas todo mundo têm o sotaque deles. O sotaque é difícil de imitar no começo, mas você precisa se acostumar a pronunciar da forma correta desde o começo. Não subestime essa parte. Ela é frequentemente ignorada. O resultado é o que eu vejo frequentemente por aí: ""Eu leio e entendo tudo que está escrito, mas na hora de ouvir o Inglês, eu não entendo nada!"" Por que será?

Segue umas dicas de pronúncia que farão o teu Inglês melhorar em 100%:

Atenção especial às consoantes no final das palavras. Em Português, não costumamos pronunciar consoantes no final das palavras. Como assim? Pegue a palavra ""Sal"" como exemplo. O ""L"" do final não pronunciado como o ""L"" de leite. Dizemos uma coisa do tipo ""Sau"". Mas no Inglês não é assim! Então teríamos que pronunciar o ""L"" em sal da mesma forma como o ""L"" em leite. Outro exemplo: ""N"" em sun é pronunciado como o ""N"" em não. Brasileiro tem mania de pronunciar como ""M"". Tá errado.

Eu te suplico! NÃO pronuncie o ""T"" como o ""CH"" Brasileiro. O ""T"" em Inglês tem um som completamente diferente do ""T"" como a gente geralmente fala ""leite"". Falamos, de fato, ""lei-chi"". *Mas no Inglês não é assim!** Se você falar What como muitos falam por aí, ""wa-ch"" tá errado. Parece que você tá falando *relógio de pulso em Inglês watch, ou observar. Não imite o sotaque do teu professor de Inglês Brasileiro. Imite o sotaque do Obama, da Hillary Clinton, da Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lawrence, sei lá. Menos o sotaque do teu professor brasileiro de Inglês!

It's not lazy, it's my fucking job.

Learn to differentiate when its appropriate to use dollars and/or the local currency. I can't believe some adults still need this shit explained for them. I learned this when I was still in school.

If the currency is a highly traded, well-known one, such as the $ (US, CA, AU or NZ), £ (i.e. all countries from the anglosphere) €,  Real, Renminbi Ruble or Yen (i.e. BRIC countries) - then refer to that directly, at least once, in all circumstances - or repeatedly if you are making general comments about use or qualities of that currency.

If you are talking about a specific price conversion, then refer to the major currencies directly, followed by the conversion into USD and usually whatever currency is local to that news source. 

A European sub is a unique situation because there is no one local audience. Every European country is native, so it would be customary to talk in Rubles. If you want to make a conversion to be helpful, then convert to Euros.

SaintsFC,"He doesn't specify that the club's ambition has to only be in big transfers, just that the club has to show ambition to keep him here. My problem is that I feel his idea of the club showing ambition will be to let him actually improve the team for once. It's fine declaring we want Europe, but unless we actually improve a team that has generally (for me) looked ""OK"" at best since last January, we're never going to get close to Europe again.  

But the club don't go out and buy players that can do that, or bring through youths that can develop into good players (which has previously funded other transfers in itself). In the long term, the only player we have bought that has been an improvement on an existing or departing player (since our first PL season), for me, is Forster. Maybe Wanyama too, but I always had a thing for Corky. Mané is good as well, but he didn't really replace anyone directly, and has been inconsistent anyway.  

I think that if we're just going to buy mediocre players we should promote youth instead, because at worst they'll likely be mediocre/bad (Martina), and at best we'll get a Shaw, Chambers, Lallana. If Koeman won't give the youth a chance because he doesn't think they're good enough, then we need to address that, but that means the ambition has to come from transfers, and not just intentions.",cyj7vkp,0,,1451735341,t1_cyj6xfb,t3_3z4i2s,1454231997,,1451735071,,False,0,t5_2tboa,miomike,5,5
Polska,"A na to tylko czeka Rosja.

Można oczywiście pytać do znudzenia, jak bardzo nieodpowiedzialnym trzeba być, żeby w sytuacji, w której Rosja słabnie ekonomicznie, a jednocześnie rozwija siły zbrojne - co musi się skończyć wcześniej czy później czymś paskudnym - burzyć z takim trudem uzyskaną pozycję w Unii i NATO. Ale na takie pytanie prawica będzie miała tylko jedną odpowiedź, i to taką, która zapewne jej samej nie przekonuje: bo ""folksdojcze"" są czynni. To, że ci ""folksdojcze"" są coś za bardzo wszechmocni, bo w końcu w kilku ustalić opinię całego świata na temat Polski to raczej sprawa niezbyt możliwa, jest dla nich być może zastanawiające - ale innej odpowiedzi nie mają. Toteż muszą w nią wierzyć.

Ważne więc, żeby przez te cztery lata budować wizję ""innej Polski"", choćby na razie widmowej. Niestety, na wprowadzanie ""dobrej zmiany"" PiS nie mógł wybrać gorszego momentu: Zachód jest słaby i w defensywie, ciśnięty przez Rosję, Turcję, kryzys i odradzające się narodowe egoizmy, w które środkowoeuropejski narodowy egoizm, nigdy niepochowany, wpisuje się bardzo chętnie. Tym bardziej spróbujmy nie tracić z oczu niknącej europejskiej wizji.

hearthstone,"Freeze Mage is a hard deck to play, a few advice

-Always be aware of the board and the damage you can take

-Be aware of what deck you play against and what cards he will play

-Calculate turns, on turn 2 calculate a turn 6, 7, always want to 
keep the minion on your AoE range

-Opening hand, you are looking for Mad Scientist, drawing 
mechanics, Nova and Doomsayer

-Don't be afraid to let mana unspent, turn 4 could be easy just hero power, or turn 10 the same

-Understand what's the deck point, stall the game an burn him down

-Don't be afraid to use your burning for removal or stalling, if that saves you the game

-Understand your main condition on winning, Alex and Antonidas, you can use Alex sometimes as a defensive mechanics against very aggresive decks or Antonidas sometimes to put some pressure on him, he will remove it on that turn, it's like a taunt, you don't need to get 10 Fireballs from him, sometimes 1, 2 is more than enough

-Always be aware of what you have in your deck and what you need to draw

Buttcoin,"Only 5 years? There are large swaths of Europe where nobody's seen a paper cheque in decades...

Other than that I agree; banks have nothing if not money and would be remiss if they _didn't_ put some of it into at least investigating the technology, if only because of the amount of media attention it's gotten. It's not necessarily a vote of confidence in blockchains, much less Bitcoin. 

But the problem in the US hasn't been lack of technology or lack of knowledge about it. It's probably a combination of things, but not that. (even though the bitcoiners seem to like the self-gratifying delusion that banks don't know anything about computers and crypto - despite them having used those things more and longer than anyone else outside of government and science)

worldnews,"&gt; If Arabs failed to create a state due to external circumstances then they do not have a state nor sovereignty. 

I think you're a little lost. The external circumstances clause relates to your proof of lack of preparedness argument. It wasn't an argument about sovereignty.

&gt; What happened with the Vietnamese was a normal progression from colonialism to sovereignty.

No it wasn't most colonies were granted their freedom; Vietnam was one of the exceptions. Vietnam had to struggle violently for its freedom unlike most colonies. In other words you're wrong. 

&gt; What states in the Arab world were created without assistance of the League of Nations or of the UN?

It doesn't matter. I already told you why and I so no need to repeat myself. Although I'll add that this is getting very tedious. You're not even making it hard just frustrating. You make an argument,usually flimsy, I reply with a usually well thought out counter argument as to why yours is flawed, and **you just ignore it**.  Then you reiterate it your same argument again in different phrasing. Would you bother taking this seriously? Is it too hard to admit that maybe you're wrong about a couple points?

&gt; So your proof of Arabs being in the region is that they were once Jews? 

No, and it's incredibly intellectually dishonest of you to deliberately misconstrue my rebuttal of yours without even addressing the argument at hand(yours being). **You said that jews were in palestine longer than palestinians were.** that was the argument I addressed. Would you bother taking this seriously? I feel as if I'm arguing with a child?

&gt; So you accept that Jews are native in the region? 

I accept that palestinian jews, not european jews, are native to palestine.

&gt; So then this isn't colonialism and Jews have the right of self-determination and the right to sovereinty if they can establish sovereignty.

Your crude sophistry is almost offensive. Nothing I said implied any of that.

&gt; Sovereignty goes to who can govern land and people

Remember when I told you you just make assertions about the way the world works without arguments and annoyingly try to impose your opinions as universal axioms? Well you're doing it here again.

&gt; 80% of Palestine became Jordan. The 20% remaining was then to be split. There were a number of deals offered. With good diplomacy and a formed functioning government Arabs could have taken 90%+ of what is now Israel+West Bank+Gaza. However when Arabs failed at diplomacy then they were offered 50% of the 20%. So Jordan got 80% and Arabs would have received another 10%.

I'm ignoring this because I don't see why it's relevant.
Of course there are some problems  with your assumptions but i don't want to digress to the irrelevant.

&gt; Britain was in charge of administrating the land. If you have an issue with immigration then you need to take it up with the British. Jews supported immigration, **which is consent of the governed,**

European Jews aren't native. I don't know if native palestinian Jews supported immigration but it wouldn't matter since the overwhelming majority of Palestinians didn't. Therefore, even in a scenario that maximizes how many native palestinian Jews supported immigration, they are still too few to decide for the mandate.

Would you mind putting some intellectual rigor into your arguments this time?",cyj8rmb,0,,False,t1_cyihymj,t3_3o8z8k,1454232416,,1451738964,,False,0,t5_2qh13,Reasonsprince,2,2

funny,"Well, to get a really comprehensive view of history you have to start at the beginning imo, with the dawn of the agricultural age. Without agriculture civilizations would have never arisen in the first place, so it is very important to understand that first. 

After that, study the ancient civilizations (ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, etc...). You don't have to get too detailed (this is why some people are turned off of history), just focus on the important things (i.e. why things happened and what the significance of that was). Understanding how the government works and the social structures of the time (nobility, priests, etc...) is important as well. 

From there it's really whatever you want to study. If you'd like to continue a general survey of history I'd suggest moving on to ancient Greece and Rome, the Byzantine Empire, the Islamic Golden Age, medieval Europe and the discovery of the New World/the Columbian Exchange.

History is immense and vast, so it's best to pick topics you'd like to study rather than try to take all of it in at once. If you're interested in a topic (sewing, martial arts, etc...) I would also suggest reading about the history of that as well. 

Dates help, but they're not the most important thing to learn when you're studying. What really matters is who did what, why things happened, what the effects of that were.

Personally my favorite topics are medieval Europe and military history. There's something sobering about the fact that, for some reason, humanity likes to get thousands of men in one place so they can destroy each other in the worst ways imaginable for people they've never met.

I hope this helps, have an awesome day and always remember; history only happened one way!

HistoryPorn,"IIRC wasn't Nagasaki a secondry target and Kokura the primary. The firebombing nearby before plus weather meant they couldn't hit it so they did Nagasaki instead which as you mentioned is not the ideal place to drop a nuke (not like there is an ideal place but you know what i mean).

TBH the fire bombing was almost as effective as a nuke on Japanese cities (hell even European cities were vulnerable to firebombing) but the difference was it took 200+ B-29's to do a big city compared to a single one with a nuke. I just checked and they did a Radar approach and were two miles from the drop zone.

That might sound irrelevant considering it is a nuke but the power back then was tiny compared to what today's ""Dial-a-yeild"" tactical ones can do. Something like an F-15 could launch a bomb with equal or more power then the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.

de,"&gt;Im Übrigen ist das deutsche Grundgesetz hier ganz klar: Wer über sichere Drittstaaten kommt, hat kein Asylrecht in Deutschland.

Richtig, aber ein sicherer Drittstatt ist vermutlich nicht das, was Du Dir darunter vorstellst. Sichere Drittstaaten sind momentan nur die EU, Norwegen und die Schweiz [edit: Laut einiger Urteile sind Ungarn und Griechenland momentan keine sicheren Drittstaaten]. Ein sicherer Drittstaat, ist ein Staat, an den wir die gesamte Asylabwicklung inklusive Prüfung abgeben können, weil dort die gleichen grundsätzlichen Rechte bezogen auf Asyl und Flucht gelten wie bei uns. 

&gt;Aber der Grund, wieso man im sicheren Land A kein Asyl ansucht, sondern lieber im sicheren Land D ist nun mal Armut.

Armut ist sicher oft der Grund, aber es gibt viele andere (teilweise werden diese auch rechtlich akzeptiert), z.B. Familienangehörige, Bildungschancen, medizinische Versorgung, Integrationschancen, Vorhandensein einer Flüchtlingscommunity, Sprache, ...

HistoryPorn,"&gt; I have been to the hiroshima peace museum and to auswitz. Auswitz is very humbling but hiroshima is extremely horrifying. Sounds crazy but I am really glad I went there.

Auswitz is a ""never happen again"" type scenario although thier have been several massive genocides (Cambodia, Former Yugoslavia etc) but none were organised to that level. At any given time though nuclear weaponry is armed and primed with the power that would make Hiroshima look like an M80 and that is pretty horrific when you think about it.

It is why Britain should abandon its ICBM subs, they are pointless. Should a nuclear war erupt all you can do is fire a few back. Back when Britain used bomber crews the missions were one way, they were told to land in a friendly nation but unofficially a lot of the crews were deciding if they really dropped to just run for the middle of nowhere. Because all of Europe and any Soviet city would be destroyed.

It's actually suprising we made it out of the Cold War without a launch. The U.S lost several bombs due to crashes. The Soviets picked up multiple launches during a wargame in West Germany in the 80's but the officer in charge refused orders to fire back thinking the U.S would not send 6 ICBM's for a first strike. He was right, the satellite picked up the sun bouncing off clouds at an angle that made it look like a launch. 

The Soviets even seriously planned a ship that would have massive amounts of fissionable material that would potter around Siberia and if it lost contact with Moscow detonate. It would have been bigger then any of the biggest bombs and would have pretty much ended all life on earth. Luckily they backed down and it never got off the drawing board (see dodgy satellites)

The U.S planned nuclear planes whose exhaust was radioactive to fly around irradiating everyone and then crash and go boom and the British invented a nuclear landmine but couldn't keep it warm enough (50's electronics+freezing ground) so thought shoving a chicken in might help keep it alive for 30 days (not joking)",cyja5u9,0,,False,t1_cyj6e9g,t3_3z2f2k,1454233073,,1451743859,,False,0,t5_2skqi,NotHyplon,11,11

European culture is very different than American culture when it comes to theses kinds of things. They don't have free speech. racism and hate speech can get you arrested in those countries.

Also many comments in SRS are clearly meant to be sarcastic or show the hypocrisy of Reddit. I'd point you to [my comment in SRS so that you can understand](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/3yzkgc/dear_srs_please_stop_brigading/cyi96tq?context=3).

E infatti gli incarichi non dipendono dal potere decisionale.

E infatti è Europea e i soldi italiani.

unitedkingdom,"The answer is 'probably not for the forseeable', though it does vary in some circumstances.

All (currently) commercially viable projects have been scheduled for deployment.

Then, the EU and the UK government put money together, gave it to BT, and they rolled out a tranche of semi-viable projects, in particular for more rural areas.

Now we're at the point where that money has run out as well, and lots of people (around 12% of homes in areas where the exchange is ready), will just say 'under review' as their cabinet upgrade simply isn't scheduled on Openreach's planner.

Unless something happens in your area, at this point in time nothing new (nationwide) is going to be added to the schedule for, according to the sources I have spoken to, three years. Even more perturbing is that there is high uncertainty over future deployments because of the political climate - it seems likely in the future that that 12% gap will have to be covered by a mix of 4G, subsidised satellite, and exploring other options locally e.g. communities self-paying, rather than more money being doled out to go back and cover these under-review cabinets.

I've got about 90 emails regarding these issues going back three years, I've spoken to my MP who even raised it at PMQs, the whole broadband delivery project has been handled quite badly (by everyone) and frankly 'the money available to deliver total coverage has now run out'.

There is a ray of hope though - Openreach are *notoriously* bad for having their data up-to-date and it's actually quite common for them to say that you're under review when the engineers are actually due to turn up next week and upgrade your cab. Someone in head office simply forgot to update the schedule. Some people prefer to see if there are any road closures scheduled (as the Openreach engineers have to let the council know in advance they're doing works so it becomes publicly available) - as this may be as good an indicator as any that they're active in your area. Historically they have tended to upgrade all cabinets in an area within 6 months of each other, as the engineers then move onto the next area, rather than hopping about in different areas all the time.",cyjagrq,0,,False,t3_3z2pyu,t3_3z2pyu,1454233217,,1451744743,,False,0,t5_2qhqb,CMDR_Dreaming,1,1

&gt; How much does Madman charge for postage?

&gt; Within Australia - FREE SHIPPING. Free shipping Australia-wide on all online purchases over $30! Pre-ordered items that are sent later may incur a further charge, this again includes all items released at the same time. We encourage customers to submit preorders separately for ease of tracking. Our system does not split orders automatically. We advise 7-10 working days wait for processing before going out to post, although we will normally keep this to a much lower timeframe. International orders will depend on weight and location. The price will be calculated by the website for you as you go through checkout. A rough guide is that a single DVD is 110 grams, and packaging for up to 5 DVDs is 90 grams. Pricing to US/UK/Europe for a single DVD will be between AUD$8 and AUD$9.5, and scales up with more/larger items. International orders are sent by standard airmail, in most cases this is a 2-3 week delivery time after our normal processing period.

I don't know why you're calling me a narcissist - I'm not taking credit for anything.

I'm just saying - don't cheapen people's fandom. 

At the end of the day, we all go for the same team, and more fans is better for the club.

UnresolvedMysteries,"[Maureen Cathryn Harriet ""Cats"" Falck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_Falck) was a Swedish television journalist who, together with her friend Lena Gräns, disappeared in Stockholm in 1984 while she was investigating a scandal comprising the smuggling of weapons from Sweden to communist states in Eastern Europe. The dead bodies of Falck and Gräns were later found at the bottom of the Hammarby Canal in Stockholm. The deaths remain unsolved but later reports claim that they were assassinated in a state-sponsored operation by agents from East Germany.

360 million with a fertility of 3+ will seek to move. They will have to as the land ceases to be arable. By 2030 the world will have moved onto other energy sources. Meaning they can't use money to force the land to be arable as they do today.

They have three choices. Africa, Europe or Asia.

Asia will laugh at them and put them in internment camps. All Asian nations with Syrian refugees simply lock them up in prison cells and treat them as criminals.


Africa is part of the water crisis too. Meaning an extra 100 million on top of the 360.


The only option. Europe. Which has a fertility rate of 1.2 and only 670 million people. Add in the massive migrant numbers that will come and boom minority in your own homeland. At around 20-30% they might start asking for special treatment.

The government isn't allowed to inspect internet traffic without a warrant, a third party (like a commercial suing party as you have in Germany) would be completely illegal. 

The only ones who inspect traffic is the network operator, and they've been trying to ditch that for fear of government requests in the future.

Without being able to inspect traffic you can't enforce the new rule.

history,"&gt; Smallpox is not dead

True, but if our time traveler was born in Europe in the mid 1970s or earlier, he probably has some residual immunity from the vaccination he received as an infant.  And if you know enough to boil your water and not eat raw foods, you won't have to worry about cholera or dysentery either.  Malaria might get you, or maybe even some ancient strain of flu. Even the bacteria that's in the air and soil will be foreign to your immune system.    
    
It seems to me that one would be best to avoid people for a few weeks, to acclimate a bit, then go looking for people.  But maybe bury the cell phone and wallet first.  The keys are metal, so maybe you can make use of them somehow.  But the rest of your modern accoutrements are at best useless, and more likely a liability.",cyjbhdl,0,,False,t1_cyj7sh8,t3_3z2loa,1454233767,,1451747488,,False,0,t5_2qh53,WaffleDynamics,1,1

worldnews,"&gt; Ottomans until about 1700s were also very tolerant of other religions

No.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_Ottoman_Empire

&gt; European history from 1500s to today can basically ignore the existence of Muslims save for the Ottoman attempts at conquest and the necessity of an alternate trade route, both of which are irrelevant of religion.

I think you misunderstand the part that religions played, if you think they somehow precluded the use of strategy, or that it's one or the other. 
Ottomans got their asses handed to them by 16th century, and later stood no chance against industrialised Europe. 

It would have been suicidal for them to try any shit, up until the invention of modern asymmetric warfare, and weakening of European / Christian culture. And sure enough, first chance they got... here we go again. ",cyjcnji,1,,False,t1_cyj8xp2,t3_3z3ft5,1454234319,,1451750196,,False,0,t5_2qh13,i_can_get_you_a_toe,-1,-1
AskHistorians,"I'm not sure if you are already aware of this, but since you specified ""Europeans"" in your post - keep in mind, linear tactics were NOT solely European in nature. The concept of Washington's rebellious army of skirmishers is purely a dramatic one - either to make them seem like underdogs, too weak to stand up in a straight fight but morally superior and victorious regardless, or sometimes, in more recent times in which the tactical nature of muskets are less known, to portray the British army as incompetent. Variations on the concept developed everywhere you could find gunpowder weaponry employed by large states.

To reinforce and to summarize somewhat more briefly what elos_ has described: muskets are inaccurate and have a relatively slow rate of fire. This is the primary fact that helps to determine infantry tactics of the day. If you line your men up, shoulder-to-shoulder, you maximize the firepower at their disposal. A looser formation of skirmishers will simply not be able to stand up to them - the denser formation will fire more rapidly, and no god will help the skirmisher should things come down to a bayonet charge. Certainly, skirmishers cannot stand up to a more densely-packed advancing force - which is an obvious disadvantage if you are on the defensive. Likewise, less firepower means that trying to take ground against such a formation is rather difficult.

Keep in mind, also, the presence of cavalry - save in the most difficult of terrain, they are supremely vulnerable to a charge of cavalry armed with either pistols, lances or swords. This is particularly true if the skirmisher has a rifle - muzzleloading rifles are much slower to reload than smoothbores.

The lines being thin, specifically, is partly because that makes it easier for all the soldiers to fire at the enemy, and partly because thicker lines, while more resistant to cavalry charges, are more vulnerable to cannon fire.

Linear formations also help to maximize flexibility in a time when drums, horns, couriers and shouting really loudly was the best way to communicate. This is why a large part of why men marched in columns - the formation could easily swing about in an organized fashion and form a line or a square (the other reason being, of course, that a column is easy to lead, since the men further back follow the ones in front; therefore officers can focus on that front, controlling the pace and direction of the march).

Now, skirmishers were certainly not worthless. But they had a specialized role, and were used appropriately by most professional linear armies. Much like how not every soldier today is a sniper, not every soldier back then could be a skirmisher.

edit: This is somewhat belated, and I don't imagine most people who've read this thread will see it, but it's also worth noting the absolutely huge amount of smoke produced by ancient firearms. It is simply not possible, except under unusual circumstances, to fire a shot without giving away your position. Which rather exacerbates the issues faced by skirmishers of the day, as they cannot rely on stealth for any extended engagement.",cyjco47,0,,1451848445,t3_3z50ml,t3_3z50ml,1454234326,,1451750231,,False,0,t5_2ssp3,alguLoD,16,16

AskReddit,"&gt;Germany has accepted over a million refugees in the last year, with the feeling that it is done because this is the right thing to do

don't act like this went over smoothly. the refugee crisis in europe was a major world headline for several months, and it definitely wasn't ""oh ok they can come because it's the right thing to do."" There was significant opposition. I suppose that you are probably young, and most of your friends are probably younger too, so in your circle of friends most people were probably more liberal. But there was definitely a lot of controversy about the refugees there.

&gt; people are freaking out over terrorism because 10,000 well-vetted 

yeah this was/is kind of ridiculous.

While the far right are just a little slow at excepting others from other places...Both are bad and one must be in the Middle in order to be a good leader.

You must support American values and hold them higher than any other culture ..But you must not fringe on the people who want to practice their culture, as long as that culture does not take away the freedoms from those people..Like Islam which puts women into completle submission ,and to ideologies like Atheisim which deny the very God again that gave them their rights...

Nope.

politics,"Communism Killed 94M in 20th Century, Feels Need to Kill Again

According to a disturbingly pleasant graphic from Information is Beautiful entitled simply 20th Century Death, communism was the leading ideological cause of death between 1900 and 2000. The 94 million that perished in China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, Afghanistan, and Eastern Europe easily (and tragically) trump the 28 million that died under fascist regimes during the same period.

During the century measured, more people died as a result of communism than from homicide (58 million) and genocide (30 million) put together. The combined death tolls of WWI (37 million) and WWII (66 million) exceed communism’s total by only 9 million.

It gets worse when you look at the lower right of the chart—The Natural World—which includes animals (7 million), natural disasters (24 million), and famine (101 million). Curiously, all of the world’s worst famines during the 20th century were in communist countries: China (twice!), the Soviet Union, and North Korea. 

Communism is a killer. And yet some still say they support the idea: According to a 2011 Rasmussen poll, 11% of Americans think that communism would better serve this country’s needs than our current system.

CasualConversation,"I love Star Wars to a possibly unhealthy degree, and it's occupied far, far too much of my thoughts over the years. Here are the conclusions I've come to:

1) When people asked me what I thought about the new movie, I led with ""Well, nothing's going to compare to me seeing the original trilogy when I was 5 years old."" 

There is literally nothing Disney and JJ could have done to make Episode VII that good, because even the original trilogy isn't that good when I watch it now. If you go in expecting it to be this fabulous series of movies, or any sort of life-changing experience, you're probably going to be disappointed. Most of the people who are huge fans now have been huge fans since they were kids, and it's probably not going to hit you the same way it did them then. 

2)  George Lucas is very good at some things, and bad at others. He's not a great director. He doesn't write dialogue well. He doesn't quite have a sense of the subtle things that take written words and bring them to life. 

In the original trilogy, Lucas had help. He had directed American Graffiti, which was a fairly popular film, but A New Hope wasn't popular with the studio, he had a very limited budget, and he didn't have close to the clout he has now. 

Despite all that, ANH had an amazingly talented team of people behind it. The effects were revolutionary, the sounds became iconic, and the (mostly) unknown actors rose to the occasion. The process was much more democratic. Lucas wrote a script and it kept getting edited and rewritten. The famous Harrison Ford quote about one of his lines is ""You can write this stuff George, but you can't say it."" 

But nobody was messing with the Joseph Campbell story arc, no one was messing with the space-opera visuals, no one was messing with the ""feel"" of the movie, because that's what Lucas did best. He's an ideas man, even if he doesn't really write conversation well. 

And Episode V and VI reflected that. Lucas wasn't the sole writer, or the director of Episode V, but he was there advising and offering his ideas. Episode VI was similar, even if Lucas had a bit more pull than in the last movie. 

Now fast-forward to the prequels. This isn't some young director making his version of Flash Gordon, this is *George Lucas*. The man created Star Wars; I think he knows what he's talking about. 

But the prequels get shat on, because Lucas is still Lucas. He can't write dialogue. He doesn't direct actors well. He had an unlimited budget and no one who's going to tell him ""no."" Because he created Star Wars. 

Of course, the things Lucas *does* do well were still there. Whatever you want to say about the prequels, they *feel* like Star Wars. You can pause the movies at pretty much any point and get a nice new wallpaper for your Space Opera folder. There were iconic scenes on top of iconic scenes. And even the terrible story ""about taxes and trade agreements"" really isn't that bad. Lucas can't write, direct, and produce a movie, but he can give it a soul, and that soul is there in the prequels. Unfortunately, I'm not so sure that soul is there in Episode VII, as much as I enjoyed it, and think it sets up the next movies exceptionally well. 

So yes, you should watch ALL the movies. In release order or chronological order, it doesn't quite matter this long after release. Episode 1 isn't great, but I feel like it's a victim of its own hype more than anything else, Episode II is terrible, but again, Lucas' talents are evident. Episode III is good, but too late to salvage anything. 

As for further stuff, some of the The Clone Wars animated series is good, and it's all still canon, which is nice. They're not canon at all anymore, but the best of the EU, in my mind, is Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy, the Rouge Squadron novels, and the Legacy of the Force series. You're going to see things that are completely opposed to the new movie, but if you can hold them apart as an alternate timeline, they're fun reads.

travel,"The Alps obviously fit your bill. Using Munich as a base should give you decent flight prices, it being a major airport. Garmisch, Berchtesgarden, Salzburg, Innsbruck are all less than 2h away. If you venture a tiny bit further, The Dolomites in South-Tyrol (Italy) is gorgeous, too.  
Slovenia, Norway, Romania (as I mentioned in the other post) and the Pyrenees are further nice options in Europe. Norway is comparable to Switzerland price wise. So it might be disqualified already. Then again, depending on where you live in the US you might be able to score an amazingly cheap flight with Norwegian Air.  
Let me also propose the gorgeous GR 20 hike across Corsica: http://corsica.forhikers.com/gr20. Just [look at it](http://corsica.forhikers.com/files/images/calenzana-11.jpg)! And you even get to round off the Alpine hiking with a dip in the Med at the end!

Although I travelled up and down the country with my team, I have been pretty ingrained in the culture from a young age, so it's second nature to me. However to get up early and sacrifice your sleep, spare time and probably mental state to watch a team play half way around the world takes a different sort of commitment that I utterly respect.
It's weird thinking while I'm at the game or at the pub about 5/6 pints deep with my mates there's some crazy fucker getting up at sunrise to follow the game by themselves. I suppose it shows the power and reach of the game.
Fair play lads.

It would be like if I submitted a sketch of Morello or Lyte. It's a stretch for fan art of Riot employees to count as League content but not a video from a League content creator about wanting to continue creating League content with footage of the game.

You can see this by looking at the [MPAA's movie rating system](http://www.mpaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/film_ratings1.jpg) and [looking at its criticisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system#Emphasis_on_sex_and_language_versus_violence).",cyjfhha,0,,False,t3_3z4rab,t3_3z4rab,1454235653,,1451755592,,False,0,t5_2sokd,hack-the-gibson,2,2

3. I've always been terrible on Zed but desperately want to improve / learn how to properly play him. Tips / Pointers for beginners? Video guide you used to learn? Tricks of the trade that people never expect / kit mechanics to know? HALP.

4. Same as 3, but for Lee Sin. It's so hard to ""practice"" him due to people's instant shit talking when a Lee misses a single skillshot, heh.

Europe had been stagnating after the fall of the Roman Empire for centuries. When the Church finally re-established the empire and rallied troops to invade Muslim territories (the Crusades), European armies were able to retrieve scientific advances that Muslims had been discovering. These advances helped Europe rise out of the Dark Ages.

I'm of European descent, and you're foolish if you think the Islamic nations were the bad guys in that time period. The Europeans were the savages who attacked the Middle East in order to ""reclaim the Holy Land.""

PoliticalDiscussion,"We caused the Iraq mess!  Had we not fucking bailed out, Iraq would be stable.  We bailed out when we *knew* Iraq could not defend itself, and then sat on our hands and watched a genocide unfold.  That's absolutely despicable.  

&gt;I also ask the question why are our so called European allies doing so little in the fight against ISIS?

Your comment reminds me of this:  

""Reports of the attack in the New York Times conveyed a scene of indifference from neighbors who failed to come to Genovese's aid; thirty-seven or thirty-eight witnesses supposedly saw or heard the attack and did not call the police.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese

Second of all, Europe lacks the capability to deploy troops abroad and keep them supplied.  Only the US can do that, and to an extent Russia.  

Our ""allies"" in NATO cannot even manage to spend 2% of their GDP on defense.  When France wanted to fight al qaeda in Niger, they needed to beg the USAF to take them there.

&gt;Unless ISIS gets a navy the United States is relatively safe from ISIS barring terrorism.

XFiles,"They aren't trying to keep the cure to the virus a secret from the general public. They are trying to keep the fact that they are dealing with aliens a secret. With that being said, the Syndicate doesn't want the aliens to know they are woking on a vaccine.

They knew the virus could control people, but the mutation, that the virus is using people to gestate a new type of E.B.E., is something the bad guys had no idea could happen. That's why they were worried that the aliens' true intention is to repopulate the Earth.

The Syndicate's place in the alien colonist's plans is inspired by the Vichy government deal with the nazis during the occupation of Europe. The aliens would take over, but would spare the Syndicate members from being enslaved, and grant them a small level of authority, as long as they collaborated with their cause.

As for the black oil during the scene with the primitive alien, it is never 100% clear if the black oil is the alien's bloodstream, or if the alien was infected with the black oil. During the series run, sometimes they would refer to the black oil as the ""aliens' lifeforce"", and other times it would look like the black oil was a tool used by the aliens to control other beings, but that the aliens were also scared of getting infected with it. Alien blood was shown as being green more often than not. The writers were making it up as they went along.
